16日午前10時から会議議案が可決されたことを受けて、今後、180日以内に弾劾が妥当かどうかを判断する憲法裁判所は、16日午前10時から裁判官が集まって会議を開き、今後の日程を議論すると明らかにしました。また、裁判官2人を指名して作業チームを作り、迅速かつ公正な裁判を行うとしています。ユン大統領「私は決して諦めない」弾劾を求める議案が可決されたことを受けてユン大統領が国民に向けて談話コメントを発表しました。この中で「私は今しばらく立ち止まるが、この2年半、国民とともに歩んできた未来への旅路は、決して立ち止まってはいけないだろう。私は決して諦めない。私への叱責と激励を心に受け止め、最後の瞬間まで国家のために最善を尽くす」としています。そのうえで「公職者の皆様にお願いする。大統領の職務代行を中心に、みんなが力を合わせて国民の安全と幸福を守るため、最善を尽くしてほしい。また、政界の皆様にお願いする。暴走と対決の政治が熟議と配慮の政治に変わるよう政治文化と制度の改善に努力してほしい」としています。そして「愛する国民の皆様、私は韓国国民の底力を信じる。韓国の自由民主主義と繁栄のために、力を合わせましょう」と結んでいます。最大野党

ハン首相 “国政の安定的運営に全力”今後、大統領の職務を代行することになるハン・ドクス首相は14日午後、外交や安全保障の担当者を含むすべての省庁に対し緊急の指示を出しました。それによりますと、ハン首相は、韓国軍の合同参謀本部議長に対し、北朝鮮が韓国の安全保障がぜい弱な時期だと判断して挑発を試みる可能性があるとして、警戒態勢を強化するよう指示したとしています。さらに外交面では、外相に対し、アメリカとの同盟を基盤にした上で、日本や中国など主要国との緊密な意思疎通を維持することなどを要請したということです。その後、夜に国民向けの談話を発表しました。談話の冒頭、ハン首相は「韓国が直面している現状とそれにいたったすべての過程に重い責任を痛感している」と述べて謝罪しました。そして「いま何より重要なことは国政においてわずかな空白もあってはならないということだ。韓国が直面している内外の環境は非常に困難だ」と述べました。その上で国民への影響を最小限にすること、また強固な安全保障の態勢を確立してアメリカや日本などとの信頼関係を維持することに最善を尽くすと強調しました。さらにハン首相は「国民は団結した力と知恵で困難を克服してきた。今の状況も国民の成熟した民主主義への意識と、政府の責任ある対応を通じて必ず乗りこえることができると信じている」と述べました。ハン首相はさっそく臨時の閣議やNSC＝国家安全保障会議を開き、大統領の職務代行として国政の安定化に努める姿勢を示しています。採決の瞬間 国会では歓声も 高揚感と危機感採決が行われた国会の本会議場前のホールでは、与野党や国会の関係者、それに国内外のメディアなど、数百人が集まり、採決の行方を見守りました。そして、弾劾の議案が可決された瞬間、大きな歓声が上がり、ガッツポーズをする人もみられ、高揚感につつまれました。その直後、弾劾を求め続けた最大野党「共に民主党」の議員が一斉に本会議場から出てきて、幹部は「民主主義の勝利だ」と記者団に話していました。一方で、「共に民主党」の議員は「まだまだ国政は厳しい状況だ。早く国政を安定させなければならない」と、緊張した表情で話していました。これに対して、議案に反対する方針だった与党「国民の力」の議員は、採決のあと、神妙な面持ちで下を向きながら議場をあとにしていました。与党の関係者は「とても悲しい気持ちだ。与党内でも意見が割れていて、今後、与党が分裂しかねない」と、危機感を示していました。採決のあとも大勢の人が国会に残っていて、弾劾の結論を出した国会がどのように混乱が続く政治と向き合うのか、関心が高まっています。石破首相 “引き続き緊密に意思疎通の努力を”石破総理大臣は、弾劾を求める議案が可決される前に訪問先の福島県大熊町で記者団から日韓関係への影響などを問われ「他国の内政の話であり日本政府としてのコメントは差し控えたいが、この事態については政府しても私自身としても特段かつ重大な関心を持って注視している」と述べました。そのうえで「韓国は国際社会のさまざな課題にパートナーとして協力すべき重要な隣国であり日韓関係の重要性は何ら変わるものではない。推移はまったく見通せないが、引き続き緊密に意思疎通をしていかなければならず、そのためのあらゆる努力をしたい」と述べました。外務省 韓国担当部署の幹部ら採決の行方見守る外務省では、韓国を担当する部署の幹部や職員が出勤して情報収集を行うとともに採決の行方を見守っていました。外務省幹部はNHKの取材に対し「現地からの報告や報道から、ある程度予想されていた結果だ。今後の韓国政府の様子や弾劾の手続きの行方を見守りたい。今後の展開もさまざまなパターンが想定されるので、予断を持たずに情報収集を行っていく」と述べました。そのうえで「外交当局間の意思疎通はさまざまなレベルで行ってきているが、今後も継続し、地域の安全保障に影響が出ないようにしたい。来年の国交正常化60年に向けて、事務的に準備を進めるつもりだが、韓国側の混乱が続く可能性もあり、先行きは不透明だ」と述べました。政府関係者 “改善の日韓関係 悪影響が危惧”政府関係者はNHKの取材に対し「改善してきた日韓関係への悪影響が危惧される。今後、日本に厳しい立場を取る野党の代表が大統領となる可能性が十分にあり、そうなれば慰安婦問題などの懸案に関してゴールポストを動かすようなことをされてしまうかもしれない。両国関係が根本的に悪化すればビジネス面にも影響が出かねない。日本政府としては事態を注視しながら対応していく」と述べました。また、別の政府関係者はNHKの取材に対し「もう一段、緊迫の度合いが高まったと受け止めている。日韓関係が改善されてきていただけに、どのような影響があるかも含め状況を見守るほかはない」と述べました。2回目の弾劾求める議案の内容はユン大統領の弾劾を求める2回目の議案では、ユン大統領による「非常戒厳」が憲法に違反し、内乱罪にあたるとしています。具体的には「憲法機関である中央選挙管理委員会に違法に侵入しただけでなく、国会議員、政治家、言論人などの不法逮捕を試みた」と指摘しています。さらに「国憲を乱す目的でその要件と手続きに違反して非常戒厳を宣布し、武装した軍と警察を動員して国会に侵入するなど、国会と国民を脅迫し暴行する一連の暴動を起こすことで大韓民国全域の平穏を害する内乱罪を犯した」としています。そして「非常戒厳が宣言される前まで国家非常事態と見られるいかなる異常兆候も見られず、必ず『兵力をもって』これに応じなければならなかったいかなる状況もなかった。非常戒厳宣言は憲法と法律が定めた実体的要件を備えていない」としています。一方で、ユン大統領が「日本中心の奇異な外交政策に固執した」などとする記述は、2回目の議案には入りませんでした。韓国メディアは、国会審議で行われた関係者の証言やユン大統領の国民向けの談話などをもとに「1回目の議案よりも違憲・違法行為をさらに具体的に盛り込み、弾劾の法的な理論を補強している」と伝えています。大統領の弾劾 過去には韓国の国会では、大統領の弾劾を求める議案が可決されたことがあります。2004年には、当時のノ・ムヒョン（盧武鉉）大統領が、大統領選挙をめぐる側近らによる不正資金事件の責任などを理由に、弾劾の議案を可決され、職務を停止されました。しかし、憲法裁判所は、「罷免する重大な職務上の違反には当たらない」として、棄却し、ノ大統領は職務停止からおよそ2か月で大統領職に復帰しました。2016年には、当時のパク・クネ大統領が、知人による大統領府高官の人事への介入などを理由に、弾劾の議案を可決され、職務を停止されました。2017年、憲法裁判所は弾劾を妥当とする決定を言い渡し、パク大統領は韓国の大統領として初めて、罷免されました。弾劾めぐる手続きは韓国では、大統領の弾劾を求める議案が国会で可決されると、大統領は職務を停止されます。その場合は首相が大統領の職務を代行します。韓国メディアによりますと、弾劾の議案が可決されたあと、その議決書が大統領府に届けられると、大統領の職務が停止されるということです。有力紙「東亜日報」は2016年に当時のパク・クネ大統領の弾劾議案が可決された際には、可決からおよそ3時間後に議決書が大統領府に届けられ、職務が停止されたと伝えています。大統領の弾劾を求める議案が国会で可決されると、憲法裁判所が弾劾が妥当かどうかを審理して、180日以内に最終的な決定を言い渡します。韓国メディアによりますと、2004年に国会で弾劾の議案が可決された当時のノ・ムヒョン大統領の場合、可決から憲法裁判所が弾劾は妥当ではないとして棄却するまでに63日かかりました。また、2016年に弾劾議案が可決された当時のパク・クネ大統領の場合、可決から憲法裁判所が弾劾は妥当と決定するまでに91日かかったということです。憲法裁判所では、裁判官9人のうち6人以上が妥当と判断すれば、大統領は罷免され、60日以内に大統領選挙が行われることになります。一方で、憲法裁判所は裁判官3人が退任したあと、空席のままで現在6人しかいませんが、韓国メディアは6人のままでも全員が妥当と判断すれば、弾劾が決定されると伝えています。,Japan,-0.39629484340548515

ハン首相 “国政の安定的運営に全力”今後、大統領の職務を代行することになるハン・ドクス首相は14日午後、外交や安全保障の担当者を含むすべての省庁に対し緊急の指示を出しました。それによりますと、ハン首相は、韓国軍の合同参謀本部議長に対し、北朝鮮が韓国の安全保障がぜい弱な時期だと判断して挑発を試みる可能性があるとして、警戒態勢を強化するよう指示したとしています。さらに外交面では、外相に対し、アメリカとの同盟を基盤にした上で、日本や中国など主要国との緊密な意思疎通を維持することなどを要請したということです。その後、夜に国民向けの談話を発表しました。談話の冒頭、ハン首相は「韓国が直面している現状とそれにいたったすべての過程に重い責任を痛感している」と述べて謝罪しました。そして「いま何より重要なことは国政においてわずかな空白もあってはならないということだ。韓国が直面している内外の環境は非常に困難だ」と述べました。その上で国民への影響を最小限にすること、また強固な安全保障の態勢を確立してアメリカや日本などとの信頼関係を維持することに最善を尽くすと強調しました。さらにハン首相は「国民は団結した力と知恵で困難を克服してきた。今の状況も国民の成熟した民主主義への意識と、政府の責任ある対応を通じて必ず乗りこえることができると信じている」と述べました。ハン首相はさっそく臨時の閣議やNSC＝国家安全保障会議を開き、大統領の職務代行として国政の安定化に努める姿勢を示しています。採決の瞬間

韓国担当部署の幹部ら採決の行方見守る外務省では、韓国を担当する部署の幹部や職員が出勤して情報収集を行うとともに採決の行方を見守っていました。外務省幹部はNHKの取材に対し「現地からの報告や報道から、ある程度予想されていた結果だ。今後の韓国政府の様子や弾劾の手続きの行方を見守りたい。今後の展開もさまざまなパターンが想定されるので、予断を持たずに情報収集を行っていく」と述べました。そのうえで「外交当局間の意思疎通はさまざまなレベルで行ってきているが、今後も継続し、地域の安全保障に影響が出ないようにしたい。来年の国交正常化60年に向けて、事務的に準備を進めるつもりだが、韓国側の混乱が続く可能性もあり、先行きは不透明だ」と述べました。政府関係者 “改善の日韓関係 悪影響が危惧”政府関係者はNHKの取材に対し「改善してきた日韓関係への悪影響が危惧される。今後、日本に厳しい立場を取る野党の代表が大統領となる可能性が十分にあり、そうなれば慰安婦問題などの懸案に関してゴールポストを動かすようなことをされてしまうかもしれない。両国関係が根本的に悪化すればビジネス面にも影響が出かねない。日本政府としては事態を注視しながら対応していく」と述べました。また、別の政府関係者はNHKの取材に対し「もう一段、緊迫の度合いが高まったと受け止めている。日韓関係が改善されてきていただけに、どのような影響があるかも含め状況を見守るほかはない」と述べました。2回目の弾劾求める議案の内容はユン大統領の弾劾を求める2回目の議案では、ユン大統領による「非常戒厳」が憲法に違反し、内乱罪にあたるとしています。具体的には「憲法機関である中央選挙管理委員会に違法に侵入しただけでなく、国会議員、政治家、言論人などの不法逮捕を試みた」と指摘しています。さらに「国憲を乱す目的でその要件と手続きに違反して非常戒厳を宣布し、武装した軍と警察を動員して国会に侵入するなど、国会と国民を脅迫し暴行する一連の暴動を起こすことで大韓民国全域の平穏を害する内乱罪を犯した」としています。そして「非常戒厳が宣言される前まで国家非常事態と見られるいかなる異常兆候も見られず、必ず『兵力をもって』これに応じなければならなかったいかなる状況もなかった。非常戒厳宣言は憲法と法律が定めた実体的要件を備えていない」としています。一方で、ユン大統領が「日本中心の奇異な外交政策に固執した」などとする記述は、2回目の議案には入りませんでした。韓国メディアは、国会審議で行われた関係者の証言やユン大統領の国民向けの談話などをもとに「1回目の議案よりも違憲・違法行為をさらに具体的に盛り込み、弾劾の法的な理論を補強している」と伝えています。大統領の弾劾 過去には韓国の国会では、大統領の弾劾を求める議案が可決されたことがあります。2004年には、当時のノ・ムヒョン（盧武鉉）大統領が、大統領選挙をめぐる側近らによる不正資金事件の責任などを理由に、弾劾の議案を可決され、職務を停止されました。しかし、憲法裁判所は、「罷免する重大な職務上の違反には当たらない」として、棄却し、ノ大統領は職務停止からおよそ2か月で大統領職に復帰しました。2016年には、当時のパク・クネ大統領が、知人による大統領府高官の人事への介入などを理由に、弾劾の議案を可決され、職務を停止されました。2017年、憲法裁判所は弾劾を妥当とする決定を言い渡し、パク大統領は韓国の大統領として初めて、罷免されました。弾劾めぐる手続きは韓国では、大統領の弾劾を求める議案が国会で可決されると、大統領は職務を停止されます。その場合は首相が大統領の職務を代行します。韓国メディアによりますと、弾劾の議案が可決されたあと、その議決書が大統領府に届けられると、大統領の職務が停止されるということです。有力紙「東亜日報」は2016年に当時のパク・クネ大統領の弾劾議案が可決された際には、可決からおよそ3時間後に議決書が大統領府に届けられ、職務が停止されたと伝えています。大統領の弾劾を求める議案が国会で可決されると、憲法裁判所が弾劾が妥当かどうかを審理して、180日以内に最終的な決定を言い渡します。韓国メディアによりますと、2004年に国会で弾劾の議案が可決された当時のノ・ムヒョン大統領の場合、可決から憲法裁判所が弾劾は妥当ではないとして棄却するまでに63日かかりました。また、2016年に弾劾議案が可決された当時のパク・クネ大統領の場合、可決から憲法裁判所が弾劾は妥当と決定するまでに91日かかったということです。憲法裁判所では、裁判官9人のうち6人以上が妥当と判断すれば、大統領は罷免され、60日以内に大統領選挙が行われることになります。一方で、憲法裁判所は裁判官3人が退任したあと、空席のままで現在6人しかいませんが、韓国メディアは6人のままでも全員が妥当と判断すれば、弾劾が決定されると伝えています。,Japan,-0.39629484340548515

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/wisconsin-kayaker-ryan-borgwardt-custody/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Wisconsin kayaker turned himself in after officials say he faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe,"CNN —  A Wisconsin man who officials say faked his own death and fled to Eastern Europe was charged with a misdemeanor count of obstructing an officer Wednesday after he turned himself in to authorities.  Ryan Borgwardt, who was reported missing in August, flew back to the United States willingly, arriving Tuesday, said Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll, who remained tight-lipped on why the man left his wife and three children by allegedly staging a kayaking accident, and where exactly he’s been for the past four months.  “He came back on his own,” said Podoll during a news conference Wednesday. When asked by the media why Borgwardt decided to return, Podoll added, “His family, I guess.”  Borgwardt’s wife filed a petition for legal separation on Thursday, Dodge County court documents show. In Wisconsin, a legal separation does not end a marriage, unlike a divorce, but allows the court to rule on the same issues that come up in a divorce proceeding.  In her petition, Borgwardt’s wife is requesting sole legal custody of their three teenage children, claiming the 22-year marriage is “irretrievably broken.”  Borgwardt appeared in court Wednesday and said he could not afford an attorney and offered to represent himself. Circuit Court Judge Mark T. Slate reminded the defendant he has the right to a court-appointed attorney and could request one if needed.  Slate entered a not guilty plea on Borgwardt’s behalf and ordered a $500 signature bond. Borgwardt has since bonded out of jail and is expected back in court on January 13, online court records show.  If convicted of the obstruction charge, Borgwardt faces a maximum penalty of a $10,000 fine and nine months in jail, Judge Slate said.  At the request of the prosecutor, Slate did not order but instead requested the media not share images of Borgwardt’s family members. He denied requests for a gag order in the case and for Borgwardt to surrender his passport.  Ryan Borgwardt's booking photo Green Lake County Sheriff  Podoll declined to share details of Borgwardt’s time away or whether he has been in touch with his family. The investigation involved a number of state and federal agencies including the FBI and Homeland Security, he added.  Borgwardt, 45, was reported missing August 12 after failing to return from a fishing trip on Green Lake, about an hour north of his home in Watertown, Wisconsin.  For seven weeks, the Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office searched for Borgwardt’s body with the help of trained volunteers but found only the man’s kayak and a tackle box containing a set of keys, a wallet and his license. Eventually, officials uncovered evidence that Borgwardt had fled to Europe by way of Canada.  Investigators made contact with the father of three on November 11, when they say they learned he executed a plan to fake his own death for a “number of reasons” unknown to the public.  Authorities communicated with Borgwardt almost daily, Podoll said during a news conference in late November, adding that Borgwardt appeared to be safe but had still not spoken to his family.  How Borgwardt ‘disappeared’  On the day he vanished, Borgwardt traveled to Green Lake – one of Wisconsin’s deepest inland lakes – with a plan to fake his own drowning, according to Podoll, who detailed the man’s scheme.  The experienced kayaker paddled out onto the water where he deliberately overturned the vessel, tossed his phone and returned to shore in a child-sized inflatable boat, Podoll said.  Borgwardt then rode an e-bike through the night about 80 miles to Madison, Wisconsin, where he then boarded a bus to Detroit, eventually crossing the Canadian border and flying to Europe, Podoll said.  Before his disappearance, Borgwardt transferred funds to a foreign bank account, changed his email and communicated with a woman in Uzbekistan, according to Podoll. A criminal complaint filed Wednesday said Borgwardt brought approximately $5,500 in cash with him.  Investigators were ultimately able to contact Borgwardt through a Russian-speaking woman, Podoll said, though he declined to say whether she was the woman he had been communicating with in Uzbekistan and whether he was with her.  Borgwardt told police he heavily researched how to disappear by looking up previous cases, and that “everything hinged on me dying in the lake” and the “whole idea was to sell the death,” the complaint said.  In January, Borgwardt took out a $375,000 life insurance policy, which Podoll said was intended to help his family.  “In our communications, we are expressing the importance of his decision to return home and clean up the mess that he has created,” Podoll said. Borgwardt has expressed regret for how he has hurt his family and “also feels bad about the amount of hours that we have put in the community,” the sheriff said.  The long, expansive search for Borgwardt was a costly and emotionally taxing endeavor for both his family and search crews, Podoll said.  Borgwardt’s family has experienced emotional whiplash after mourning him for weeks and then coming to terms with his purported abandonment, the sheriff said on “CNN News Central” last month.  Borgwardt previously told investigators he thought they would stop searching for him after about two weeks, officials said.  “He picked the wrong sheriff and the wrong department,” Podoll said.  The search for Borgwardt  On the morning of August 12, Borgwardt’s capsized kayak was found in the lake and his vehicle and trailer were found at a nearby park, Podoll said.  The following day, two fishermen casting along the lake found a fishing rod that belonged to Borgwardt, his wife told officials. A tackle box was found later that day with several of Borgwardt’s belongings: a set of keys, a wallet and his license.  In October, investigators learned from Canadian officials Borgwardt had entered the country on August 13.  Borgwardt’s passport was found at the family home, but learning he left the country gave investigators a break in the case and prompted them to search his computer and dig deeper, according to Podoll.  Investigators found Borgwardt had replaced the hard drive on his laptop and cleared his browser history on the day of his disappearance, Podoll said. He had also reported his passport stolen and obtained a replacement last spring.  Though the county will seek restitution for the taxpayer-funded search efforts, that does not include the thousands of dollars spent by the non-profit Bruce’s Legacy, which helped in the underwater search for Borgwardt’s body. Borgwardt told police he didn’t realize organizations like that existed, the complaint says.  Keith Cormican, director of Bruce’s Legacy, told CNN he spent nearly 30 days working on the case. The first two weeks of the search alone will cost him about $10,000 due to damaged equipment and other expenses, he said.  “My success rate is pretty good,” Cormican told CNN. “To not be able to find him … really had me questioning my abilities. And I lost a lot of sleep over it.”  CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe and Bill Kirkos contributed to this report.",US,-0.9964
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process with the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items which may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  FBI: San Francisco police recognized suspect  On Friday, the FBI told CNN they received a tip from the San Francisco Police Department, saying an officer with the department’s Special Victims Unit had recognized Mangione as a possible suspect on December 5 after seeing the surveillance photos of the suspect’s unmasked face.  The San Francisco Chronicle first reported on the tip Thursday.  Chronicle reporter Megan Cassidy told CNN’s John Berman her team reported “a few days ago” on the existence of a missing persons report in San Francisco for Mangione.  “Apparently, there was somebody at SFPD that was looking into the missing persons case, and after the shooting of Brian Thompson, recognized this person and called in this tip, or emailed this tip, to the FBI,” Cassidy said.  The FBI then sent the tip to New York investigators during the manhunt, the agency told CNN.  CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explained on Friday’s “AC360” how the tip ultimately made its way to the FBI in New York and the NYPD.  “This tip comes from, I think, a victim witness specialist in the San Francisco Police Department who had that missing persons case somewhere in front of them and looked at that face and says, ‘Gee, that could be the guy that is on these FBI posters all over town,’ so SFPD sends that to San Francisco FBI,” Miller said.  “San Francisco FBI says, ‘that’s a New York office case,’” he added.  Miller explained the FBI’s New York office likely sent the information to a violent crimes squad composed of a mix of FBI agents and NYPD officers.  “They look at it and they do a workup on the name, checking, you know, any indicators that guy’s been in New York, and then they send it over to NYPD,” Miller said.  By Sunday, the tip joined 200 viable leads being examined by authorities, according to Miller.  “Then Monday morning, at 9:15 in the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, another tip leads to the capture,” he said. “So you see, these leads are piling up, being tasked out and being worked, and this was in that pile coming up because it was a viable lead. It’s just that destiny took a hand quicker.”  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.",US,-0.9995

CNN —  I’m not much of a hugger. Sure, I’ll bust out the warm fuzzies for relatives around the holidays but I’m not like, say, my best friend, who prefers her hugs to produce the bone-liquifying pressure of an industrial vise. My husband loves to tell the story of our first date, when he approached me with open arms and I maneuvered him into a firm, businesslike handshake. Touch is just not my love language! And if you’re also not a hugger, the holidays are a gauntlet of outstretched arms and sweatered bosoms and unfamiliar colognes. We’ll make it through together! I recently watched some interviews with the lead actresses of the new “Wicked” film (which is sooo so good), and each tends to clutch the other’s single beautifully taloned finger when things get deep.

The Friendship Queen Diaries  It’s like something out of a movie: Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in 1996. Now, she’s a queen in Ghana. Despite her challenging youth, Johnson made sure she and her daughter were well-traveled, and after discovering she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, she founded a travel company to organize trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Her work attracted the attention of the Dakpema, a governing body in northern Ghana. She was blown away when they asked her to accept the title of “Zosimli Naa,” or “Friendship Queen.” The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the centuries-old Dagbon Kingdom, which comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in the city of Tamale, where she now lives. “We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.  CNN  2. Fabric of rebirth  The iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is finally open to the public again after a devastating fire damaged it five years ago. As part of this rebirth, fashion designer and artist Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was asked to create new vestments, or special service garments, for the cathedral’s clergy. Vestments are an important part of a church’s identity and de Castelbajac said the theme for the new look was “noble simplicity.” The designer drew inspiration from Notre Dame’s stained glass and blonde stone, creating a look that he said speaks to tradition and innovation; old and new. The vision was “radiant with color, radiant of hope, radiant of faith,” de Castelbajac told CNN. You can see details of the vestments in the photo above, and learn more about de Castelbajac’s process in this video.  CNN  3. Music on the brain  If you’ve ever shared your life with someone with dementia or another progressive neurological disease, you know music can be magic. Toronto-based company LUCID is combining facial mapping software, artificial intelligence, and music to create a therapy for older patients dealing with health challenges like Alzheimer’s, dementia and even depression and anxiety. The treatment involves measuring how a person’s brain reacts to music and combining that with facial mapping and artificial intelligence. Using this data, the technology can create specific playlists that hopefully can alleviate stress, restlessness, confusion and emotional discomfort in dementia patients.  Natalia Botero-Acosta  4. I would swim 500 miles  This whale puts The Proclaimers to shame! A male humpback whale has completed an extraordinary record-breaking migration, swimming more than 8,000 miles from South America to Africa. The humpback was first spotted off the coast of Colombia in 2013 and seen again a few years later not far from its original location. But in 2022, the whale was unexpectedly detected in the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa. The typical migration route for humpback whales can approach 5,000 miles in a single direction, making this one’s journey close to two times that of most whales. The discovery also marks the first documentation of an adult male humpback traveling between the Pacific and Indian oceans.  Video Ad Feedback This Saudi dish transports you to the desert 02:31 - Source: CNN  5. The power of good food  Hadeel Al Motawa knows that food can be so much more than simple sustenance. She co-founded the award-winning restaurant Takya, located in the 600-year-old historic center of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. Though the food has all the artfully prepared aura of a high-class restaurant, the menu is inspired by the traditional home cooking Al Motawa grew up with, and by her travels around Saudi Arabia and abroad. After seeing the deep connection between food and culture, Al Motawa wanted to “bring that same connection back home, to create a space where people could rediscover the beauty of Saudi cuisine.” Saudi Arabia itself is a country of great geographical, and thus culinary, diversity. For example, the Eastern Province is known for its seafood, such as Muhammar, a fried fish dish made with rice and sugar that was traditionally popular among sailors. In the country’s northern region, where temperatures are cooler and may drop below freezing during winter, traditional recipes focus on grains and meat, like the popular jareesh, a lamb stew made with wheat and yogurt.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Downtown San Francisco experiences first tornado warning in recorded history,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/crystal-mangum-duke-lacrosse-allegations/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Duke lacrosse scandal: Crystal Mangum admits to false rape allegations,"CNN —  More than 18 years after accusing three former Duke University lacrosse players of raping her, a falsified account she shared in graphic detail, Crystal Mangum has admitted she lied about the encounter.  In an interview on a web show published Wednesday, Mangum apologized to the men and said her relationship with God has made her understand why she fabricated the story. Mangum is serving time in prison on a second-degree murder conviction for killing her boyfriend.  The timeline of the North Carolina case begins in 2006, when Mangum said she was trapped inside a bathroom, sexually assaulted and raped by David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann at a team party where she was performing as an exotic dancer. The men were arrested following her allegations.  “I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn’t, and that was wrong. And I betrayed the trust of a lot of other people who believed in me,” Mangum said on Katerena DePasquale’s show, “Let’s Talk with Kat.” “I made up a story that wasn’t true because I wanted validation from people and not from God.”  David Evans, left, Collin Finnerty, center, and Reade Seligmann, right, look on during a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2007. Chuck Burton/AP/File  For more than a year, the school and the lacrosse players were thrust into a media frenzy, subjected to intense public scrutiny and damaging allegations of sexual assault that were ultimately dropped.  After Mangum’s confession, Duke told CNN on Friday it would not comment. The former players did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.  Here’s how the events unfolded.  A timeline of the events  • March 13, 2006: Mangum is hired as a dancer for a private party held by members of the Duke men’s lacrosse team. It takes place at a house on North Buchanan Boulevard in Durham. Mangum later accuses several players of raping her during the party early on March 14.  • March 28, 2006: Duke President Richard Brodhead suspends team play for the men’s lacrosse team, a move widely criticized as premature since no formal charges had been made yet. Media attention intensifies, with early reports painting a picture of privileged, White lacrosse players being accused by a Black woman. The case becomes a flashpoint for issues of race, class and privilege, according to the Washington Post.  • March 28-30, 2006: DNA tests on Mangum’s body fail to link any of the lacrosse players to the scene, according to a disciplinary order against prosecutor Mike Nifong by the North Carolina State Bar, but Nifong insists on moving forward with the case. Skepticism about the case begins to mount.  • April 18, 2006: Nifong formally charges Seligmann and Finnerty with rape, according to the disciplinary order. The charges are based largely on Mangum’s testimony, as forensic evidence was either inconclusive or absent.  • May 15, 2006: Nifong formally charges Evans with rape, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 5, 2006: Duke announces the lacrosse team is reinstated to play in the following fall, but public sentiment has already soured.  • December 28, 2006: Nifong is accused of withholding evidence and making misleading statements to the press, leading to an investigation by the state bar, according to the disciplinary order.  • April 11, 2007: Roy Cooper – then the state’s Attorney General and now its governor – announces “there is insufficient evidence to proceed on any of the charges” in a statement shared by Duke Athletics. The charges are dropped.  “We believe that these cases were the result of a tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations,” Cooper said. “Based on the significant inconsistencies between the evidence and the various accounts given by the accusing witness, we believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges.”  • June 16, 2007: Nifong loses his law license following disciplinary hearings about his handling of the case, including accusations of ethical misconduct and withholding evidence. His disbarment is finalized by the state bar in July, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 18, 2007: Duke announces that it has settled with the three lacrosse players, agreeing to pay a confidential settlement.  “It is impossible to fully describe what we, our families and team endured. As we said from day one, we are innocent,” Evans, Finnerty and Seligmann said in a statement. “But it took three hundred and ninety-four days, and the intervention of the North Carolina Attorney General, before our innocence was formally declared.”  • October 5, 2007: The three players file a civil lawsuit against the city of Durham, Nifong and other individuals, according to court documents. Durham later settles the lawsuit in part with a one-time grant of $50,000 to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.  • April 3, 2011: Mangum is charged with stabbing her boyfriend, leading to a lengthy criminal trial, and is convicted of second-degree murder in 2013.  ‘I hope they can forgive me’  Mangum has spent 11 years in prison, which she is getting through by reading the Bible and finding humor in her thoughts, she said in her interview with “Let’s Talk with Kat.”  She wishes she could help children who were sexually abused, she told DePasquale. When asked if she could describe her experience in prison in one word, she says: “Growth.”  Before becoming an exotic dancer, she studied psychology at North Carolina Central University. The transition came from her searching for “validation,” she said in the interview.  “I was looking for love and acceptance from people,” she said. “People to love me, to accept me, to pay attention to me for validation. But you can get all of that in Jesus. He loves us just the way we are. That’s what I learned in prison.  “I hurt my brothers and I hope they can forgive me and I want them to know that I love them and they didn’t deserve that and I hope they can forgive me. I hope they can heal.”  The danger of false rape allegations for actual victims  An advocate for victims of sexual assault said rare cases like this might discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and cause people to wrongly doubt them.  “False reports hurt not only the people falsely accused, they hurt every rape victim,” Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, vice president of communications for RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, told CNN. “There are already too many victims who do not report the crime for fear of not being believed. After a false report in such a high-profile case, even more survivors may be reluctant to come forward out of fear that law enforcement will not believe them.”  A study published by Violence Against Women in 2010 found that false sexual assault reports range from between 2 to 10 percent. A majority of sexual assaults, an estimated 63 percent, are never reported to the police, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.  Kaleba said she encourages people to consider the nearly half million victims in the US of rape and sexual assault each year who may now face renewed disbelief and question the value of reporting sexual violence.  “Don’t allow infrequent, false reporting to stand in the way of standing with survivors,” Kaleba said.",US,-0.9993
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor.",US,-0.9676
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/kirstin-lobato-las-vegas-verdict/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Las Vegas jury awards $34 million to woman falsely accused of murder,"Las Vegas AP —  A federal jury in Nevada has awarded more than $34 million to a woman who was arrested at age 18, wrongly convicted twice, and served nearly 16 years in a Nevada state prison for a 2001 killing she did not commit.  Kirstin Lobato, who is now 41 and uses the name Blaise, cried and hugged her attorneys after a judge read the trial verdict Thursday in US District Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  “It’s been an uphill battle with many, many obstacles,” she told reporters. “And I’m happy that it’s all finally finished.”  Lobato said she didn’t know if becoming a millionaire would make up for years in prison, adding that she had “no idea what the rest of my life is going to look like.”  The civil trial jury found Las Vegas police and two detectives, now retired, fabricated evidence during their investigation and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Lobato. The panel determined that Lobato should receive $34 million in compensatory damages from the department and $10,000 in punitive damages from each former detective.  The detectives, Thomas Thowsen and James LaRochelle, and their attorney, Craig Anderson, declined to comment outside court. Anderson told US District Judge Richard Boulware he planned to file additional court documents following the verdict. Anderson said Friday an appeal was “likely.”  The department previously agreed to pay damages if the jury ruled in Lobato’s favor.  Lobato was 18 when she was interviewed by police without an attorney, arrested and charged with killing Duran Bailey in Las Vegas in July 2001. Bailey, who had been homeless, was found dead near a trash bin with a slashed neck, cracked skull and missing genitals.  No physical evidence or witnesses connected Lobato to the killing, and she maintained she never met Bailey. But police maintained she confessed in jail that she had killed a man who tried to rape her during a three-day methamphetamine binge.  Lobato was 19 when she was convicted of murder in 2002. The Nevada Supreme Court threw out that verdict and Lobato’s prison sentence in 2004 because her lawyers weren’t able to cross-examine a prosecution witness who testified that Lobato made the jailhouse confession.  Lobato was tried again in 2006, convicted of manslaughter, mutilation and weapon charges, and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.  She was exonerated and freed from prison in late 2017 after the Innocence Project and attorneys in Las Vegas again took her case to the state Supreme Court. Justices said evidence showed that Lobato was in her hometown of Panaca, Nevada, some 150 miles from Las Vegas when Bailey was killed.  Last October, a state court judge in Las Vegas issued a certificate declaring Lobato innocent of Bailey’s killing.  That action was challenged by Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson in a letter asking state Attorney General Aaron Ford to investigate how and why attorneys for Lobato acquired the certificate of innocence.  Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled Kirstin Lobato’s first name.",US,-0.9948
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/baby-garnet-cold-case-michigan/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Baby Garnet cold case update: A DNA test helped solve a 1997 Michigan murder,"CNN —  It was the middle of Jenna Gerwatowski’s workday at the local flower shop in Newberry, Michigan, when she got a call from an unknown number.  The now 23-year-old doesn’t usually answer unknown calls, but says she decided to pick this one up in May 2022.  To her surprise, it was a detective from the Michigan state police.  “He was like, ‘Have you heard of the Baby Garnet case?’” Jenna told CNN.  Jenna had heard of it. In 1997, a deceased infant was found in a campground pit toilet at the Garnet Lake Campground – right where Jenna grew up. Investigators couldn’t find any leads on the identity of the baby or anyone who witnessed a person abandoning an infant, according to a news release from the Michigan attorney general’s office. The case went cold, and the “Baby Garnet” case became a known murder mystery in Jenna’s small town for decades.  “Your DNA was a match,” Jenna says the detective on the phone told her. She was related to the dead infant from 1997.  Jenna was in shock. The detective sounded sure, Jenna said, but she wondered how he had even obtained her DNA.  About six months earlier, her friend had gotten a FamilyTreeDNA test for Christmas and Jenna decided to order her own. DNA from other Baby Garnet relatives led detectives to Jenna’s FamilyTreeDNA kit, according to court documents.  Jenna Gerwatowski, left, says the case was always a big mystery in her town. She had no idea the grandmother she'd never met, Nancy Gerwatowski, right, could be behind it. Jenna Rose Gerwatowski/Mackinac County Sheriff's Office  The detective said a woman from Identifinders International, a genetic genealogy investigation firm, would call her about her DNA to help with identifying closer relatives, according to Jenna.  According to court documents, detectives reopened the cold case in 2017 and then worked with a forensics company to extract DNA from Baby Garnet’s partial femur, before sending the results to Identifinders International.  Jenna explained the situation to her mother when she got home from work.  “It was just crazy,” Jenna said. “We were both sitting there like, I don’t even know who (the mother or father) could’ve been. We were both so confused and we’re like, it’s got to be somebody that we don’t know, you know, like a distant cousin or something.”  Jenna said her mother, Kara Gerwatowski, started to wonder whether the detective call was a scam.  Jenna’s grandfather had just been scammed by someone claiming to be a detective, so Kara told Jenna to be cautious about giving out personal information or passwords.  Misty Gillis, then a senior forensic genealogist and cold case liaison from Identifinders International, called Jenna that night, according to Jenna and court documents filed later in the case.  Jenna claims Gillis requested her FamilyTreeDNA password to be able to upload her DNA into a separate database. Jenna was concerned it was a scammer and refused to cooperate, according to court documents.  “I hung up the phone on her, not even thinking twice about it. And we went about our day. I was like, how weird. What a weird thing to scam people about,” Jenna said. “I wholeheartedly did not think that it was real.”  One week later, Jenna was working at the flower shop when she got a distressed call from her mother.  “She was like, ‘I really need you to come home. … It’s an emergency. Like, just please come as soon as you can,’” Jenna said.  Jenna rushed home thinking someone died. Her cousin was sitting with her mom at their round wooden kitchen table. Police had contacted her cousin, who works as a victim’s advocate in the county prosecutor’s office, to explain the Baby Garnet situation to Jenna. It turned out it wasn’t a scam.  “My mom had tears in her eyes,” she said. Jenna’s cousin had “just pure shock on her face. … You could hear a pin drop in there.”  Even though Jenna knew she had nothing to do with the Baby Garnet case, she was terrified police would think she was trying to hide something because of her refusal to speak with Gillis. She immediately called her.  An analysis of Jenna’s DNA kit showed she was the half-niece to Baby Garnet, according to court records.  On June 1, 2022, detectives spoke with her mother, Kara, who agreed to provide her DNA. Kara was the half-sister of Baby Garnet, according to court records.  “I feel like that is when, like, all of the puzzle pieces kind of started falling together for her,” Jenna said. “And she told detectives that, if it’s going to be anybody, it would be (her) mother.”  Kara, now 42, had not spoken with her mother, Nancy Gerwatowski, since she was 18 because they had a bad relationship, and Jenna had never met her grandmother. Regardless, both were shocked Nancy, who was living in Wyoming when police questioned her, would be the one behind their town mystery.  “I had grown up knowing about the case my whole life and then come to find out it was my grandma that did it?” Jenna said.  The Michigan attorney general’s office alleges Nancy “delivered the newborn alone at her Newberry home, during which Baby Garnet died due to asphyxiation, and that this death could have been prevented by medical intervention (Nancy) Gerwatowski did not seek.”  However, in a court filing, Nancy’s defense argues she unexpectedly gave birth while in the bathtub and the fetus “became trapped inside her birth canal.” She “attempted to pull the fetus out of her own body,” the filing says, but couldn’t deliver the fetus and lost consciousness “at some point in the delivery.” When she was finally able to deliver the fetus, it was dead, the filing says.  Her defense argues that Nancy, like the average person in the county in 1997, did not have access to a telephone or cell line, so she couldn’t call 911. While she concedes in her legal filings she placed the stillborn fetus in a bag and left the remains at the campground, her defense attorneys argue she had been in shock after having had no pain medication during the traumatic birth.  Nancy is charged with one count each of open murder, involuntary manslaughter, and concealing the death of an individual. Open murder carries a potential life sentence.  In a hearing on Thursday, Nancy’s defense argued that the case against her should be dropped in its entirety because the state cannot prove the baby was born alive. If the court allows the case to proceed, the defense argued, Nancy’s statements during police interrogation should be excluded because she was denied her right to counsel — a contention the state disputed. If the court does allow her statements to be a part of the trial, Nancy’s lawyers want her comments about considering an abortion and not seeking out prenatal care to be excluded, while the state argued the comments are relevant to possible motive.  Judge Brian D. Rahilly said he hopes to reach a decision on whether or not to drop the charges by next week or around the end of the year at the latest.  “It was a very hard time … very traumatizing and very nerve-wracking,” said Jenna. “I’ve never met this woman, so it was hard for me to even grasp that concept, but even harder for my mom because that was her mother.”",US,-0.9991
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-thursday-hnk/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,UnitedHealthCare CEO shooting: Suspect Luigi Mangione now faces mounting evidence,"CNN —  Marked shell casings from the assassination scene match the gun found on the suspect. His fingerprints match some key items investigators found nearby. And he was arrested this week – after going silent from his mom and friends for months – with a fake ID and a handwritten “claim of responsibility” referencing the crime site.  These details and others, shared by law enforcement and people who know suspect Luigi Mangione, have been mounting since last week’s daylight killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a busy sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of the investigation into Thompson’s killing, sources tell CNN.  A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN at least two of the warrants include the backpack found in Central Park and the burner phone found along the getaway route police believe Mangione took from the shooting scene. Investigators also searched the hostel where suspected killer Mangione stayed the night before the shooting and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  After a five-day, multi-state manhunt that leaned heavily on surveillance images and pleas for the public’s help, Mangione, 26, is now charged in the case with murder after a tip led to his arrest Monday at a McDonald’s nearly 200 miles from where the brazen homicide unfolded.  Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury in the case against Mangione, sources told ABC News.  Mangione was charged in a felony arrest warrant earlier this week. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  Blair County Judge David Consiglio scheduled a hearing in Pennsylvania on December 30 in response to Mangione’s petitions for writ of habeas corpus and imposition of bail, court documents from Thursday show.  Mangione was denied bail on Tuesday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania. The habeas corpus petition is a key factor in whether the suspect can be extradited to New York.  Mangione’s team was given two weeks from Tuesday to file the habeas corpus petition, which challenges Pennsylvania’s ability to prove that Mangione is the person the state of New York has issued the arrest warrant for, according to Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.  Mangione is also set to appear in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, court on December 23 for a preliminary hearing related to state charges.  Mangione’s lawyer has denied his client’s involvement in the December 4 killing and anticipates he will plead not guilty to the murder and other charges in New York, as well as to charges related to the 3D-printed gun and fake ID in Pennsylvania, where he was caught and is being held without bond.  Defense attorney Thomas Dickey on Wednesday also dismissed the ballistics and fingerprint evidence revealed publicly hours earlier, saying he wants to examine it himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”  Thomas Dickey, attorney for suspected shooter Luigi Mangione, speaks Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “As lawyers, we need to see it. We need to see: How did they collect it? How much of it? And then we would have our experts … take a look at that, and then we would challenge its admissibility and challenge the accuracy of those results.”  Still, New York’s governor expects a murder indictment “to be issued any day now, and the second that happens, I’m issuing a warrant for extradition.”  “It feels like the evidence is very compelling,” Gov. Kathy Hochul told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. “I trust the DA here in Manhattan to make sure that he puts forth an indictment that is going to be iron-clad.”  Meanwhile, Hochul is unimpressed by the folk hero status Mangione has attained on social media as the killing of Thompson – a husband and father of two – has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry.  Mangione appears to have been driven by anger against the industry and “corporate greed” as a whole, states a New York Police Department intelligence report that also warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  “That horrific attack occurred on our streets,” Hochul said Thursday. “And the people of our city deserve to have that sense of calm that this perpetrator has been caught, and he will be never seeing the late of day again if there is justice.”  “You cannot assassinate an individual on the streets of New York – not now, not ever.”  Neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said on Thursday.  Suspect hadn’t spoken to mother since July  Until he was found Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Mangione had gone quiet from at least a few people who appear to have been close with him. The scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, he had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  Mangione’s mother had reported him missing November 18 – two weeks before Thompson’s killing – a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. She called police in San Francisco, where she knew her son had been living, and told authorities she’d called his phone repeatedly to find the voicemail full and not taking any more messages.  Mangione’s mom had no reason to believe her son was a danger to himself or others, she told the San Francisco Police Department, but she hadn’t actually spoken with him since July 1, the official said. He had worked remotely at TrueCar, she also said, where the phone was disconnected and the offices closed, the official added.  It also doesn’t appear Mangione had posted anything since midsummer to social media, where posts addressed to his X account suggest some of his friends have been trying to get in touch with him.  In July, a user tweeted at Mangione, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding. In late November, just weeks before the shooting, another user posted at Mangione, “thinking of you and prayers everyday in your name. Know you are missed and loved.”  As Mangione entered a Pennsylvania courthouse this week, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, he yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Suspected shooter Luigi Mangione is led from the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “He’s irritated, agitated about what’s happening to him and what he’s being accused of,” Dickey told CNN of Mangione’s outburst and struggle with police.  “He never had any legal representation until he walked into that building yesterday. And I talked to him … look at the difference between when he went in and when he came out … now he has a spokesperson and someone that’s going to fight for him.”  Suspect linked to fingerprints and gun  Police in New York on Wednesday publicly revealed the first positive forensic match and direct physical evidence tying Mangione to Thompson’s killing, law enforcement officials told CNN.  “We got the gun in question back from Pennsylvania. It’s now at the NYPD crime lab,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “We were able to match that gun to the three shell casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of the homicide.”  A 3D-printed gun was in Mangione’s possession when he was arrested Monday, police have said.  The three 9 mm shell casings had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, one word per bullet, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Police have been looking into whether those words, which match the title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry, may point to a motive in the killing.  Authorities also had been probing DNA material and a partial fingerprint from a discarded Starbucks water bottle and an energy bar wrapper surveillance images showed the suspect buying about 30 minutes before the shooting. Mangione’s fingerprints were confirmed as a match, Tisch said  Along with the prints and ballistics, investigators have been examining writings police have said Mangione had upon arrest, including a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility.” It did not include specific threats but indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday.  In some writings, he referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny added. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  Investigators also are looking at the suspect’s writing in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.  It included to-do lists to facilitate a killing, as well as notes justifying those plans, the source said. In one notebook passage, Mangione wrote about the late Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber who justified a deadly bombing campaign as an effort to protect against the onslaught of technology and exploitation. Mangione had written about the Unabomber in online posts as well.  In a notebook passage, Mangione concludes using a bomb against his intended victim “could kill innocents” and shooting would be more targeted, musing what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.

The statement did not indicate where Kobayashi was or how the family determined she was safe.  The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement they are “happy to learn that Hannah has been found safe” and due to the new information “this has become a private matter and we will wrap up our investigation.”  The family had launched a GoFundMe that raised over $47,000 to help find Hannah. Donations have been turned off, and donors who would like a refund can submit a claim, the family said.  Hannah Kobayashi arrived at Los Angeles International Airport from Maui on November 8, but did not board her connecting flight to New York, her sister previously told CNN. The family last heard from the 30-year-old on November 11 after spending four days in Los Angeles at various locations, according to video footage and photos.  Video Ad Feedback A timeline of Hannah Kobayashi's last-known locations 03:14 - Source: CNN  Video footage shows Hannah Kobayashi retrieving her luggage from baggage claim at LAX on November 11 after she requested it be returned from New York, and she then traveled via LA Metro to Union Station where she used her passport and cash to purchase a ticket that took her to the US-Mexico border, police said. She was declared a missing person on November 15.  More than three weeks after she left Maui, Los Angeles police declared her as a voluntary missing person on December 2. Video surveillance from US Customs and Border Protection “clearly shows” Hannah Kobayashi crossing the US-Mexico border just after noon on November 12 at the San Ysidro port of entry, police said.  “To date the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a news conference. “She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her.”  Volunteers put up flyers of missing Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi outside Crypto.com Arena in Downtown Los Angeles. Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images/File  Before leaving Maui, investigators found Hannah Kobayashi had expressed a desire to disconnect from modern technology, police said.  Tragedy struck the family during their search for Hannah Kobayashi when her father Ryan Kobayashi, who had traveled from Hawaii to Los Angeles to help look for her, was found dead November 24 near the airport, having taken his own life, the family and authorities say.  Hannah Kobayashi’s aunt, Larie Pidgeon, told CNN that he “died of a broken heart.”  This story has been updated with additional information.",US,-0.8042

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/louisville-police-reform-breonna-taylor/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,"DOJ, Louisville reach deal after probe prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor","Louisville, Kentucky AP —  The US Justice Department and the city of Louisville have reached an agreement to reform the city’s police force after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, officials said Thursday.  The consent decree, which must be approved by a judge, follows a federal investigation that found Louisville police have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the “historic content decree” will build upon and accelerate, this transformational police reform we have already begun in Louisville.” He noted that “significant improvements” have already been implemented since Taylor’s death in March 2020. That includes a city law banning the use of “no-knock” warrants.  The Justice Department report released in March 2023 said the Louisville police department “discriminates against Black people in its enforcement activities,” uses excessive force and conducts searches based on invalid warrants. It also said the department violates the rights of people engaged in protests.  “This conduct harmed community members and undermined public trust in law enforcement that is essential for public safety,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This consent decree marks a new day for Louisville.”  Once the consent decree is agreed upon, a federal officer will monitor the progress made by the city.  The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened 12 civil rights investigations into law enforcement agencies, but this is the first that has reached a consent decree. The Justice Department and the city of Springfield, Massachusetts announced an agreement in 2022 but the investigation into that police department was opened under President Donald Trump’s first administration.  City officials in Memphis have taken a different approach, pushing against the need for a Justice Department consent decree to enact reforms in light of a federal investigation launched after Tyre Nichols’ killing that found Memphis officers routinely use unwarranted force and disproportionately target Black people. Memphis officials have not ruled eventually agreeing to a consent decree, but have said the city can make changes more effectively without committing to a binding pact.  It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department’s priorities around civil rights.",US,0.9902
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,New Jersey drones: Lawmakers meet with security officials after weeks of unexplained sightings,"CNN —  Weeks of mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey are prompting heightened security concerns – and mounting frustrations – from residents, military personnel and federal, state and local officials.  While the state’s governor says there’s no threat to public safety, other state officials and local mayors are alarmed.  “I’m legitimately concerned for what the hell is going on because nobody knows,” state Assemblyman Brian Bergen told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey after a briefing at state police headquarters on Wednesday.  “We are literally being invaded by drones. We have no idea who is doing it and where they’re coming from,” Pequannock Mayor Ryan Herb told the station after the briefing.  Law enforcement has not identified the origin or landing sites of the drones, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday. He added that the drones primarily operate at night, often displaying flashing lights, but they turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached.  According to Melham, the drones have eluded radar detection, possibly because they do not emit frequencies or possess evasion capabilities.  He also raised alarm over where some of the drones have been spotted.  “One of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey’s critical infrastructure,” Melham said.  The mayor of West Milford, Michele Dale, reported 60 drones hovering over local reservoirs.  Some members of Congress have speculated that a foreign entity may be involved in the drones, something the Pentagon rebuffed Wednesday.  The denial came hours after US Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, told Fox News the drones were from “a mothership” from Iran that is “off the East Coast of the United States of America.”  “There is not any truth to that,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.”  Meanwhile, US Northern Command, which oversees the Defense Department’s homeland security efforts, said in statement Wednesday that it had “conducted a deliberate analysis of the events” regarding the drone sightings but had not been asked “to assist with these events.”  A spokesperson for the US Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged an encounter by one of its assets with the drones.  “Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  The aircraft were not seen as an immediate threat and did not interfere with operations, Pinneo added.  CNN reached out to the Coast Guard but did not receive an immediate response.  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told WBGO on Wednesday the public should feel secure while acknowledging their fears.  “Based on everything we know, there is no public safety risks we’re aware of,” Murphy said.  “Is it frustrating to have no answers? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes,” the governor told the radio station.  The sightings began November 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. At times, large drones — some up to 6 feet in diameter — were seen nightly in New Jersey from dusk until 11 p.m., with sightings ranging from 4 to 180, according to state lawmakers who attended the briefing Wednesday.  The drones operate in a coordinated manner, turning off their lights to evade detection, complicating tracking efforts. They are not identified as hobbyist drones or linked to the Department of Homeland Security, State Assembly member Dawn Fantasia said on X.  The FBI is leading the investigation with the New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, while the US Coast Guard is assessing jurisdictional responses.  Federal agencies have ruled out any connections of local, state, or federal governments to the sightings.  Melham called for a temporary flight ban on all personnel and commercial drones in his video update, despite official advisories against such measures.  Concerns escalated after drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to military officials and state lawmakers. The sightings prompted the FAA to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.  Unnerved residents have described frequently seeing the drones hovering overhead, sometimes traveling in clusters.  While visiting family in New Jersey, travel content creator Katie Caf initially doubted reports of drones until she spotted several moving in a “zigzagging” pattern on Saturday. The 29-year-old noticed five potential drones, which she described as being the size of a bicycle. “They’re so weird looking and they’re much bigger than normal drones. I get why everyone is freaking out now … I think it’s kinda spooky.”  Fantasia said on X that the briefing occurred Wednesday at the New Jersey State Police headquarters and included descriptions of the aircraft’s movements and federal agencies’ response.  Though Murphy has said there is no known threat to the public, Fantasia and other local leaders have expressed doubt and are demanding more transparency into the investigation.  US Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, pushed for more information from federal investigators in a letter sent Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  “I recognize the need to maintain operational security of ongoing investigations and that this situation requires complex interagency coordination,” Booker wrote. “However, there is a growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state – from constituents and local officials alike – despite assurances that the drones pose no known threats to public safety.”  The FBI in Newark has asked the public to report any information related to the drones, including in several areas along the Raritan River.  “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI field office in Newark said December 3.  During a US Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday, Robert Wheeler, assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, called the phenomenon “concerning” but said “there is nothing that is known” that would lead him to identify a public safety risk.  CNN has sought more information from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and New Jersey State Police.  This story has been updated with additional information.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/university-of-mississippi-student-killing-mistrial/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee: Judge declares mistrial after jury deadlocks over killing of gay University of Mississippi student,"AP —  A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the case of Sheldon “Timothy” Herrington Jr. in the 2022 killing of Jimmie “Jay” Lee, a gay man who was prominent in the LGBTQ+ community at the University of Mississippi.  Jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict after over nine and a half hours of deliberation.  Lee’s body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead.  Herrington, 24, showed little emotion as he left the courtroom with his attorneys and several relatives. He remains free on bond and is still charged with capital murder, which Mississippi law defines as a killing committed along with another felony — in this case, kidnapping. Prosecutors had said they would not seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison if he is tried again and convicted.  Jurors on Wednesday were told they could also consider lesser charges of first-degree murder, punishable by life in prison; second-degree murder, 20 years to life; or manslaughter, up to 20 years.  University of Mississippi student Jimmie ""Jay"" Lee is seen in this undated image. Oxford Police Police Department  Circuit Judge Kelly Luther said he will consult with prosecutors and defense attorneys about setting another trial.  Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee, 20, was pursuing a master’s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.  Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, where the university is located and the trial was held.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee vanished. Investigators testified that they used warrants to obtain electronic records including explicit messages between social media accounts belonging to the two men and online searches conducted by Herrington, including one inquiring how long it takes to strangle someone.  Prosecutors said during closing arguments Wednesday that Herrington and Lee had a sexual encounter that ended badly and Lee left Herrington’s apartment. They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex. Prosecutors said Lee was killed after going back.  “Tim Herrington lived a lie — lived a lie to his family,” District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. “He lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.”  Herrington’s attorney, Kevin Horan, has said prosecutors cannot prove Lee is dead without having a body. He told jurors Wednesday that text messages showed Herrington did not lure Lee to his apartment.  Judge Kelly Luther presides over the case of Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr. at the Lafayette County Courthouse in Oxford, Mississippi, on Wednesday. Bruce Newman/Pool/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal/AP  “He’s the one that’s being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,” Horan said of Lee.  Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.  Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained explicit messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.  Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched “how long does it take to strangle someone” at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.  The final text message from Lee’s phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington’s apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee’s phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee’s car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.  On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.  Herrington’s relatives sat behind him in the courtroom, and Lee’s sat behind prosecutors. When Luther dismissed court after the mistrial, he instructed the two groups to leave separately.  Jurors were chosen from another county about 250 miles to the south. They heard eight days of arguments and testimony.  The judge twice urged jurors to continue deliberating when they said they were deadlocked. After the third such message, Luther declared the mistrial and thanked them for serving, adding: “I’ve asked a lot of you.”",US,-0.9977
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/us/timeline-luigi-magione-ceo-shooting/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Timeline: Before and after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s killing,"CNN —  As investigators work to piece together the possible motive and movements of 26-year-old Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione, suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, here’s what we know.  This timeline is based on information from law enforcement sources, official police releases, surveillance images and social media records.  Summer of 2024  Mangione had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  During the summer, Mangione appears to stop posting online, prompting worried messages from some of his friends.  In July, one user posts on X, tagging Mangione, saying, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding.  Mid-November  Mangione’s mother reports her son missing in San Francisco, law enforcement officials said.  Sunday, November 24  10:11 p.m. – Mangione arrives in New York at the Port Authority bus terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue via a bus that originated in Atlanta, then gets into a cab that takes him to the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, where he stays about half an hour.  There was an interaction while the suspect was checking in at the hostel, making casual conversation. ""At some point, he pulled his mask down and smiled at the at the clerk,"" said Joseph Kenny, NYPD chief of detectives. NYPD  11 p.m. – He takes another cab to a hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave. on the Upper West Side, identified as HI New York City Hostel in charging documents.  11:20 p.m. - Surveillance footage from the hostel shows him checking in and showing a driver’s license, according to the arrest warrant in the case. Records from the hostel show he provided a New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario on it, the warrant says.  Friday, November 29  Mangione checks out of the hostel.  “It’s not your traditional check in, check out. It’s the kind of thing where if you don’t show up at a certain time, they automatically just check you out,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. “We don’t believe that he went someplace else. It’s more of an administrative checkout.”  Saturday, November 30  Mangione checks back into the hostel.  Wednesday, December 4  5:34 a.m. – Surveillance footage reviewed by law enforcement shows Mangione leaving the hostel, possibly by bike.  5:41 a.m. – He is seen wandering around the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown, on Sixth Avenue between West 53rd and 54th Streets, and goes back and forth for a bit before heading toward a Starbucks.  “We have him wandering around, walking in the vicinity of hotel, walking on 54th Street, walking back and forth,” Kenny said.  Around 6:17 a.m. – Images from Starbucks show him buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, according to a law enforcement official.  Image of the suspect at a Starbucks on Sixth Avenue. NYPD  6:19 a.m. – Surveillance video near a deli on West 55th Street appears to show him walking and briefly stopping by a pile of trash.  Gideon Platt, Stage Star Deli  6:30 a.m. – Around 6:30 a.m., surveillance video captures what appears to be the gunman on the phone.  Patrick Laborde  6:44 a.m. – Thompson, the victim, walks toward the Hilton after leaving his hotel across the street, police said.  The masked gunman is “lying in wait” outside the hotel as Thompson makes his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.  The gunman comes up behind Thompson and shoots him in the back, Kenny said. He then walks toward Thompson and continues to shoot, stopping to clear a gun jam before firing again.  Obtained by CNN  Investigators told CNN that after the shooting, the assailant crosses the street from the Hilton, flees northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street, and gets on an electric bike on 55th Street before heading north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.  Obtained by CNN  6:48 a.m. – Mangione is seen riding an electric bike into Central Park at 60th Street, according to Kenny.  NYPD  6:56 a.m. – He rides out of the park.  6:58 a.m. - He is seen on the bike at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue.  7:00 a.m. - He is no longer on the bike and is heading northbound on 86th Street.  7:04 a.m. - Mangione gets into a cab.  7:30 a.m. – He is seen near the George Washington Bridge and a Port Authority bus station off 178th Street.  Video shows the suspect entering the bus station.  “We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” Kenny said.  5-Day Manhunt  The suspect was in Pennsylvania for “several days” after the shooting in Manhattan, according to Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police.  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the suspect traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in Altoona, where he is arrested.  Monday, December 9  In a new post on social media, Pennsylvania State Police shared new images of Luigi Mangione sitting inside the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was captured on Monday. The images show Mangione eating what appears to be a hash brown inside the establishment. Pennsylvania State Police  9:14 a.m. - Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania are dispatched to a McDonald’s restaurant, after an employee tipped off police about someone resembling photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police.  9:58 a.m. - Mangione is taken into custody at the McDonald’s, where he presented police with a forged New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario as his identification – the same ID he presented at the hostel, according to the arrest warrant.  Mangione was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea in his first court appearance in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, later that day.  Mangione has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a firearm, according to charging documents released by New York prosecutors.",US,-0.9823

Ryan Borgwardt, 45, was booked into the Green Lake County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system, a service that provides information to crime victims such as a person’s jail custody status. No charges were listed.  The Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday in a social media post that a news conference would be held Wednesday morning to update the Borgwardt case. The post said no further information would be provided until then.  A person answering the phone at the sheriff’s office Tuesday night declined to confirm whether Borgwardt was in custody. County jail officials didn’t immediately return a phone message Tuesday night.  Last month, Sheriff Mark Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on November 11 after disappearing for three months but that he hadn’t committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were “pulling at his heartstrings” to come home. He suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance.  Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of “personal matters,” the sheriff said. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it’s the deepest in Wisconsin.  After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane.  The sheriff said at the time that investigators were working to verify Borgwardt’s description of what happened.  The sheriff’s office has said the search for Borgwardt’s body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn’t expect the search to last more than two weeks.",US,-0.9398

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-abc-news-defamation-lawsuit-settle/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,ABC News settles defamation suit with Trump for $15 million,"CNN —  ABC News will pay $15 million to a “presidential foundation and museum” in a settlement reached with President-elect Donald Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.  The settlement, which was filed publicly Saturday, reveals the network will also pay $1 million in Trump’s attorneys’ fees and will issue an apology.  ABC News will issue the following statement as an editor’s note on the online article at the center of the suit: “ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J. Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC’s This Week on March 10, 2024.”  “We are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,” an ABC News spokesperson wrote in a statement.  Trump filed the lawsuit in Florida federal court earlier this year, arguing that Stephanopoulos and ABC News defamed him when the anchor said 10 times during a contentious on-air interview with South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace in March that a jury found Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll.  Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and that he defamed her when he denied her claim. Trump has denied all wrongdoing toward Carroll.  In 2023, a jury found that Trump sexually abused Carroll, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, though it did not find that Carroll proved he raped her. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million for battery and defamation. In January, Carroll was awarded an additional $83.3 million in damages for defamatory statements made by Trump that disparaged her and denied her rape allegations.  A judge concluded in August 2023, when dismissing Trump’s countersuit against Carroll, that the claim Trump raped Carroll was “substantially true.” The judge wrote that Trump “raped” her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.  In the lawsuit filed against ABC News in March, Trump claimed that Stephanopoulos’ statements were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.”  A judge in July refused to dismiss Trump’s lawsuit against the network, writing that these definitions were different enough. He added that the case would turn on “whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury’s verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.”  The settlement came a day after a federal judge ruled that Trump and Stephanopoulos must sit for a deposition sometime next week. The president-elect can now avoid testifying under oath, which could have come with potential legal risks as he prepares to return to the White House.  Trump has a history of filing lawsuits against the news media. In late October, he filed a lawsuit against CBS, demanding $10 billion in damages over the network’s “60 Minutes” interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. His legal counsel claimed the interview with Harris and the associated programming were “partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference” intended to “mislead the public and attempt to tip the scales” of the presidential election in her favor.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-administration-big-donors/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Big donors secure big roles in the incoming Trump administration,"CNN —  Nearly three dozen of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks to serve in his incoming administration donated to his campaign or to the deep-pocketed outside groups that worked to elect him, a CNN analysis of federal campaign records shows.  They range from tech multibillionaire Elon Musk – who has emerged as the single largest, disclosed political donor of the 2024 presidential election – to others close to Trump tapped for key roles throughout government.  In all, eight of his Cabinet picks – led by Linda McMahon, the billionaire wrestling magnate Trump has selected to oversee the Education Department – and their spouses donated more than $37 million combined from their personal accounts to aid Trump, the review found, underscoring the proliferation of ultra-rich Americans now poised to shape US policy in the incoming second Trump administration.  (Two other Cabinet choices, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, transferred money from their campaign accounts to the pro-Trump effort.)  Musk has not been selected for a formal Cabinet job but is helping guide a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative and has played a pivotal role in the presidential transition – offering his views on job candidates, talking to world leaders and meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as he weighs how to downsize the federal government.  In all, the SpaceX and Tesla chief executive donated more than $277 million to federal elections this cycle, the lion’s share of which – more than $262 million – benefited Trump. Most of Musk’s pro-Trump dollars flowed to a super PAC that the world’s richest man created to help turn out voters on the Republican’s behalf in key swing states.  Outside of self-funded presidential candidates, no individual has donated more to shape federal contests in a single election cycle, said Brendan Glavin, research director of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes money in politics.  Trump’s donors “are not just getting these sort of plum ambassadorships on the side,” Glavin said. “Major donors are getting positions that affect policy.”  The CNN analysis researched the more than 90 people that Trump had announced for high-level positions in the administration through Tuesday, which marked five weeks since his election victory. More than 30 of them had donated to his campaign or to one of the leading Trump-aligned outside groups, the review of FEC records found.  “Millions of Americans fed up with failure in the White House and federal government joined President Trump in the movement to restore our nation’s greatness. Some who will work with President Trump are among those millions of people who supported the campaign and helped the President win a decisive electoral victory,” Brian Hughes, a Trump transition team spokesman, said in a statement in response to CNN’s inquiry about donors joining the administration.  The total donations from Trump’s current Cabinet picks marks a surge from Trump’s first term. Five members of his original Cabinet had donated nearly $8 million to his committees or to the major outside groups supporting him, a review of campaign reports shows.  Donations from McMahon, who served as Trump’s SBA administrator in his first White House term, accounted for more than 90% of that total in the 2016 election.  The sums spent to aid Trump in 2024 far exceed the donations that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet members contributed to help him win the White House in 2020, FEC records show.  A dozen members of Biden’s Cabinet reported donations to his campaign or major super PACs involved in the 2020 election, giving less than $100,000 in total.  Billionaires in the administration  Musk’s spending dwarfed that of other supporters.  McMahon was the largest donor among Trump’s Cabinet picks and the second most generous contributor, after Musk, among the administration members announced through Tuesday, the review found.  Most of the $21.2 million she donated went to Make American Great Again, Inc., the main Trump-affiliated super PAC that spent heavily on advertising to aid his campaign.  Other seven-figure donors among Trump’s Cabinet picks include Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick, whom Trump has tapped to serve as Commerce secretary; Scott Bessent, the hedge fund executive Trump has selected to oversee the Treasury Department; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, his choice to head the Small Business Administration.  Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher, also was a major donor, contributing more than $2 million to the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and Trump’s joint fundraising committee.  Sprecher is the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and was at Trump’s side when the president-elect rang the opening bell at the exchange Thursday.  In an email, Loeffler’s communication director Caitlin O’Dea said, “Senator Loeffler is proud to be one of President Trump’s strongest supporters for the same reason a historic landslide of Americans voted to put him back in the White House: he will restore American prosperity, security, and opportunity.”  The billionaire embrace marks a turnaround of sorts for Trump, who saw corporate America recoil from him after the violent January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And he has seen new support from tech leaders who are pushing for fewer regulations from the federal government.  The staggering sums spent by Musk in this year’s election helped Trump close the financial advantage of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who swiftly raised $1 billion after becoming her party’s standard-bearer in late July.  Super PACs face no limit on the size of donations they can receive or spend, but technically are not allowed coordinate their advertising decisions with the candidates they support.  However, a ruling this year by the FEC granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing efforts freed up Musk to guide a ground game for Trump.  “The campaign finance system is a joke,” said Fred Wertheimer, who heads the Democracy 21 watchdog group and is a longtime advocate for limits on money in politics. “Musk is the example now of how campaign finance laws have failed.”  He said he worries about government departments led by billionaires who have no “interest in doing the job that the agency was assigned.”  Musk did not respond to inquiries from CNN.  But Tom Davis, a former congressman from Virginia who chaired the House Republicans’ campaign arm for several years, argues “there is nothing inherently wrong about people who made a lot of money wanting to give back through government.”  “The fact that they have contributed shows a degree of loyalty,” he added.  Friends and family  Presidents often reward donors and allies with plum positions – often dispatching them to glamorous, low-conflict posts in Europe or the Caribbean.  Some of Trump’s early picks for ambassadorships follow that pattern and include billionaires who donated to his reelection effort. Among them: Arkansas investor Warren Stephens, named as the US’ envoy to the UK, and Charles Kushner, Trump’s choice for ambassador to France – one of several extended family members or close friends who has been chosen for diplomatic gigs.  Kushner, who donated $2 million to pro-Trump efforts and received a presidential pardon at the end of Trump’s first term, is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. Another donor, Tom Barrack, who oversaw the fundraising for Trump’s first inauguration, is his choice as ambassador to Turkey.  And incoming special envoy to the Middle East, real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff, is a longtime Trump friend and a partner in the cryptocurrency businesses that Trump launched with his sons earlier this year.  He donated $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC.",US,0.9994
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/antony-blinken-jordan-syria/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,"US has had direct contact with Syrian rebel group, Blinken says","Aqaba, Jordan CNN —  The United States has had direct contact with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Syrian rebel group now in de-facto control of the country, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday.  The first public confirmation of direct interaction with the US-designated terrorist group, known as HTS, came at the conclusion of Blinken’s diplomatic sprint through the region spurred by the sudden collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  “Yes, we’ve been in contact with HTS and the other parties,” Blinken said at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan. Blinken did not give details on when the contact was made or at what level. There is no legal barrier to speaking with a designated terrorist group.  “We have pressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,” Blinken said, referencing the American journalist who was detained in Syria more than a decade ago. The US has redoubled its efforts to find him in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse.  The US also shared the principles expected of a new Syrian government, including that the rights of all Syrians should be respected, that the country must not become a base for terrorism, that humanitarian aid must be delivered, and that chemical weapons stockpiles should be secured and safely destroyed.  Those principles, circulated by the US in the days after Assad’s shocking ouster, were further agreed upon in a joint statement by the US and a coalition of other countries at an urgent ministerial meeting in Aqaba on Saturday. Blinken said the agreement “sends a unified message to the new interim authority and parties in Syria.”  Ahead of the Saturday ministerial meeting, Blinken met with key partners in Jordan, Turkey and Iraq to garner consensus around the principles.  “America and our partners have an important stake in helping the Syrian people chart this new path,” the top US diplomat said Saturday. “We know what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders — from mass displacement to terrorism.”  “We can’t underestimate the challenges of this moment and the weeks and months ahead,” he added.  Throughout his trip, Blinken sought to emphasize those stakes. Moving forward, the dynamics on the ground in the region could present significant complications, despite a consensus on the principles.  There was an intense spate of fighting in recent weeks in northern Syria between Turkish-backed forces and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which the US sees as a key partner in the fight to keep ISIS degraded.  A fragile truce between the two sides in Manbij appears to be holding, but the fighting forced the SDF to halt its anti-ISIS operations, according to its top commander.  “This is a moment of vulnerability in which ISIS will seek to regroup, taking the advantage of transition in Syria,” Blinken said Saturday, reemphasizing the importance of the SDF.  In meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Ankara, Blinken warned the US does not want to see any party take actions that would allow ISIS to regroup, including by distracting the SDF from its mission to keep the terrorist group degraded and its fighters imprisoned, a US official said. Blinken also emphasized that nobody should take actions that could jeopardize factions in Syria from potentially coming together in a unified government.  In Baghdad, Blinken asked Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to crack down on the powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and to prevent Iran from transiting weapons through Iraq to Shia militias in Syria, the US official said. Such militias have targeted US personnel and interests in the past.  The response to Israel’s actions in Syria has also emerged as point of division between the US and its Arab partners.  Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has pummeled Syria with strikes and sent Israeli troops to — and beyond — a “buffer zone” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria, in what the United Nations said would be a violation of a 1974 agreement. Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Qatar have condemned Israel’s seizure of the buffer zone, calling it an attempted land grab.  The US, however, has not condemned the move, with Blinken saying that they are talking with the Israeli government.  “The stated purpose of those actions from the Israelis is to try to make sure that equipment that’s been abandoned — military equipment that’s been abandoned by the Syrian army — doesn’t fall into the wrong hands: terrorists, extremists, etc.,” he said Thursday. “But … we’re already talking with Israel; we’re all talking to others about the way ahead.”  A US official said Friday that Blinken intends to make clear to his Arab counterparts that Israel told the US that the incursion is temporary — and that the US expects it to be. That policy could change, however, next month when the Trump administration takes office, this official conceded.  This story has been updated with additional information.",US,-0.9886

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-ban-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,TikTok’s ban won’t be delayed. Here’s what you should know,"CNN —  TikTok has plans for another appeal as it faces a ban on January 19.  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected a temporary pause on the ban of TikTok, calling such a block “unwarranted” and paving the way for the Supreme Court to potentially decide the fate of the popular video-sharing app.  In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that required TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, to be sold to a non-Chinese company. The latest ruling follows last week’s decision by the same appeals court to uphold the law, citing national security concerns.  The Biden administration previously urged the appeals court not to issue a temporary block on the law, arguing that doing so might allow the company to wait months to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, effectively halting the law indefinitely.  “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said on December 6.  What will TikTok’s next appeal look like?  The Supreme Court could make a quick decision on the case. Both TikTok and the federal government previously asked the appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the January 19 ban.  But the Supreme Court, which has a six-justice conservative majority, seems likely to rule in favor of upholding the ban, Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN earlier this month.  “I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” Schiller said.  Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN earlier this month that the Supreme Court may decide not to review the case at all, in which case TikTok is out of luck.  Do you need to delete the app?  Not necessarily.  The Department of Justice said Wednesday that, if the ban takes effect, it would “not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok” for the app’s more than 170 million monthly users. But don’t expect any more updates from the app or the ability to download it, if the ban takes place.  Two leaders of the US House of Representatives’ committee on China sent a bipartisan letter to the CEOs of Apple and Google parent company Alphabet that said they should prepare to remove TikTok from their US app stores on January 19.  TikTok will also be unavailable on internet hosting platforms. The Justice Department warned users can expect the app to “eventually” be unworkable.  Can the ban be avoided?  There’s still some hope that TikTok could remain active in the United States, though ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell it.  The ban’s legislation leaves room for Biden to grant a one-time, 90-day extension if he determines a company has made progress toward a sale. He hasn’t suggested any plans to do so.  President-elect Donald Trump, who begins his term a day after the ban, could be on TikTok’s side. He said in July (in a video posted to the app) that he would “never ban TikTok” — although he did try to ban it during his first term.  There are a few options: Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, though experts say that’s unlikely to be successful. He could also direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month.",US,0.9622
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-shop-ban/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,TikTok Shop was going to be the next big thing. A potential ban could change that,"CNN —  Aakaanksh Autade was iffy on TikTok Shop, TikTok’s in-app shopping feature, when it launched last year. Then the content creator grossed over $100,000 in sales when he hosted a live event on Black Friday and went from skeptic to believer.  Autade is known for sharing tech-related tips and tricks on his TikTok channel, “kaansanity.” He took to TikTok Live for the first time on Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend to promote gadgets like headphones and game consoles. “It was my first time going live, and to make $102,000 in 10 hours was just insane. I didn’t expect it at all,” he said.  Aakaanksh Autade (left) promoted gadgets like the Nintendo Switch via TikTok Live on Cyber Monday. Courtesy Aakaanksh Autade/kaansanity  TikTok Shop allows users to buy and sell products without leaving the app. The sales platform combines entertainment and retail, making it particularly popular among Gen Z buyers, and it continues to grow. It has over 500,000 sellers in the US, including brands like L’Oréal, PacSun and Scrub Daddy.  TikTok Shop raked in $100 million in single-day sales this Black Friday — that’s triple the number from 2023, according to the company. Over Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend alone, the shop saw a 165% increase in shoppers year-over-year, according to a statement by the company this month.  However, a US appeals court this month upheld a law that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 or face a US ban.  That ban could grind the sales platform’s progress to a halt — but creators who spoke to CNN say that they’re sticking with TikTok Shop anyway because they don’t think a ban will actually happen.  “I don’t think TikTok is going anywhere. I think they’re going to figure it out, and there’s so many people invested in TikTok,” Autade said. “It’s hard to ignore how much it means to its users.”  What makes TikTok Shop tick?  TikTok Shop provides a pipeline from discovery to purchase by letting users shop products featured in live videos, pinned on brand and influencer profiles, or tagged in content shown on their algorithm-driven For You page.  Even before the launch of its shopping feature, TikTok had already established a reputation as a place for users to find items to add to their wishlists. A study conducted in 2022 by marketing consulting firm Material Plus found that 61% of users purchased an item after seeing content about it on TikTok, helped by hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which has over 12 million posts.  Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and TikTok creator, said combining passive entertainment with a shopping function can tempt users to open their wallets.  “You’ve got all these people who are spending so much time just being (on TikTok) consuming and creating content,” she said. “When you mix in commerce with our favorite source of entertainment, then we’re going to spend all our money there.”  TikTok Shop’s reliance on user-generated content allows consumers to hear from voices they trust.  Lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk says TikTok Shop's main draw is its ability to let consumers see their favorite influencers use the products they promote in real time. Courtesy Carrie Berk  Social media strategist Keenya Kelly says that TikTok Shop is another avenue for content creators to make money on TikTok without having to leave the app. Courtesy Keenya Kelly  “If you see your favorite creator promoting a product on a live stream or a video, you’re more likely to buy it in that moment,” said Carrie Berk, a lifestyle content creator. The thinking among viewers, she said, is that “if a makeup influencer is promoting a product on TikTok Shop, if she says it’s good, then it must be good.”  TikTok users like Autade also say that the app’s focus on short-form videos gives it an edge over other social media platforms.  “When I click on a product and I can see hundreds or even thousands of people posting a video about that product authentically, that really helps,” he said. “On a different platform, I might just see some words, some reviews, some stars here and there,” but seeing the product in action is different.  Another component of TikTok Shop’s growth is its popularity with younger users. Some 62% of Gen Z consumers say that TikTok is their platform of choice when they need to look something up, beating out search engines like Google, according to a report by marketing technology company SOCi published this year.  “Gen Z as a whole has really chosen TikTok as their premier destination for content,” said Jen Jones, chief marketing officer of e-commerce platform Commercetools. “TikTok shop just seemed like a natural place for those dollars to be spent.”  What would a TikTok ban mean for other social media retail platforms?  Social media shopping is not a new phenomenon.  Ninety-two percent of retailers plan to invest more in social commerce this holiday season, according to a study by Commercetools published in October. The same study showed that Facebook Marketplace was the social commerce platform of choice for businesses, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok Shop and X.  In particular, Jones sees an opportunity for YouTube to fill in the space TikTok could leave behind if a ban comes into force.  She says that YouTube could potentially meet demand for the style of short-form videos popularized by TikTok through YouTube Shorts while capitalizing on its longer-form content.  In the past year alone, people watched over 30 billion hours of shopping-related content on YouTube, the company previously told CNN in an email. In 2023, it launched YouTube Shopping, allowing content creators to tag products from brands featured in their videos and earn commissions.  Experts say that if the TikTok ban happens, it will serve as a lesson for brands to not put all their eggs into one marketing basket.  The Shop tab of the TikTok app is seen on an iPhone on June 23 in Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images  “It’s just really important for companies to have a very diversified strategy when it comes to social shopping,” said Jones. “We know that social shopping is here to stay. You can’t get locked into just one platform.”  Kelly says the same advice applies to individual content creators who make money off their posts and videos, and recommends cultivating a following through more direct forms of outreach like email lists.  “We use social media to reach a group of people,” she said. “You need to pull those people off social media onto email so that you have control over your business.”  Still, Kelly says she sees no reason for content creators to be concerned over the court ruling that moves TikTok one step closer to a ban.  “I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, she said. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.”  Berk commands an audience of almost 4 million followers on TikTok and describes the social media platform as a big part of her livelihood, but she says she’s not worried by the prospect of a total ban next month.  “There has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical,” she said.  Autade still has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, but he told CNN that TikTok was his primary marketing avenue and the platform that has brought him the most success.  Even as the threat of a ban looms nearer, he says it’s still business as usual and plans to continue with a live event in January similar to the one he hosted on Black Friday.  “I’m still all-in on TikTok. I’m still living my day-to-day life, running my businesses, and everything’s pretty much the same until I hear otherwise,” Autade said.",US,0.9961
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked.",US,0.2114
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/sony-stock-record/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Sony hasn’t been this hot since it made the Walkman,"CNN —  The last time Sony was worth this much on the stock market, Bill Clinton was president and the PlayStation 2 was about to debut on American store shelves.  It’s been a rough past two and a half decades for Sony, the 78-year-old company that invented the Walkman and the PlayStation and had long been an icon of consumer electronics. It largely missed the boat on the mobile phone revolution, and while the PlayStation has been profitable, production costs for other electronics have risen while demand has softened.  But as opportunities arise in streaming, Sony is trying to transition from being a legacy consumer electronics company to an original content and entertainment company.  The strategy is working: In the past three years, Sony’s stock (SONY) has started to break out of a decades-long slump. Sony’s stock price in Japan recently closed at the first record high since March 2000, signifying confidence in the company’s ability to evolve its game offerings and steer itself toward entertainment, Damian Thong, a research equity analyst at Macquarie, told CNN.  “If you went back 30 years ago, it was an electronics company, so best known as a seller of hardware,” Thong said. “But today, the company is primarily generating profits off of entertainment, which is games, music and (TV and movies).”  Less hardware, more content  Sony Group, Japan’s third largest company by market value, has turned itself around by innovating its games business beyond consoles and making acquisitions to expand its IP, Joost van Dreunen, an adjunct assistant professor at NYU Stern who teaches the business of video games, told CNN.  Sony acquired Anime powerhouse Crunchyroll in 2021, and it acquired American video game company Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion.  In addition to Sony Interactive Entertainment, which makes the PlayStation, the behemoth Sony Group also includes Sony Pictures, which produces films like the Spider-Man series, and Sony Music, which includes Columbia Records.  Sony is trying to unlock synergy across its subsidiary companies to produce original entertainment content for consumers, van Dreunen said.  Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal in the first season of ""The Last of Us."" Liane Hentscher/HBO  That strategy of leveraging its intellectual property across its brands became apparent at the 75th Emmy Awards in January, when the TV series “The Last of Us” won eight primetime awards. It was the first time a TV show adapted from a videogame earned major consideration at a Hollywood awards ceremony.  It was a momentous occasion for Sony, which first published “The Last of Us” as a videogame in 2013 before it was adapted to become a TV series released in 2023 on HBO and Max. (HBO and Max share ownership with CNN.)  Without a streaming network of its own, licensing its intellectual property and original content is part of Sony’s strategy to compete with streaming giants like Netflix, Disney and Amazon.  Robert Lawson, the chief communications officer for Sony Group, said in a statement that since 2018 when the company acquired EMI publishing, making Sony Music the world’s largest publisher of music, Sony has invested approximately 1.5 trillion yen into content IP across various entertainment businesses.  “Sony Group has shifted its corporate strategies towards strengthening its creation and entertainment assets,” Lawson said, noting the company is focusing on “new collaborations between Sony sister companies,” including leaning heavily into the anime genre.  In the last fiscal year ending March, Sony’s entertainment business, which includes music, movies and games, accounted for 60% of total revenue. That’s double from a decade ago, when the entertainment business accounted for just 30% of total revenue.  A long road to dominance  Doubling down on entertainment represents a departure from Sony’s origins.  Before there was Sony, there was Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, founded in 1946 by Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka. The company released Japan’s first-ever magnetic tape record in 1950. In 1958, the company changed its name to Sony Corporation.  In the 1960s, Sony established its business in the United States. For the next three decades, the Japanese company emerged as a household name in consumer electronics, producing iconic devices from the Trinitron color TV in 1968 to the Walkman cassette player in 1979 to the world’s first CD player in 1982, in addition to numerous cameras and video recorders.  Sony has also been involved with music since the 1960s through a joint venture with CBS that became Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Yet it’s largely been known for its electronics.

Aflo/Shutterstock  The 1990s were a high point for Sony as it broke into the world of gaming consoles. With the release of the PlayStation in 1994, Sony disrupted the arcade and gaming industry.  Since the 1990s, Sony has been a dominant player in the videogame console business with iterations of the PlayStation. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, which has consistently outsold its main competitors like Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Nintendo’s Switch, according to data from Ampere Analysis, an analytics firm for the games business.  Van Dreunen said that Sony is also looking to evolve in gaming beyond its console business, looking for new audiences and methods of distribution.  “We’re currently going through a softer period in gaming, and so it really raises the stakes for companies like, what’s next?” he said. “How do you as the dominant console maker continue to innovate and continue to grow your business?”  An original PlayStation is pictured at a display of various memorabilia in the lobby of the Sony headquarters building in central Tokyo on November 27, 2024.

Sony has tried to diversify its strategy toward gaming, including publishing a videogame called Helldivers 2 across PlayStation5 and also PC. Helldivers 2 was a hit for Sony and sold over 12 million copies within three months of its release, according to Anna Kerr, a research manager for games at Ampere Analytics.  “The games business is spreading out its IP,” NYU Stern’s van Dreunen said. “It’s looking for new ways to reach customers, to expand that customer reach.”  In November, Sony announced a 69% percent jump in net quarterly profit, driven in part by its game segment. The company has had consistently strong quarters this year, driven by profitability in its games.  The company is now in talks to acquire Kadokawa, a Japanese videogame powerhouse that produces the popular videogame “Elden Ring,” according to people familiar with the matter.  There have been some headwinds: Sony’s rollout of the “Concord” vieogame and Sony Pictures’ latest installment of the Spider-Man universe were largely flops among fans this year. However, they are trial and error runs, van Dreunen said, and manageable expenditures for a company that has denoted 1.8 trillion yen ($11 billion) for acquisitions and stock buybacks through March 2027.  In May, at Sony’s annual investor conference, Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida said that the company was embracing a “creative entertainment vision.”  Sony’s emergence as an entertainment company was not always certain, Thong said.  “Sony had some years of quite substantial pain, I would say,” Thong said. “And I think to their credit, they managed to weather and see through it.”  Bringing Sony IP to the big screen  Van Dreunen said in the past, there wasn’t as much demand for videogame adaptations for movie and TV. Yet “The Last of Us” showed that Sony had an opportunity to bring more Sony IP to the big screen.  Before “The Last of Us,” Sony also tried its hand at videogame adaptation with “Uncharted,” a 2022 movie featuring actor Tom Holland that was based on a video game franchise first published by Sony in 2007.

Sony is still in the electronics business, Thong said, noting its image sensors business works with companies like Apple and it produces high-end cameras. However, it has shed its identity as a mass consumer electronics company.  In 2025, Sony intends to spin off its online banking and insurance units, further doubling down on its entertainment offerings.  Sony’s stock is up almost 18% in the past month, outpacing entertainment heavyweights like Disney and Netflix, and boosted from investors piling into the Nasdaq, which crossed 20,000 for the first time this week.",US,0.9996
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/business/unitedhealthcare-insurance-denials-change/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,UnitedHealth Group CEO: America’s health system is poorly designed,"CNN —  In his first public response to the consumer outcry following the fatal shooting of one of his top executives, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said Friday that the US health system “is not perfect” and that coverage decisions “are not well understood.”  “We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people’s frustrations with it,” Witty wrote in a guest essay in the New York Times. “No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It’s a patchwork built over decades.”  Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.  “Together with employers, governments and others who pay for care, we need to improve how we explain what insurance covers and how decisions are made,” Witty wrote. “Behind each decision lies a comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety.”  Witty also praised UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was killed in midtown Manhattan last week, writing that Thompson “fought for preventive health and quality health outcomes rather than simply adding ever more tests and procedures.”  In a statement on Friday, UnitedHealthcare said “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company’s treatment of insurance claims” and that it “approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission,” noting that “around one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons.”  Will changes be made?  Thompson’s fatal shooting pushed Americans’ dissatisfaction with their health insurance into the spotlight. Many have made their frustrations abundantly clear on social media.  Journalists have also chronicled insurers’ efforts to twist the system to their benefit. STAT, a news site that focuses on health care, has published a series of investigative stories on UnitedHealth, including articles on how the nation’s largest health insurer uses a computer algorithm to cut off rehabilitation care for Medicare enrollees, limiting clinical case managers’ discretion.  Whether the public outcry prompts UnitedHealthcare and other insurers to adjust their practices — particularly the much-maligned denials of treatment and claims — or pushes lawmakers to force the industry to make changes remains to be seen. It depends, in part, on whether patients continue making their voices heard, experts say.  Angry consumers have had success in overhauling the health insurance industry in the past. They railed against the restrictions of health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, in the 1990s, as captured in the 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” That helped spur insurers to offer more preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, which have fewer constraints but are more costly.  Any shifts in the nation’s complex health care system, however, will not come easily, nor quickly, experts say. There are many players involved, each of which has its own patient care concerns, financial interests and lobbying dollars to influence lawmakers.  UnitedHealthcare’s mission  While many patients and their advocates argue that insurers deny care to pad their profits, the industry maintains that it is protecting consumers from high prices and unnecessary care.  Soon after Thompson’s murder, Witty vowed in an internal message to employees to continue the insurer’s mission of helping “the system improve.”  “Our role is a critical role, and we make sure that care is safe, appropriate, and it’s delivered when people need it,” said Witty in a video message obtained by CNN. “And we guard against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex and ultimately unsustainable. So we’re going to continue to make that case.”  “What we know to be true is that the health system needs a company like UnitedHealth Group,” he continued.  Asked Thursday whether it will make any changes in response to consumers’ public complaints, UnitedHealthcare referred CNN to Witty’s video. Other major insurers either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment, but a leading industry association said that hospitals, providers and employers all have “a direct impact on the cost and accessibility of medical services.”  “In the fragmented and heavily regulated health care system, health plans, providers and drugmakers share a responsibility to make high-quality care as affordable as possible and easier to navigate for the people we collectively serve,” AHIP, the trade group, said in a statement. “Health plans are working to protect patients from the full impact of rising costs while connecting them to care that is safe, evidence-based and coordinated.”  But the recent events may prompt insurers to investigate their practices and make some changes, Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in an email to CNN. This is especially likely if they see risks to their businesses, such as if employers threaten to leave because coverage decisions are too onerous for their workers.  On the flip side, “the main reason to not change their practices is to maintain their profitability while also keeping costs reasonable in a broad sense for their clients and end users,” Utterback wrote.  Video Ad Feedback Scott Galloway says online rage directed at health care CEOs is directed at the wrong people. Hear why. 01:43 - Source: CNN  The HMO backlash  Though former President Bill Clinton failed to reform health care in the early 1990s, his administration’s efforts spurred increased concerns over the cost of care. That cued the growth of the HMO model, which allowed policyholders to see only certain doctors and required referrals from primary care physicians to see specialists and get certain tests and procedures. But HMOs also typically featured low premiums, low or no co-pays and no deductibles.  Policyholders rebelled because they felt they couldn’t access the care they needed, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.  Their angst was captured in extensive media coverage and in the 1997 film “As Good As It Gets,” when a young boy’s mother (played by Helen Hunt) tells a doctor (played by Harold Ramis) that her insurer would not cover an allergy test for her son’s asthma.  “F**king HMO, bastard pieces of sh*t,” Hunt says, before apologizing.  “That’s ok. Actually, I think that’s their technical name,” Ramis replies.  Many states responded to the complaints by passing patients’ bills of rights that limited HMO cost-control practices in state-regulated plans. Employers, who were hearing from angry workers, began shifting to PPOs, which generally provide coverage for a wider range of doctors but have much higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. PPOs have now largely eclipsed the managed care model.  But as health care costs continue to skyrocket, PPOs are instituting practices that resemble those of HMOs, particularly requiring approval of care in advance, known as prior authorization, Levitt said.  “If you think health care costs are rough now, imagine them without constraints,” said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+, a health care consulting group, and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.  Health insurers, however, do at times backtrack when faced with intense blowback. Earlier this month, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield halted its plan to limit the amount of time it would cover anesthesia used in surgeries and procedures after criticism from doctors and politicians. The policy was designed to reduce overbilling and make care more affordable, the insurer had said.  Efforts in Congress  Congress has tried for years to improve access to care and curtail costs, which are far higher in the US than in its peers even though it ranks last on key health measures. Lawmakers have held hearings and introduced bills, but there haven’t been comprehensive reforms enacted since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 — aside from several significant Medicare drug cost provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.  An effort to improve the prior authorization process in Medicare Advantage plans failed to advance in the Senate in 2022 after the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost about $16 billion over a decade.  However, there is now more bipartisan appetite on Capitol Hill to enact reforms, said Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive and vocal critic of the health care industry. Lawmakers reintroduced the prior authorization bill, which now comes with a zero cost estimate, and released a framework to establish so-called site-neutral payments in Medicare, under which Medicare would pay the same rate for a service provided in a hospital outpatient department, an ambulatory surgical center or physician’s office.  Plus, lawmakers are looking at reforms to the pharmacy benefit manager industry, which serves as a middleman between health insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers.  Republicans, who will control Congress starting in January, will be looking for cost savings to offset extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Whitlock said. That could push them to pass measures that would save the government money, such as site-neutral payments.  Meanwhile, the murder of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO will remain in the news as the case against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, winds its way through the court system. That will keep public frustration with health insurers in the spotlight – and could help advance legislation on Capitol Hill, Potter said.  “It will be a years long fight, but it’s going to happen,” he said. “Some kind of reform is inevitable.”",US,0.9982

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/wisconsin-kayaker-ryan-borgwardt-custody/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Wisconsin kayaker turned himself in after officials say he faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe,"CNN —  A Wisconsin man who officials say faked his own death and fled to Eastern Europe was charged with a misdemeanor count of obstructing an officer Wednesday after he turned himself in to authorities.  Ryan Borgwardt, who was reported missing in August, flew back to the United States willingly, arriving Tuesday, said Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll, who remained tight-lipped on why the man left his wife and three children by allegedly staging a kayaking accident, and where exactly he’s been for the past four months.  “He came back on his own,” said Podoll during a news conference Wednesday. When asked by the media why Borgwardt decided to return, Podoll added, “His family, I guess.”  Borgwardt’s wife filed a petition for legal separation on Thursday, Dodge County court documents show. In Wisconsin, a legal separation does not end a marriage, unlike a divorce, but allows the court to rule on the same issues that come up in a divorce proceeding.  In her petition, Borgwardt’s wife is requesting sole legal custody of their three teenage children, claiming the 22-year marriage is “irretrievably broken.”  Borgwardt appeared in court Wednesday and said he could not afford an attorney and offered to represent himself. Circuit Court Judge Mark T. Slate reminded the defendant he has the right to a court-appointed attorney and could request one if needed.  Slate entered a not guilty plea on Borgwardt’s behalf and ordered a $500 signature bond. Borgwardt has since bonded out of jail and is expected back in court on January 13, online court records show.  If convicted of the obstruction charge, Borgwardt faces a maximum penalty of a $10,000 fine and nine months in jail, Judge Slate said.  At the request of the prosecutor, Slate did not order but instead requested the media not share images of Borgwardt’s family members. He denied requests for a gag order in the case and for Borgwardt to surrender his passport.  Ryan Borgwardt's booking photo Green Lake County Sheriff  Podoll declined to share details of Borgwardt’s time away or whether he has been in touch with his family. The investigation involved a number of state and federal agencies including the FBI and Homeland Security, he added.  Borgwardt, 45, was reported missing August 12 after failing to return from a fishing trip on Green Lake, about an hour north of his home in Watertown, Wisconsin.  For seven weeks, the Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office searched for Borgwardt’s body with the help of trained volunteers but found only the man’s kayak and a tackle box containing a set of keys, a wallet and his license. Eventually, officials uncovered evidence that Borgwardt had fled to Europe by way of Canada.  Investigators made contact with the father of three on November 11, when they say they learned he executed a plan to fake his own death for a “number of reasons” unknown to the public.  Authorities communicated with Borgwardt almost daily, Podoll said during a news conference in late November, adding that Borgwardt appeared to be safe but had still not spoken to his family.  How Borgwardt ‘disappeared’  On the day he vanished, Borgwardt traveled to Green Lake – one of Wisconsin’s deepest inland lakes – with a plan to fake his own drowning, according to Podoll, who detailed the man’s scheme.  The experienced kayaker paddled out onto the water where he deliberately overturned the vessel, tossed his phone and returned to shore in a child-sized inflatable boat, Podoll said.  Borgwardt then rode an e-bike through the night about 80 miles to Madison, Wisconsin, where he then boarded a bus to Detroit, eventually crossing the Canadian border and flying to Europe, Podoll said.  Before his disappearance, Borgwardt transferred funds to a foreign bank account, changed his email and communicated with a woman in Uzbekistan, according to Podoll. A criminal complaint filed Wednesday said Borgwardt brought approximately $5,500 in cash with him.  Investigators were ultimately able to contact Borgwardt through a Russian-speaking woman, Podoll said, though he declined to say whether she was the woman he had been communicating with in Uzbekistan and whether he was with her.  Borgwardt told police he heavily researched how to disappear by looking up previous cases, and that “everything hinged on me dying in the lake” and the “whole idea was to sell the death,” the complaint said.  In January, Borgwardt took out a $375,000 life insurance policy, which Podoll said was intended to help his family.  “In our communications, we are expressing the importance of his decision to return home and clean up the mess that he has created,” Podoll said. Borgwardt has expressed regret for how he has hurt his family and “also feels bad about the amount of hours that we have put in the community,” the sheriff said.  The long, expansive search for Borgwardt was a costly and emotionally taxing endeavor for both his family and search crews, Podoll said.  Borgwardt’s family has experienced emotional whiplash after mourning him for weeks and then coming to terms with his purported abandonment, the sheriff said on “CNN News Central” last month.  Borgwardt previously told investigators he thought they would stop searching for him after about two weeks, officials said.  “He picked the wrong sheriff and the wrong department,” Podoll said.  The search for Borgwardt  On the morning of August 12, Borgwardt’s capsized kayak was found in the lake and his vehicle and trailer were found at a nearby park, Podoll said.  The following day, two fishermen casting along the lake found a fishing rod that belonged to Borgwardt, his wife told officials. A tackle box was found later that day with several of Borgwardt’s belongings: a set of keys, a wallet and his license.  In October, investigators learned from Canadian officials Borgwardt had entered the country on August 13.  Borgwardt’s passport was found at the family home, but learning he left the country gave investigators a break in the case and prompted them to search his computer and dig deeper, according to Podoll.  Investigators found Borgwardt had replaced the hard drive on his laptop and cleared his browser history on the day of his disappearance, Podoll said. He had also reported his passport stolen and obtained a replacement last spring.  Though the county will seek restitution for the taxpayer-funded search efforts, that does not include the thousands of dollars spent by the non-profit Bruce’s Legacy, which helped in the underwater search for Borgwardt’s body. Borgwardt told police he didn’t realize organizations like that existed, the complaint says.  Keith Cormican, director of Bruce’s Legacy, told CNN he spent nearly 30 days working on the case. The first two weeks of the search alone will cost him about $10,000 due to damaged equipment and other expenses, he said.  “My success rate is pretty good,” Cormican told CNN. “To not be able to find him … really had me questioning my abilities. And I lost a lot of sleep over it.”  CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe and Bill Kirkos contributed to this report.",US,-0.9964
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process with the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items which may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  FBI: San Francisco police recognized suspect  On Friday, the FBI told CNN they received a tip from the San Francisco Police Department, saying an officer with the department’s Special Victims Unit had recognized Mangione as a possible suspect on December 5 after seeing the surveillance photos of the suspect’s unmasked face.  The San Francisco Chronicle first reported on the tip Thursday.  Chronicle reporter Megan Cassidy told CNN’s John Berman her team reported “a few days ago” on the existence of a missing persons report in San Francisco for Mangione.  “Apparently, there was somebody at SFPD that was looking into the missing persons case, and after the shooting of Brian Thompson, recognized this person and called in this tip, or emailed this tip, to the FBI,” Cassidy said.  The FBI then sent the tip to New York investigators during the manhunt, the agency told CNN.  CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explained on Friday’s “AC360” how the tip ultimately made its way to the FBI in New York and the NYPD.  “This tip comes from, I think, a victim witness specialist in the San Francisco Police Department who had that missing persons case somewhere in front of them and looked at that face and says, ‘Gee, that could be the guy that is on these FBI posters all over town,’ so SFPD sends that to San Francisco FBI,” Miller said.  “San Francisco FBI says, ‘that’s a New York office case,’” he added.  Miller explained the FBI’s New York office likely sent the information to a violent crimes squad composed of a mix of FBI agents and NYPD officers.  “They look at it and they do a workup on the name, checking, you know, any indicators that guy’s been in New York, and then they send it over to NYPD,” Miller said.  By Sunday, the tip joined 200 viable leads being examined by authorities, according to Miller.  “Then Monday morning, at 9:15 in the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, another tip leads to the capture,” he said. “So you see, these leads are piling up, being tasked out and being worked, and this was in that pile coming up because it was a viable lead. It’s just that destiny took a hand quicker.”  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.",US,-0.9995

Sure, I’ll bust out the warm fuzzies for relatives around the holidays but I’m not like, say, my best friend, who prefers her hugs to produce the bone-liquifying pressure of an industrial vise. My husband loves to tell the story of our first date, when he approached me with open arms and I maneuvered him into a firm, businesslike handshake. Touch is just not my love language! And if you’re also not a hugger, the holidays are a gauntlet of outstretched arms and sweatered bosoms and unfamiliar colognes. We’ll make it through together!

The Friendship Queen Diaries  It’s like something out of a movie: Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in 1996. Now, she’s a queen in Ghana. Despite her challenging youth, Johnson made sure she and her daughter were well-traveled, and after discovering she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, she founded a travel company to organize trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Her work attracted the attention of the Dakpema, a governing body in northern Ghana. She was blown away when they asked her to accept the title of “Zosimli Naa,” or “Friendship Queen.” The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the centuries-old Dagbon Kingdom, which comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in the city of Tamale, where she now lives. “We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.  CNN  2. Fabric of rebirth  The iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is finally open to the public again after a devastating fire damaged it five years ago. As part of this rebirth, fashion designer and artist Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was asked to create new vestments, or special service garments, for the cathedral’s clergy. Vestments are an important part of a church’s identity and de Castelbajac said the theme for the new look was “noble simplicity.” The designer drew inspiration from Notre Dame’s stained glass and blonde stone, creating a look that he said speaks to tradition and innovation; old and new. The vision was “radiant with color, radiant of hope, radiant of faith,” de Castelbajac told CNN. You can see details of the vestments in the photo above, and learn more about de Castelbajac’s process in this video.  CNN  3.

Toronto-based company LUCID is combining facial mapping software, artificial intelligence, and music to create a therapy for older patients dealing with health challenges like Alzheimer’s, dementia and even depression and anxiety. The treatment involves measuring how a person’s brain reacts to music and combining that with facial mapping and artificial intelligence. Using this data, the technology can create specific playlists that hopefully can alleviate stress, restlessness, confusion and emotional discomfort in dementia patients.  Natalia Botero-Acosta  4. I would swim 500 miles  This whale puts The Proclaimers to shame! A male humpback whale has completed an extraordinary record-breaking migration, swimming more than 8,000 miles from South America to Africa. The humpback was first spotted off the coast of Colombia in 2013 and seen again a few years later not far from its original location. But in 2022, the whale was unexpectedly detected in the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa. The typical migration route for humpback whales can approach 5,000 miles in a single direction, making this one’s journey close to two times that of most whales. The discovery also marks the first documentation of an adult male humpback traveling between the Pacific and Indian oceans.

She co-founded the award-winning restaurant Takya, located in the 600-year-old historic center of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. Though the food has all the artfully prepared aura of a high-class restaurant, the menu is inspired by the traditional home cooking Al Motawa grew up with, and by her travels around Saudi Arabia and abroad. After seeing the deep connection between food and culture, Al Motawa wanted to “bring that same connection back home, to create a space where people could rediscover the beauty of Saudi cuisine.” Saudi Arabia itself is a country of great geographical, and thus culinary, diversity. For example, the Eastern Province is known for its seafood, such as Muhammar, a fried fish dish made with rice and sugar that was traditionally popular among sailors. In the country’s northern region, where temperatures are cooler and may drop below freezing during winter, traditional recipes focus on grains and meat, like the popular jareesh, a lamb stew made with wheat and yogurt.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Downtown San Francisco experiences first tornado warning in recorded history,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said. Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and about 300 miles northwest of Sacramento.",US,-0.989
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/crystal-mangum-duke-lacrosse-allegations/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Duke lacrosse scandal: Crystal Mangum admits to false rape allegations,"CNN —  More than 18 years after accusing three former Duke University lacrosse players of raping her, a falsified account she shared in graphic detail, Crystal Mangum has admitted she lied about the encounter.  In an interview on a web show published Wednesday, Mangum apologized to the men and said her relationship with God has made her understand why she fabricated the story. Mangum is serving time in prison on a second-degree murder conviction for killing her boyfriend.  The timeline of the North Carolina case begins in 2006, when Mangum said she was trapped inside a bathroom, sexually assaulted and raped by David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann at a team party where she was performing as an exotic dancer. The men were arrested following her allegations.  “I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn’t, and that was wrong. And I betrayed the trust of a lot of other people who believed in me,” Mangum said on Katerena DePasquale’s show, “Let’s Talk with Kat.” “I made up a story that wasn’t true because I wanted validation from people and not from God.”  David Evans, left, Collin Finnerty, center, and Reade Seligmann, right, look on during a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2007. Chuck Burton/AP/File  For more than a year, the school and the lacrosse players were thrust into a media frenzy, subjected to intense public scrutiny and damaging allegations of sexual assault that were ultimately dropped.  After Mangum’s confession, Duke told CNN on Friday it would not comment. The former players did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.  Here’s how the events unfolded.  A timeline of the events  • March 13, 2006: Mangum is hired as a dancer for a private party held by members of the Duke men’s lacrosse team. It takes place at a house on North Buchanan Boulevard in Durham. Mangum later accuses several players of raping her during the party early on March 14.  • March 28, 2006: Duke President Richard Brodhead suspends team play for the men’s lacrosse team, a move widely criticized as premature since no formal charges had been made yet. Media attention intensifies, with early reports painting a picture of privileged, White lacrosse players being accused by a Black woman. The case becomes a flashpoint for issues of race, class and privilege, according to the Washington Post.  • March 28-30, 2006: DNA tests on Mangum’s body fail to link any of the lacrosse players to the scene, according to a disciplinary order against prosecutor Mike Nifong by the North Carolina State Bar, but Nifong insists on moving forward with the case. Skepticism about the case begins to mount.  • April 18, 2006: Nifong formally charges Seligmann and Finnerty with rape, according to the disciplinary order. The charges are based largely on Mangum’s testimony, as forensic evidence was either inconclusive or absent.  • May 15, 2006: Nifong formally charges Evans with rape, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 5, 2006: Duke announces the lacrosse team is reinstated to play in the following fall, but public sentiment has already soured.  • December 28, 2006: Nifong is accused of withholding evidence and making misleading statements to the press, leading to an investigation by the state bar, according to the disciplinary order.  • April 11, 2007: Roy Cooper – then the state’s Attorney General and now its governor – announces “there is insufficient evidence to proceed on any of the charges” in a statement shared by Duke Athletics. The charges are dropped.  “We believe that these cases were the result of a tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations,” Cooper said. “Based on the significant inconsistencies between the evidence and the various accounts given by the accusing witness, we believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges.”  • June 16, 2007: Nifong loses his law license following disciplinary hearings about his handling of the case, including accusations of ethical misconduct and withholding evidence. His disbarment is finalized by the state bar in July, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 18, 2007: Duke announces that it has settled with the three lacrosse players, agreeing to pay a confidential settlement.  “It is impossible to fully describe what we, our families and team endured. As we said from day one, we are innocent,” Evans, Finnerty and Seligmann said in a statement. “But it took three hundred and ninety-four days, and the intervention of the North Carolina Attorney General, before our innocence was formally declared.”  • October 5, 2007: The three players file a civil lawsuit against the city of Durham, Nifong and other individuals, according to court documents. Durham later settles the lawsuit in part with a one-time grant of $50,000 to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.  • April 3, 2011: Mangum is charged with stabbing her boyfriend, leading to a lengthy criminal trial, and is convicted of second-degree murder in 2013.  ‘I hope they can forgive me’  Mangum has spent 11 years in prison, which she is getting through by reading the Bible and finding humor in her thoughts, she said in her interview with “Let’s Talk with Kat.”  She wishes she could help children who were sexually abused, she told DePasquale. When asked if she could describe her experience in prison in one word, she says: “Growth.”  Before becoming an exotic dancer, she studied psychology at North Carolina Central University. The transition came from her searching for “validation,” she said in the interview.  “I was looking for love and acceptance from people,” she said. “People to love me, to accept me, to pay attention to me for validation. But you can get all of that in Jesus. He loves us just the way we are. That’s what I learned in prison.  “I hurt my brothers and I hope they can forgive me and I want them to know that I love them and they didn’t deserve that and I hope they can forgive me. I hope they can heal.”  The danger of false rape allegations for actual victims  An advocate for victims of sexual assault said rare cases like this might discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and cause people to wrongly doubt them.  “False reports hurt not only the people falsely accused, they hurt every rape victim,” Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, vice president of communications for RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, told CNN. “There are already too many victims who do not report the crime for fear of not being believed. After a false report in such a high-profile case, even more survivors may be reluctant to come forward out of fear that law enforcement will not believe them.”  A study published by Violence Against Women in 2010 found that false sexual assault reports range from between 2 to 10 percent. A majority of sexual assaults, an estimated 63 percent, are never reported to the police, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.  Kaleba said she encourages people to consider the nearly half million victims in the US of rape and sexual assault each year who may now face renewed disbelief and question the value of reporting sexual violence.  “Don’t allow infrequent, false reporting to stand in the way of standing with survivors,” Kaleba said.",US,-0.9993
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor.",US,-0.9676
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/kirstin-lobato-las-vegas-verdict/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Las Vegas jury awards $34 million to woman falsely accused of murder,"Las Vegas AP —  A federal jury in Nevada has awarded more than $34 million to a woman who was arrested at age 18, wrongly convicted twice, and served nearly 16 years in a Nevada state prison for a 2001 killing she did not commit.  Kirstin Lobato, who is now 41 and uses the name Blaise, cried and hugged her attorneys after a judge read the trial verdict Thursday in US District Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  “It’s been an uphill battle with many, many obstacles,” she told reporters. “And I’m happy that it’s all finally finished.”  Lobato said she didn’t know if becoming a millionaire would make up for years in prison, adding that she had “no idea what the rest of my life is going to look like.”  The civil trial jury found Las Vegas police and two detectives, now retired, fabricated evidence during their investigation and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Lobato. The panel determined that Lobato should receive $34 million in compensatory damages from the department and $10,000 in punitive damages from each former detective.  The detectives, Thomas Thowsen and James LaRochelle, and their attorney, Craig Anderson, declined to comment outside court. Anderson told US District Judge Richard Boulware he planned to file additional court documents following the verdict. Anderson said Friday an appeal was “likely.”  The department previously agreed to pay damages if the jury ruled in Lobato’s favor.  Lobato was 18 when she was interviewed by police without an attorney, arrested and charged with killing Duran Bailey in Las Vegas in July 2001. Bailey, who had been homeless, was found dead near a trash bin with a slashed neck, cracked skull and missing genitals.  No physical evidence or witnesses connected Lobato to the killing, and she maintained she never met Bailey. But police maintained she confessed in jail that she had killed a man who tried to rape her during a three-day methamphetamine binge.  Lobato was 19 when she was convicted of murder in 2002. The Nevada Supreme Court threw out that verdict and Lobato’s prison sentence in 2004 because her lawyers weren’t able to cross-examine a prosecution witness who testified that Lobato made the jailhouse confession.  Lobato was tried again in 2006, convicted of manslaughter, mutilation and weapon charges, and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.  She was exonerated and freed from prison in late 2017 after the Innocence Project and attorneys in Las Vegas again took her case to the state Supreme Court. Justices said evidence showed that Lobato was in her hometown of Panaca, Nevada, some 150 miles from Las Vegas when Bailey was killed.  Last October, a state court judge in Las Vegas issued a certificate declaring Lobato innocent of Bailey’s killing.  That action was challenged by Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson in a letter asking state Attorney General Aaron Ford to investigate how and why attorneys for Lobato acquired the certificate of innocence.  Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled Kirstin Lobato’s first name.",US,-0.9948
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/baby-garnet-cold-case-michigan/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Baby Garnet cold case update: A DNA test helped solve a 1997 Michigan murder,"CNN —  It was the middle of Jenna Gerwatowski’s workday at the local flower shop in Newberry, Michigan, when she got a call from an unknown number.  The now 23-year-old doesn’t usually answer unknown calls, but says she decided to pick this one up in May 2022.  To her surprise, it was a detective from the Michigan state police.  “He was like, ‘Have you heard of the Baby Garnet case?’” Jenna told CNN.  Jenna had heard of it. In 1997, a deceased infant was found in a campground pit toilet at the Garnet Lake Campground – right where Jenna grew up. Investigators couldn’t find any leads on the identity of the baby or anyone who witnessed a person abandoning an infant, according to a news release from the Michigan attorney general’s office. The case went cold, and the “Baby Garnet” case became a known murder mystery in Jenna’s small town for decades.  “Your DNA was a match,” Jenna says the detective on the phone told her. She was related to the dead infant from 1997.  Jenna was in shock. The detective sounded sure, Jenna said, but she wondered how he had even obtained her DNA.  About six months earlier, her friend had gotten a FamilyTreeDNA test for Christmas and Jenna decided to order her own. DNA from other Baby Garnet relatives led detectives to Jenna’s FamilyTreeDNA kit, according to court documents.  Jenna Gerwatowski, left, says the case was always a big mystery in her town. She had no idea the grandmother she'd never met, Nancy Gerwatowski, right, could be behind it. Jenna Rose Gerwatowski/Mackinac County Sheriff's Office  The detective said a woman from Identifinders International, a genetic genealogy investigation firm, would call her about her DNA to help with identifying closer relatives, according to Jenna.  According to court documents, detectives reopened the cold case in 2017 and then worked with a forensics company to extract DNA from Baby Garnet’s partial femur, before sending the results to Identifinders International.  Jenna explained the situation to her mother when she got home from work.  “It was just crazy,” Jenna said. “We were both sitting there like, I don’t even know who (the mother or father) could’ve been. We were both so confused and we’re like, it’s got to be somebody that we don’t know, you know, like a distant cousin or something.”  Jenna said her mother, Kara Gerwatowski, started to wonder whether the detective call was a scam.  Jenna’s grandfather had just been scammed by someone claiming to be a detective, so Kara told Jenna to be cautious about giving out personal information or passwords.  Misty Gillis, then a senior forensic genealogist and cold case liaison from Identifinders International, called Jenna that night, according to Jenna and court documents filed later in the case.  Jenna claims Gillis requested her FamilyTreeDNA password to be able to upload her DNA into a separate database. Jenna was concerned it was a scammer and refused to cooperate, according to court documents.  “I hung up the phone on her, not even thinking twice about it. And we went about our day. I was like, how weird. What a weird thing to scam people about,” Jenna said. “I wholeheartedly did not think that it was real.”  One week later, Jenna was working at the flower shop when she got a distressed call from her mother.  “She was like, ‘I really need you to come home. … It’s an emergency. Like, just please come as soon as you can,’” Jenna said.  Jenna rushed home thinking someone died. Her cousin was sitting with her mom at their round wooden kitchen table. Police had contacted her cousin, who works as a victim’s advocate in the county prosecutor’s office, to explain the Baby Garnet situation to Jenna. It turned out it wasn’t a scam.  “My mom had tears in her eyes,” she said. Jenna’s cousin had “just pure shock on her face. … You could hear a pin drop in there.”  Even though Jenna knew she had nothing to do with the Baby Garnet case, she was terrified police would think she was trying to hide something because of her refusal to speak with Gillis. She immediately called her.  An analysis of Jenna’s DNA kit showed she was the half-niece to Baby Garnet, according to court records.  On June 1, 2022, detectives spoke with her mother, Kara, who agreed to provide her DNA. Kara was the half-sister of Baby Garnet, according to court records.  “I feel like that is when, like, all of the puzzle pieces kind of started falling together for her,” Jenna said. “And she told detectives that, if it’s going to be anybody, it would be (her) mother.”  Kara, now 42, had not spoken with her mother, Nancy Gerwatowski, since she was 18 because they had a bad relationship, and Jenna had never met her grandmother. Regardless, both were shocked Nancy, who was living in Wyoming when police questioned her, would be the one behind their town mystery.  “I had grown up knowing about the case my whole life and then come to find out it was my grandma that did it?” Jenna said.  The Michigan attorney general’s office alleges Nancy “delivered the newborn alone at her Newberry home, during which Baby Garnet died due to asphyxiation, and that this death could have been prevented by medical intervention (Nancy) Gerwatowski did not seek.”  However, in a court filing, Nancy’s defense argues she unexpectedly gave birth while in the bathtub and the fetus “became trapped inside her birth canal.” She “attempted to pull the fetus out of her own body,” the filing says, but couldn’t deliver the fetus and lost consciousness “at some point in the delivery.” When she was finally able to deliver the fetus, it was dead, the filing says.  Her defense argues that Nancy, like the average person in the county in 1997, did not have access to a telephone or cell line, so she couldn’t call 911. While she concedes in her legal filings she placed the stillborn fetus in a bag and left the remains at the campground, her defense attorneys argue she had been in shock after having had no pain medication during the traumatic birth.  Nancy is charged with one count each of open murder, involuntary manslaughter, and concealing the death of an individual. Open murder carries a potential life sentence.  In a hearing on Thursday, Nancy’s defense argued that the case against her should be dropped in its entirety because the state cannot prove the baby was born alive. If the court allows the case to proceed, the defense argued, Nancy’s statements during police interrogation should be excluded because she was denied her right to counsel — a contention the state disputed. If the court does allow her statements to be a part of the trial, Nancy’s lawyers want her comments about considering an abortion and not seeking out prenatal care to be excluded, while the state argued the comments are relevant to possible motive.  Judge Brian D. Rahilly said he hopes to reach a decision on whether or not to drop the charges by next week or around the end of the year at the latest.  “It was a very hard time … very traumatizing and very nerve-wracking,” said Jenna. “I’ve never met this woman, so it was hard for me to even grasp that concept, but even harder for my mom because that was her mother.”",US,-0.9991
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-thursday-hnk/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,UnitedHealthCare CEO shooting: Suspect Luigi Mangione now faces mounting evidence,"CNN —  Marked shell casings from the assassination scene match the gun found on the suspect. His fingerprints match some key items investigators found nearby. And he was arrested this week – after going silent from his mom and friends for months – with a fake ID and a handwritten “claim of responsibility” referencing the crime site.  These details and others, shared by law enforcement and people who know suspect Luigi Mangione, have been mounting since last week’s daylight killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a busy sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of the investigation into Thompson’s killing, sources tell CNN.  A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN at least two of the warrants include the backpack found in Central Park and the burner phone found along the getaway route police believe Mangione took from the shooting scene. Investigators also searched the hostel where suspected killer Mangione stayed the night before the shooting and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  After a five-day, multi-state manhunt that leaned heavily on surveillance images and pleas for the public’s help, Mangione, 26, is now charged in the case with murder after a tip led to his arrest Monday at a McDonald’s nearly 200 miles from where the brazen homicide unfolded.  Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury in the case against Mangione, sources told ABC News.  Mangione was charged in a felony arrest warrant earlier this week. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  Blair County Judge David Consiglio scheduled a hearing in Pennsylvania on December 30 in response to Mangione’s petitions for writ of habeas corpus and imposition of bail, court documents from Thursday show.  Mangione was denied bail on Tuesday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania. The habeas corpus petition is a key factor in whether the suspect can be extradited to New York.  Mangione’s team was given two weeks from Tuesday to file the habeas corpus petition, which challenges Pennsylvania’s ability to prove that Mangione is the person the state of New York has issued the arrest warrant for, according to Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.  Mangione is also set to appear in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, court on December 23 for a preliminary hearing related to state charges.  Mangione’s lawyer has denied his client’s involvement in the December 4 killing and anticipates he will plead not guilty to the murder and other charges in New York, as well as to charges related to the 3D-printed gun and fake ID in Pennsylvania, where he was caught and is being held without bond.  Defense attorney Thomas Dickey on Wednesday also dismissed the ballistics and fingerprint evidence revealed publicly hours earlier, saying he wants to examine it himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”  Thomas Dickey, attorney for suspected shooter Luigi Mangione, speaks Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “As lawyers, we need to see it. We need to see: How did they collect it? How much of it? And then we would have our experts … take a look at that, and then we would challenge its admissibility and challenge the accuracy of those results.”  Still, New York’s governor expects a murder indictment “to be issued any day now, and the second that happens, I’m issuing a warrant for extradition.”  “It feels like the evidence is very compelling,” Gov. Kathy Hochul told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. “I trust the DA here in Manhattan to make sure that he puts forth an indictment that is going to be iron-clad.”  Meanwhile, Hochul is unimpressed by the folk hero status Mangione has attained on social media as the killing of Thompson – a husband and father of two – has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry.  Mangione appears to have been driven by anger against the industry and “corporate greed” as a whole, states a New York Police Department intelligence report that also warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  “That horrific attack occurred on our streets,” Hochul said Thursday. “And the people of our city deserve to have that sense of calm that this perpetrator has been caught, and he will be never seeing the late of day again if there is justice.”  “You cannot assassinate an individual on the streets of New York – not now, not ever.”  Neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said on Thursday.  Suspect hadn’t spoken to mother since July  Until he was found Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Mangione had gone quiet from at least a few people who appear to have been close with him. The scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, he had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  Mangione’s mother had reported him missing November 18 – two weeks before Thompson’s killing – a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. She called police in San Francisco, where she knew her son had been living, and told authorities she’d called his phone repeatedly to find the voicemail full and not taking any more messages.  Mangione’s mom had no reason to believe her son was a danger to himself or others, she told the San Francisco Police Department, but she hadn’t actually spoken with him since July 1, the official said. He had worked remotely at TrueCar, she also said, where the phone was disconnected and the offices closed, the official added.  It also doesn’t appear Mangione had posted anything since midsummer to social media, where posts addressed to his X account suggest some of his friends have been trying to get in touch with him.  In July, a user tweeted at Mangione, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding. In late November, just weeks before the shooting, another user posted at Mangione, “thinking of you and prayers everyday in your name. Know you are missed and loved.”  As Mangione entered a Pennsylvania courthouse this week, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, he yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Suspected shooter Luigi Mangione is led from the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “He’s irritated, agitated about what’s happening to him and what he’s being accused of,” Dickey told CNN of Mangione’s outburst and struggle with police.  “He never had any legal representation until he walked into that building yesterday. And I talked to him … look at the difference between when he went in and when he came out … now he has a spokesperson and someone that’s going to fight for him.”  Suspect linked to fingerprints and gun  Police in New York on Wednesday publicly revealed the first positive forensic match and direct physical evidence tying Mangione to Thompson’s killing, law enforcement officials told CNN.  “We got the gun in question back from Pennsylvania. It’s now at the NYPD crime lab,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “We were able to match that gun to the three shell casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of the homicide.”  A 3D-printed gun was in Mangione’s possession when he was arrested Monday, police have said.  The three 9 mm shell casings had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, one word per bullet, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Police have been looking into whether those words, which match the title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry, may point to a motive in the killing.  Authorities also had been probing DNA material and a partial fingerprint from a discarded Starbucks water bottle and an energy bar wrapper surveillance images showed the suspect buying about 30 minutes before the shooting. Mangione’s fingerprints were confirmed as a match, Tisch said  Along with the prints and ballistics, investigators have been examining writings police have said Mangione had upon arrest, including a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility.” It did not include specific threats but indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday.  In some writings, he referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny added. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  Investigators also are looking at the suspect’s writing in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.  It included to-do lists to facilitate a killing, as well as notes justifying those plans, the source said. In one notebook passage, Mangione wrote about the late Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber who justified a deadly bombing campaign as an effort to protect against the onslaught of technology and exploitation. Mangione had written about the Unabomber in online posts as well.  In a notebook passage, Mangione concludes using a bomb against his intended victim “could kill innocents” and shooting would be more targeted, musing what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/hannah-kobayashi-found-update-father/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,"Hannah Kobayashi ‘has been found safe,’ family reports after police declared her a voluntary missing person","CNN —  Hannah Kobayashi “has been found safe,” her family said Wednesday, more than a week after police declared her voluntarily missing amid fears she may have been abducted.  “We are incredibly relieved and grateful that Hannah has been found safe,” Kobayashi’s sister, Sydni, and mother, Brandi Yee, said. “This past month has been an unimaginable ordeal for our family, and we kindly ask for privacy as we take the time to heal and process everything we have been through.”  The statement was posted on X by the family’s lawyer, Sara Azari. The statement did not indicate where Kobayashi was or how the family determined she was safe.  The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement they are “happy to learn that Hannah has been found safe” and due to the new information “this has become a private matter and we will wrap up our investigation.”  The family had launched a GoFundMe that raised over $47,000 to help find Hannah. Donations have been turned off, and donors who would like a refund can submit a claim, the family said.  Hannah Kobayashi arrived at Los Angeles International Airport from Maui on November 8, but did not board her connecting flight to New York, her sister previously told CNN. The family last heard from the 30-year-old on November 11 after spending four days in Los Angeles at various locations, according to video footage and photos.

She was declared a missing person on November 15.  More than three weeks after she left Maui, Los Angeles police declared her as a voluntary missing person on December 2. Video surveillance from US Customs and Border Protection “clearly shows” Hannah Kobayashi crossing the US-Mexico border just after noon on November 12 at the San Ysidro port of entry, police said.  “To date the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a news conference. “She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her.”  Volunteers put up flyers of missing Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi outside Crypto.com Arena in Downtown Los Angeles. Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images/File  Before leaving Maui, investigators found Hannah Kobayashi had expressed a desire to disconnect from modern technology, police said.  Tragedy struck the family during their search for Hannah Kobayashi when her father Ryan Kobayashi, who had traveled from Hawaii to Los Angeles to help look for her, was found dead November 24 near the airport, having taken his own life, the family and authorities say.  Hannah Kobayashi’s aunt, Larie Pidgeon, told CNN that he “died of a broken heart.”  This story has been updated with additional information.",US,-0.8042

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/louisville-police-reform-breonna-taylor/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,"DOJ, Louisville reach deal after probe prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor","Louisville, Kentucky AP —  The US Justice Department and the city of Louisville have reached an agreement to reform the city’s police force after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, officials said Thursday.  The consent decree, which must be approved by a judge, follows a federal investigation that found Louisville police have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the “historic content decree” will build upon and accelerate, this transformational police reform we have already begun in Louisville.” He noted that “significant improvements” have already been implemented since Taylor’s death in March 2020. That includes a city law banning the use of “no-knock” warrants.  The Justice Department report released in March 2023 said the Louisville police department “discriminates against Black people in its enforcement activities,” uses excessive force and conducts searches based on invalid warrants. It also said the department violates the rights of people engaged in protests.  “This conduct harmed community members and undermined public trust in law enforcement that is essential for public safety,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This consent decree marks a new day for Louisville.”  Once the consent decree is agreed upon, a federal officer will monitor the progress made by the city.  The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened 12 civil rights investigations into law enforcement agencies, but this is the first that has reached a consent decree. The Justice Department and the city of Springfield, Massachusetts announced an agreement in 2022 but the investigation into that police department was opened under President Donald Trump’s first administration.  City officials in Memphis have taken a different approach, pushing against the need for a Justice Department consent decree to enact reforms in light of a federal investigation launched after Tyre Nichols’ killing that found Memphis officers routinely use unwarranted force and disproportionately target Black people. Memphis officials have not ruled eventually agreeing to a consent decree, but have said the city can make changes more effectively without committing to a binding pact.  It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department’s priorities around civil rights.",US,0.9902
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,New Jersey drones: Lawmakers meet with security officials after weeks of unexplained sightings,"CNN —  Weeks of mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey are prompting heightened security concerns – and mounting frustrations – from residents, military personnel and federal, state and local officials.  While the state’s governor says there’s no threat to public safety, other state officials and local mayors are alarmed.  “I’m legitimately concerned for what the hell is going on because nobody knows,” state Assemblyman Brian Bergen told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey after a briefing at state police headquarters on Wednesday.  “We are literally being invaded by drones. We have no idea who is doing it and where they’re coming from,” Pequannock Mayor Ryan Herb told the station after the briefing.  Law enforcement has not identified the origin or landing sites of the drones, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday. He added that the drones primarily operate at night, often displaying flashing lights, but they turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached.  According to Melham, the drones have eluded radar detection, possibly because they do not emit frequencies or possess evasion capabilities.  He also raised alarm over where some of the drones have been spotted.  “One of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey’s critical infrastructure,” Melham said.  The mayor of West Milford, Michele Dale, reported 60 drones hovering over local reservoirs.  Some members of Congress have speculated that a foreign entity may be involved in the drones, something the Pentagon rebuffed Wednesday.  The denial came hours after US Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, told Fox News the drones were from “a mothership” from Iran that is “off the East Coast of the United States of America.”  “There is not any truth to that,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.”  Meanwhile, US Northern Command, which oversees the Defense Department’s homeland security efforts, said in statement Wednesday that it had “conducted a deliberate analysis of the events” regarding the drone sightings but had not been asked “to assist with these events.”  A spokesperson for the US Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged an encounter by one of its assets with the drones.  “Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  The aircraft were not seen as an immediate threat and did not interfere with operations, Pinneo added.  CNN reached out to the Coast Guard but did not receive an immediate response.  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told WBGO on Wednesday the public should feel secure while acknowledging their fears.  “Based on everything we know, there is no public safety risks we’re aware of,” Murphy said.  “Is it frustrating to have no answers? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes,” the governor told the radio station.  The sightings began November 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. At times, large drones — some up to 6 feet in diameter — were seen nightly in New Jersey from dusk until 11 p.m., with sightings ranging from 4 to 180, according to state lawmakers who attended the briefing Wednesday.  The drones operate in a coordinated manner, turning off their lights to evade detection, complicating tracking efforts. They are not identified as hobbyist drones or linked to the Department of Homeland Security, State Assembly member Dawn Fantasia said on X.  The FBI is leading the investigation with the New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, while the US Coast Guard is assessing jurisdictional responses.  Federal agencies have ruled out any connections of local, state, or federal governments to the sightings.  Melham called for a temporary flight ban on all personnel and commercial drones in his video update, despite official advisories against such measures.  Concerns escalated after drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to military officials and state lawmakers. The sightings prompted the FAA to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.  Unnerved residents have described frequently seeing the drones hovering overhead, sometimes traveling in clusters.  While visiting family in New Jersey, travel content creator Katie Caf initially doubted reports of drones until she spotted several moving in a “zigzagging” pattern on Saturday. The 29-year-old noticed five potential drones, which she described as being the size of a bicycle. “They’re so weird looking and they’re much bigger than normal drones. I get why everyone is freaking out now … I think it’s kinda spooky.”  Fantasia said on X that the briefing occurred Wednesday at the New Jersey State Police headquarters and included descriptions of the aircraft’s movements and federal agencies’ response.  Though Murphy has said there is no known threat to the public, Fantasia and other local leaders have expressed doubt and are demanding more transparency into the investigation.  US Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, pushed for more information from federal investigators in a letter sent Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  “I recognize the need to maintain operational security of ongoing investigations and that this situation requires complex interagency coordination,” Booker wrote. “However, there is a growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state – from constituents and local officials alike – despite assurances that the drones pose no known threats to public safety.”  The FBI in Newark has asked the public to report any information related to the drones, including in several areas along the Raritan River.  “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI field office in Newark said December 3.  During a US Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday, Robert Wheeler, assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, called the phenomenon “concerning” but said “there is nothing that is known” that would lead him to identify a public safety risk.  CNN has sought more information from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and New Jersey State Police.  This story has been updated with additional information.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/university-of-mississippi-student-killing-mistrial/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee: Judge declares mistrial after jury deadlocks over killing of gay University of Mississippi student,"AP —  A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the case of Sheldon “Timothy” Herrington Jr. in the 2022 killing of Jimmie “Jay” Lee, a gay man who was prominent in the LGBTQ+ community at the University of Mississippi.  Jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict after over nine and a half hours of deliberation.  Lee’s body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead.  Herrington, 24, showed little emotion as he left the courtroom with his attorneys and several relatives. He remains free on bond and is still charged with capital murder, which Mississippi law defines as a killing committed along with another felony — in this case, kidnapping. Prosecutors had said they would not seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison if he is tried again and convicted.  Jurors on Wednesday were told they could also consider lesser charges of first-degree murder, punishable by life in prison; second-degree murder, 20 years to life; or manslaughter, up to 20 years.  University of Mississippi student Jimmie ""Jay"" Lee is seen in this undated image. Oxford Police Police Department  Circuit Judge Kelly Luther said he will consult with prosecutors and defense attorneys about setting another trial.  Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee, 20, was pursuing a master’s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.  Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, where the university is located and the trial was held.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee vanished. Investigators testified that they used warrants to obtain electronic records including explicit messages between social media accounts belonging to the two men and online searches conducted by Herrington, including one inquiring how long it takes to strangle someone.  Prosecutors said during closing arguments Wednesday that Herrington and Lee had a sexual encounter that ended badly and Lee left Herrington’s apartment. They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex. Prosecutors said Lee was killed after going back.  “Tim Herrington lived a lie — lived a lie to his family,” District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. “He lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.”  Herrington’s attorney, Kevin Horan, has said prosecutors cannot prove Lee is dead without having a body. He told jurors Wednesday that text messages showed Herrington did not lure Lee to his apartment.  Judge Kelly Luther presides over the case of Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr. at the Lafayette County Courthouse in Oxford, Mississippi, on Wednesday. Bruce Newman/Pool/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal/AP  “He’s the one that’s being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,” Horan said of Lee.  Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.  Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained explicit messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.  Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched “how long does it take to strangle someone” at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.  The final text message from Lee’s phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington’s apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee’s phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee’s car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.  On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.  Herrington’s relatives sat behind him in the courtroom, and Lee’s sat behind prosecutors. When Luther dismissed court after the mistrial, he instructed the two groups to leave separately.  Jurors were chosen from another county about 250 miles to the south. They heard eight days of arguments and testimony.  The judge twice urged jurors to continue deliberating when they said they were deadlocked. After the third such message, Luther declared the mistrial and thanked them for serving, adding: “I’ve asked a lot of you.”",US,-0.9977
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/us/timeline-luigi-magione-ceo-shooting/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Timeline: Before and after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s killing,"CNN —  As investigators work to piece together the possible motive and movements of 26-year-old Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione, suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, here’s what we know.  This timeline is based on information from law enforcement sources, official police releases, surveillance images and social media records.  Summer of 2024  Mangione had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  During the summer, Mangione appears to stop posting online, prompting worried messages from some of his friends.  In July, one user posts on X, tagging Mangione, saying, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding.  Mid-November  Mangione’s mother reports her son missing in San Francisco, law enforcement officials said.  Sunday, November 24  10:11 p.m. – Mangione arrives in New York at the Port Authority bus terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue via a bus that originated in Atlanta, then gets into a cab that takes him to the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, where he stays about half an hour.  There was an interaction while the suspect was checking in at the hostel, making casual conversation. ""At some point, he pulled his mask down and smiled at the at the clerk,"" said Joseph Kenny, NYPD chief of detectives. NYPD  11 p.m. – He takes another cab to a hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave. on the Upper West Side, identified as HI New York City Hostel in charging documents.  11:20 p.m. - Surveillance footage from the hostel shows him checking in and showing a driver’s license, according to the arrest warrant in the case. Records from the hostel show he provided a New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario on it, the warrant says.  Friday, November 29  Mangione checks out of the hostel.  “It’s not your traditional check in, check out. It’s the kind of thing where if you don’t show up at a certain time, they automatically just check you out,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. “We don’t believe that he went someplace else. It’s more of an administrative checkout.”  Saturday, November 30  Mangione checks back into the hostel.  Wednesday, December 4  5:34 a.m. – Surveillance footage reviewed by law enforcement shows Mangione leaving the hostel, possibly by bike.  5:41 a.m. – He is seen wandering around the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown, on Sixth Avenue between West 53rd and 54th Streets, and goes back and forth for a bit before heading toward a Starbucks.  “We have him wandering around, walking in the vicinity of hotel, walking on 54th Street, walking back and forth,” Kenny said.  Around 6:17 a.m. – Images from Starbucks show him buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, according to a law enforcement official.  Image of the suspect at a Starbucks on Sixth Avenue. NYPD  6:19 a.m. – Surveillance video near a deli on West 55th Street appears to show him walking and briefly stopping by a pile of trash.  Gideon Platt, Stage Star Deli  6:30 a.m. – Around 6:30 a.m., surveillance video captures what appears to be the gunman on the phone.  Patrick Laborde  6:44 a.m. – Thompson, the victim, walks toward the Hilton after leaving his hotel across the street, police said.  The masked gunman is “lying in wait” outside the hotel as Thompson makes his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.  The gunman comes up behind Thompson and shoots him in the back, Kenny said. He then walks toward Thompson and continues to shoot, stopping to clear a gun jam before firing again.  Obtained by CNN  Investigators told CNN that after the shooting, the assailant crosses the street from the Hilton, flees northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street, and gets on an electric bike on 55th Street before heading north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.  Obtained by CNN  6:48 a.m. – Mangione is seen riding an electric bike into Central Park at 60th Street, according to Kenny.  NYPD  6:56 a.m. – He rides out of the park.  6:58 a.m. - He is seen on the bike at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue.  7:00 a.m. - He is no longer on the bike and is heading northbound on 86th Street.  7:04 a.m. - Mangione gets into a cab.  7:30 a.m. – He is seen near the George Washington Bridge and a Port Authority bus station off 178th Street.  Video shows the suspect entering the bus station.  “We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” Kenny said.  5-Day Manhunt  The suspect was in Pennsylvania for “several days” after the shooting in Manhattan, according to Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police.  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the suspect traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in Altoona, where he is arrested.  Monday, December 9  In a new post on social media, Pennsylvania State Police shared new images of Luigi Mangione sitting inside the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was captured on Monday. The images show Mangione eating what appears to be a hash brown inside the establishment. Pennsylvania State Police  9:14 a.m. - Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania are dispatched to a McDonald’s restaurant, after an employee tipped off police about someone resembling photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police.  9:58 a.m. - Mangione is taken into custody at the McDonald’s, where he presented police with a forged New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario as his identification – the same ID he presented at the hostel, according to the arrest warrant.  Mangione was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea in his first court appearance in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, later that day.  Mangione has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a firearm, according to charging documents released by New York prosecutors.",US,-0.9823

Ryan Borgwardt, 45, was booked into the Green Lake County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system, a service that provides information to crime victims such as a person’s jail custody status. No charges were listed.  The Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday in a social media post that a news conference would be held Wednesday morning to update the Borgwardt case. The post said no further information would be provided until then.  A person answering the phone at the sheriff’s office Tuesday night declined to confirm whether Borgwardt was in custody. County jail officials didn’t immediately return a phone message Tuesday night.  Last month, Sheriff Mark Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on November 11 after disappearing for three months but that he hadn’t committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were “pulling at his heartstrings” to come home. He suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance.  Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of “personal matters,” the sheriff said. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it’s the deepest in Wisconsin.  After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane.  The sheriff said at the time that investigators were working to verify Borgwardt’s description of what happened.  The sheriff’s office has said the search for Borgwardt’s body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn’t expect the search to last more than two weeks.",US,-0.9398

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-abc-news-defamation-lawsuit-settle/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,ABC News settles defamation suit with Trump for $15 million,"CNN —  ABC News will pay $15 million to a “presidential foundation and museum” in a settlement reached with President-elect Donald Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.  The settlement, which was filed publicly Saturday, reveals the network will also pay $1 million in Trump’s attorneys’ fees and will issue an apology.  ABC News will issue the following statement as an editor’s note on the online article at the center of the suit: “ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J. Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC’s This Week on March 10, 2024.”  “We are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,” an ABC News spokesperson wrote in a statement.  Trump filed the lawsuit in Florida federal court earlier this year, arguing that Stephanopoulos and ABC News defamed him when the anchor said 10 times during a contentious on-air interview with South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace in March that a jury found Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll.  Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and that he defamed her when he denied her claim. Trump has denied all wrongdoing toward Carroll.  In 2023, a jury found that Trump sexually abused Carroll, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, though it did not find that Carroll proved he raped her. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million for battery and defamation. In January, Carroll was awarded an additional $83.3 million in damages for defamatory statements made by Trump that disparaged her and denied her rape allegations.  A judge concluded in August 2023, when dismissing Trump’s countersuit against Carroll, that the claim Trump raped Carroll was “substantially true.” The judge wrote that Trump “raped” her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.  In the lawsuit filed against ABC News in March, Trump claimed that Stephanopoulos’ statements were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.”  A judge in July refused to dismiss Trump’s lawsuit against the network, writing that these definitions were different enough. He added that the case would turn on “whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury’s verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.”  The settlement came a day after a federal judge ruled that Trump and Stephanopoulos must sit for a deposition sometime next week. The president-elect can now avoid testifying under oath, which could have come with potential legal risks as he prepares to return to the White House.  Trump has a history of filing lawsuits against the news media. In late October, he filed a lawsuit against CBS, demanding $10 billion in damages over the network’s “60 Minutes” interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. His legal counsel claimed the interview with Harris and the associated programming were “partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference” intended to “mislead the public and attempt to tip the scales” of the presidential election in her favor.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-administration-big-donors/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Big donors secure big roles in the incoming Trump administration,"CNN —  Nearly three dozen of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks to serve in his incoming administration donated to his campaign or to the deep-pocketed outside groups that worked to elect him, a CNN analysis of federal campaign records shows.  They range from tech multibillionaire Elon Musk – who has emerged as the single largest, disclosed political donor of the 2024 presidential election – to others close to Trump tapped for key roles throughout government.  In all, eight of his Cabinet picks – led by Linda McMahon, the billionaire wrestling magnate Trump has selected to oversee the Education Department – and their spouses donated more than $37 million combined from their personal accounts to aid Trump, the review found, underscoring the proliferation of ultra-rich Americans now poised to shape US policy in the incoming second Trump administration.  (Two other Cabinet choices, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, transferred money from their campaign accounts to the pro-Trump effort.)  Musk has not been selected for a formal Cabinet job but is helping guide a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative and has played a pivotal role in the presidential transition – offering his views on job candidates, talking to world leaders and meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as he weighs how to downsize the federal government.  In all, the SpaceX and Tesla chief executive donated more than $277 million to federal elections this cycle, the lion’s share of which – more than $262 million – benefited Trump. Most of Musk’s pro-Trump dollars flowed to a super PAC that the world’s richest man created to help turn out voters on the Republican’s behalf in key swing states.  Outside of self-funded presidential candidates, no individual has donated more to shape federal contests in a single election cycle, said Brendan Glavin, research director of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes money in politics.  Trump’s donors “are not just getting these sort of plum ambassadorships on the side,” Glavin said. “Major donors are getting positions that affect policy.”  The CNN analysis researched the more than 90 people that Trump had announced for high-level positions in the administration through Tuesday, which marked five weeks since his election victory. More than 30 of them had donated to his campaign or to one of the leading Trump-aligned outside groups, the review of FEC records found.  “Millions of Americans fed up with failure in the White House and federal government joined President Trump in the movement to restore our nation’s greatness. Some who will work with President Trump are among those millions of people who supported the campaign and helped the President win a decisive electoral victory,” Brian Hughes, a Trump transition team spokesman, said in a statement in response to CNN’s inquiry about donors joining the administration.  The total donations from Trump’s current Cabinet picks marks a surge from Trump’s first term. Five members of his original Cabinet had donated nearly $8 million to his committees or to the major outside groups supporting him, a review of campaign reports shows.  Donations from McMahon, who served as Trump’s SBA administrator in his first White House term, accounted for more than 90% of that total in the 2016 election.  The sums spent to aid Trump in 2024 far exceed the donations that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet members contributed to help him win the White House in 2020, FEC records show.  A dozen members of Biden’s Cabinet reported donations to his campaign or major super PACs involved in the 2020 election, giving less than $100,000 in total.  Billionaires in the administration  Musk’s spending dwarfed that of other supporters.  McMahon was the largest donor among Trump’s Cabinet picks and the second most generous contributor, after Musk, among the administration members announced through Tuesday, the review found.  Most of the $21.2 million she donated went to Make American Great Again, Inc., the main Trump-affiliated super PAC that spent heavily on advertising to aid his campaign.  Other seven-figure donors among Trump’s Cabinet picks include Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick, whom Trump has tapped to serve as Commerce secretary; Scott Bessent, the hedge fund executive Trump has selected to oversee the Treasury Department; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, his choice to head the Small Business Administration.  Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher, also was a major donor, contributing more than $2 million to the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and Trump’s joint fundraising committee.  Sprecher is the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and was at Trump’s side when the president-elect rang the opening bell at the exchange Thursday.  In an email, Loeffler’s communication director Caitlin O’Dea said, “Senator Loeffler is proud to be one of President Trump’s strongest supporters for the same reason a historic landslide of Americans voted to put him back in the White House: he will restore American prosperity, security, and opportunity.”  The billionaire embrace marks a turnaround of sorts for Trump, who saw corporate America recoil from him after the violent January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And he has seen new support from tech leaders who are pushing for fewer regulations from the federal government.  The staggering sums spent by Musk in this year’s election helped Trump close the financial advantage of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who swiftly raised $1 billion after becoming her party’s standard-bearer in late July.  Super PACs face no limit on the size of donations they can receive or spend, but technically are not allowed coordinate their advertising decisions with the candidates they support.  However, a ruling this year by the FEC granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing efforts freed up Musk to guide a ground game for Trump.  “The campaign finance system is a joke,” said Fred Wertheimer, who heads the Democracy 21 watchdog group and is a longtime advocate for limits on money in politics. “Musk is the example now of how campaign finance laws have failed.”  He said he worries about government departments led by billionaires who have no “interest in doing the job that the agency was assigned.”  Musk did not respond to inquiries from CNN.  But Tom Davis, a former congressman from Virginia who chaired the House Republicans’ campaign arm for several years, argues “there is nothing inherently wrong about people who made a lot of money wanting to give back through government.”  “The fact that they have contributed shows a degree of loyalty,” he added.  Friends and family  Presidents often reward donors and allies with plum positions – often dispatching them to glamorous, low-conflict posts in Europe or the Caribbean.  Some of Trump’s early picks for ambassadorships follow that pattern and include billionaires who donated to his reelection effort. Among them: Arkansas investor Warren Stephens, named as the US’ envoy to the UK, and Charles Kushner, Trump’s choice for ambassador to France – one of several extended family members or close friends who has been chosen for diplomatic gigs.  Kushner, who donated $2 million to pro-Trump efforts and received a presidential pardon at the end of Trump’s first term, is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. Another donor, Tom Barrack, who oversaw the fundraising for Trump’s first inauguration, is his choice as ambassador to Turkey.  And incoming special envoy to the Middle East, real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff, is a longtime Trump friend and a partner in the cryptocurrency businesses that Trump launched with his sons earlier this year.  He donated $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC.",US,0.9994
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/antony-blinken-jordan-syria/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,"US has had direct contact with Syrian rebel group, Blinken says","Aqaba, Jordan CNN —  The United States has had direct contact with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Syrian rebel group now in de-facto control of the country, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday.  The first public confirmation of direct interaction with the US-designated terrorist group, known as HTS, came at the conclusion of Blinken’s diplomatic sprint through the region spurred by the sudden collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  “Yes, we’ve been in contact with HTS and the other parties,” Blinken said at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan. Blinken did not give details on when the contact was made or at what level. There is no legal barrier to speaking with a designated terrorist group.  “We have pressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,” Blinken said, referencing the American journalist who was detained in Syria more than a decade ago. The US has redoubled its efforts to find him in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse.  The US also shared the principles expected of a new Syrian government, including that the rights of all Syrians should be respected, that the country must not become a base for terrorism, that humanitarian aid must be delivered, and that chemical weapons stockpiles should be secured and safely destroyed.  Those principles, circulated by the US in the days after Assad’s shocking ouster, were further agreed upon in a joint statement by the US and a coalition of other countries at an urgent ministerial meeting in Aqaba on Saturday. Blinken said the agreement “sends a unified message to the new interim authority and parties in Syria.”  Ahead of the Saturday ministerial meeting, Blinken met with key partners in Jordan, Turkey and Iraq to garner consensus around the principles.  “America and our partners have an important stake in helping the Syrian people chart this new path,” the top US diplomat said Saturday. “We know what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders — from mass displacement to terrorism.”  “We can’t underestimate the challenges of this moment and the weeks and months ahead,” he added.  Throughout his trip, Blinken sought to emphasize those stakes. Moving forward, the dynamics on the ground in the region could present significant complications, despite a consensus on the principles.  There was an intense spate of fighting in recent weeks in northern Syria between Turkish-backed forces and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which the US sees as a key partner in the fight to keep ISIS degraded.  A fragile truce between the two sides in Manbij appears to be holding, but the fighting forced the SDF to halt its anti-ISIS operations, according to its top commander.  “This is a moment of vulnerability in which ISIS will seek to regroup, taking the advantage of transition in Syria,” Blinken said Saturday, reemphasizing the importance of the SDF.  In meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Ankara, Blinken warned the US does not want to see any party take actions that would allow ISIS to regroup, including by distracting the SDF from its mission to keep the terrorist group degraded and its fighters imprisoned, a US official said. Blinken also emphasized that nobody should take actions that could jeopardize factions in Syria from potentially coming together in a unified government.  In Baghdad, Blinken asked Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to crack down on the powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and to prevent Iran from transiting weapons through Iraq to Shia militias in Syria, the US official said. Such militias have targeted US personnel and interests in the past.  The response to Israel’s actions in Syria has also emerged as point of division between the US and its Arab partners.  Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has pummeled Syria with strikes and sent Israeli troops to — and beyond — a “buffer zone” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria, in what the United Nations said would be a violation of a 1974 agreement. Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Qatar have condemned Israel’s seizure of the buffer zone, calling it an attempted land grab.  The US, however, has not condemned the move, with Blinken saying that they are talking with the Israeli government.  “The stated purpose of those actions from the Israelis is to try to make sure that equipment that’s been abandoned — military equipment that’s been abandoned by the Syrian army — doesn’t fall into the wrong hands: terrorists, extremists, etc.,” he said Thursday. “But … we’re already talking with Israel; we’re all talking to others about the way ahead.”  A US official said Friday that Blinken intends to make clear to his Arab counterparts that Israel told the US that the incursion is temporary — and that the US expects it to be. That policy could change, however, next month when the Trump administration takes office, this official conceded.  This story has been updated with additional information.",US,-0.9886

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-ban-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,TikTok’s ban won’t be delayed. Here’s what you should know,"CNN —  TikTok has plans for another appeal as it faces a ban on January 19.  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected a temporary pause on the ban of TikTok, calling such a block “unwarranted” and paving the way for the Supreme Court to potentially decide the fate of the popular video-sharing app.  In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that required TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, to be sold to a non-Chinese company. The latest ruling follows last week’s decision by the same appeals court to uphold the law, citing national security concerns.  The Biden administration previously urged the appeals court not to issue a temporary block on the law, arguing that doing so might allow the company to wait months to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, effectively halting the law indefinitely.  “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said on December 6.  What will TikTok’s next appeal look like?  The Supreme Court could make a quick decision on the case. Both TikTok and the federal government previously asked the appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the January 19 ban.  But the Supreme Court, which has a six-justice conservative majority, seems likely to rule in favor of upholding the ban, Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN earlier this month.  “I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” Schiller said.  Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN earlier this month that the Supreme Court may decide not to review the case at all, in which case TikTok is out of luck.  Do you need to delete the app?  Not necessarily.  The Department of Justice said Wednesday that, if the ban takes effect, it would “not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok” for the app’s more than 170 million monthly users. But don’t expect any more updates from the app or the ability to download it, if the ban takes place.  Two leaders of the US House of Representatives’ committee on China sent a bipartisan letter to the CEOs of Apple and Google parent company Alphabet that said they should prepare to remove TikTok from their US app stores on January 19.  TikTok will also be unavailable on internet hosting platforms. The Justice Department warned users can expect the app to “eventually” be unworkable.  Can the ban be avoided?  There’s still some hope that TikTok could remain active in the United States, though ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell it.  The ban’s legislation leaves room for Biden to grant a one-time, 90-day extension if he determines a company has made progress toward a sale. He hasn’t suggested any plans to do so.  President-elect Donald Trump, who begins his term a day after the ban, could be on TikTok’s side. He said in July (in a video posted to the app) that he would “never ban TikTok” — although he did try to ban it during his first term.  There are a few options: Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, though experts say that’s unlikely to be successful. He could also direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month.",US,0.9622
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-shop-ban/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,TikTok Shop was going to be the next big thing. A potential ban could change that,"CNN —  Aakaanksh Autade was iffy on TikTok Shop, TikTok’s in-app shopping feature, when it launched last year. Then the content creator grossed over $100,000 in sales when he hosted a live event on Black Friday and went from skeptic to believer.  Autade is known for sharing tech-related tips and tricks on his TikTok channel, “kaansanity.” He took to TikTok Live for the first time on Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend to promote gadgets like headphones and game consoles. “It was my first time going live, and to make $102,000 in 10 hours was just insane. I didn’t expect it at all,” he said.  Aakaanksh Autade (left) promoted gadgets like the Nintendo Switch via TikTok Live on Cyber Monday. Courtesy Aakaanksh Autade/kaansanity  TikTok Shop allows users to buy and sell products without leaving the app. The sales platform combines entertainment and retail, making it particularly popular among Gen Z buyers, and it continues to grow. It has over 500,000 sellers in the US, including brands like L’Oréal, PacSun and Scrub Daddy.  TikTok Shop raked in $100 million in single-day sales this Black Friday — that’s triple the number from 2023, according to the company. Over Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend alone, the shop saw a 165% increase in shoppers year-over-year, according to a statement by the company this month.  However, a US appeals court this month upheld a law that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 or face a US ban.  That ban could grind the sales platform’s progress to a halt — but creators who spoke to CNN say that they’re sticking with TikTok Shop anyway because they don’t think a ban will actually happen.  “I don’t think TikTok is going anywhere. I think they’re going to figure it out, and there’s so many people invested in TikTok,” Autade said. “It’s hard to ignore how much it means to its users.”  What makes TikTok Shop tick?  TikTok Shop provides a pipeline from discovery to purchase by letting users shop products featured in live videos, pinned on brand and influencer profiles, or tagged in content shown on their algorithm-driven For You page.  Even before the launch of its shopping feature, TikTok had already established a reputation as a place for users to find items to add to their wishlists. A study conducted in 2022 by marketing consulting firm Material Plus found that 61% of users purchased an item after seeing content about it on TikTok, helped by hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which has over 12 million posts.  Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and TikTok creator, said combining passive entertainment with a shopping function can tempt users to open their wallets.  “You’ve got all these people who are spending so much time just being (on TikTok) consuming and creating content,” she said. “When you mix in commerce with our favorite source of entertainment, then we’re going to spend all our money there.”  TikTok Shop’s reliance on user-generated content allows consumers to hear from voices they trust.  Lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk says TikTok Shop's main draw is its ability to let consumers see their favorite influencers use the products they promote in real time. Courtesy Carrie Berk  Social media strategist Keenya Kelly says that TikTok Shop is another avenue for content creators to make money on TikTok without having to leave the app. Courtesy Keenya Kelly  “If you see your favorite creator promoting a product on a live stream or a video, you’re more likely to buy it in that moment,” said Carrie Berk, a lifestyle content creator. The thinking among viewers, she said, is that “if a makeup influencer is promoting a product on TikTok Shop, if she says it’s good, then it must be good.”  TikTok users like Autade also say that the app’s focus on short-form videos gives it an edge over other social media platforms.  “When I click on a product and I can see hundreds or even thousands of people posting a video about that product authentically, that really helps,” he said. “On a different platform, I might just see some words, some reviews, some stars here and there,” but seeing the product in action is different.  Another component of TikTok Shop’s growth is its popularity with younger users. Some 62% of Gen Z consumers say that TikTok is their platform of choice when they need to look something up, beating out search engines like Google, according to a report by marketing technology company SOCi published this year.  “Gen Z as a whole has really chosen TikTok as their premier destination for content,” said Jen Jones, chief marketing officer of e-commerce platform Commercetools. “TikTok shop just seemed like a natural place for those dollars to be spent.”  What would a TikTok ban mean for other social media retail platforms?  Social media shopping is not a new phenomenon.  Ninety-two percent of retailers plan to invest more in social commerce this holiday season, according to a study by Commercetools published in October. The same study showed that Facebook Marketplace was the social commerce platform of choice for businesses, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok Shop and X.  In particular, Jones sees an opportunity for YouTube to fill in the space TikTok could leave behind if a ban comes into force.  She says that YouTube could potentially meet demand for the style of short-form videos popularized by TikTok through YouTube Shorts while capitalizing on its longer-form content.  In the past year alone, people watched over 30 billion hours of shopping-related content on YouTube, the company previously told CNN in an email. In 2023, it launched YouTube Shopping, allowing content creators to tag products from brands featured in their videos and earn commissions.  Experts say that if the TikTok ban happens, it will serve as a lesson for brands to not put all their eggs into one marketing basket.  The Shop tab of the TikTok app is seen on an iPhone on June 23 in Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images  “It’s just really important for companies to have a very diversified strategy when it comes to social shopping,” said Jones. “We know that social shopping is here to stay. You can’t get locked into just one platform.”  Kelly says the same advice applies to individual content creators who make money off their posts and videos, and recommends cultivating a following through more direct forms of outreach like email lists.  “We use social media to reach a group of people,” she said. “You need to pull those people off social media onto email so that you have control over your business.”  Still, Kelly says she sees no reason for content creators to be concerned over the court ruling that moves TikTok one step closer to a ban.  “I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, she said. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.”  Berk commands an audience of almost 4 million followers on TikTok and describes the social media platform as a big part of her livelihood, but she says she’s not worried by the prospect of a total ban next month.  “There has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical,” she said.  Autade still has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, but he told CNN that TikTok was his primary marketing avenue and the platform that has brought him the most success.  Even as the threat of a ban looms nearer, he says it’s still business as usual and plans to continue with a live event in January similar to the one he hosted on Black Friday.  “I’m still all-in on TikTok. I’m still living my day-to-day life, running my businesses, and everything’s pretty much the same until I hear otherwise,” Autade said.",US,0.9961
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked.",US,0.2114
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/sony-stock-record/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Sony hasn’t been this hot since it made the Walkman,"CNN —  The last time Sony was worth this much on the stock market, Bill Clinton was president and the PlayStation 2 was about to debut on American store shelves.  It’s been a rough past two and a half decades for Sony, the 78-year-old company that invented the Walkman and the PlayStation and had long been an icon of consumer electronics. It largely missed the boat on the mobile phone revolution, and while the PlayStation has been profitable, production costs for other electronics have risen while demand has softened.  But as opportunities arise in streaming, Sony is trying to transition from being a legacy consumer electronics company to an original content and entertainment company.  The strategy is working: In the past three years, Sony’s stock (SONY) has started to break out of a decades-long slump. Sony’s stock price in Japan recently closed at the first record high since March 2000, signifying confidence in the company’s ability to evolve its game offerings and steer itself toward entertainment, Damian Thong, a research equity analyst at Macquarie, told CNN.  “If you went back 30 years ago, it was an electronics company, so best known as a seller of hardware,” Thong said. “But today, the company is primarily generating profits off of entertainment, which is games, music and (TV and movies).”  Less hardware, more content  Sony Group, Japan’s third largest company by market value, has turned itself around by innovating its games business beyond consoles and making acquisitions to expand its IP, Joost van Dreunen, an adjunct assistant professor at NYU Stern who teaches the business of video games, told CNN.  Sony acquired Anime powerhouse Crunchyroll in 2021, and it acquired American video game company Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion.  In addition to Sony Interactive Entertainment, which makes the PlayStation, the behemoth Sony Group also includes Sony Pictures, which produces films like the Spider-Man series, and Sony Music, which includes Columbia Records.  Sony is trying to unlock synergy across its subsidiary companies to produce original entertainment content for consumers, van Dreunen said.  Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal in the first season of ""The Last of Us."" Liane Hentscher/HBO  That strategy of leveraging its intellectual property across its brands became apparent at the 75th Emmy Awards in January, when the TV series “The Last of Us” won eight primetime awards. It was the first time a TV show adapted from a videogame earned major consideration at a Hollywood awards ceremony.  It was a momentous occasion for Sony, which first published “The Last of Us” as a videogame in 2013 before it was adapted to become a TV series released in 2023 on HBO and Max. (HBO and Max share ownership with CNN.)  Without a streaming network of its own, licensing its intellectual property and original content is part of Sony’s strategy to compete with streaming giants like Netflix, Disney and Amazon.  Robert Lawson, the chief communications officer for Sony Group, said in a statement that since 2018 when the company acquired EMI publishing, making Sony Music the world’s largest publisher of music, Sony has invested approximately 1.5 trillion yen into content IP across various entertainment businesses.  “Sony Group has shifted its corporate strategies towards strengthening its creation and entertainment assets,” Lawson said, noting the company is focusing on “new collaborations between Sony sister companies,” including leaning heavily into the anime genre.  In the last fiscal year ending March, Sony’s entertainment business, which includes music, movies and games, accounted for 60% of total revenue. That’s double from a decade ago, when the entertainment business accounted for just 30% of total revenue.  A long road to dominance  Doubling down on entertainment represents a departure from Sony’s origins.  Before there was Sony, there was Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, founded in 1946 by Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka. The company released Japan’s first-ever magnetic tape record in 1950. In 1958, the company changed its name to Sony Corporation.  In the 1960s, Sony established its business in the United States. For the next three decades, the Japanese company emerged as a household name in consumer electronics, producing iconic devices from the Trinitron color TV in 1968 to the Walkman cassette player in 1979 to the world’s first CD player in 1982, in addition to numerous cameras and video recorders.  Sony has also been involved with music since the 1960s through a joint venture with CBS that became Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Yet it’s largely been known for its electronics.

Aflo/Shutterstock  The 1990s were a high point for Sony as it broke into the world of gaming consoles. With the release of the PlayStation in 1994, Sony disrupted the arcade and gaming industry.  Since the 1990s, Sony has been a dominant player in the videogame console business with iterations of the PlayStation. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, which has consistently outsold its main competitors like Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Nintendo’s Switch, according to data from Ampere Analysis, an analytics firm for the games business.  Van Dreunen said that Sony is also looking to evolve in gaming beyond its console business, looking for new audiences and methods of distribution.  “We’re currently going through a softer period in gaming, and so it really raises the stakes for companies like, what’s next?” he said. “How do you as the dominant console maker continue to innovate and continue to grow your business?”  An original PlayStation is pictured at a display of various memorabilia in the lobby of the Sony headquarters building in central Tokyo on November 27, 2024.

Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images  Thong said that Sony has been successful in becoming a profitable channel for third-party publishers to sell videogames.  Sony has tried to diversify its strategy toward gaming, including publishing a videogame called Helldivers 2 across PlayStation5 and also PC. Helldivers 2 was a hit for Sony and sold over 12 million copies within three months of its release, according to Anna Kerr, a research manager for games at Ampere Analytics.  “The games business is spreading out its IP,” NYU Stern’s van Dreunen said. “It’s looking for new ways to reach customers, to expand that customer reach.”  In November, Sony announced a 69% percent jump in net quarterly profit, driven in part by its game segment. The company has had consistently strong quarters this year, driven by profitability in its games.  The company is now in talks to acquire Kadokawa, a Japanese videogame powerhouse that produces the popular videogame “Elden Ring,” according to people familiar with the matter.  There have been some headwinds: Sony’s rollout of the “Concord” vieogame and Sony Pictures’ latest installment of the Spider-Man universe were largely flops among fans this year. However, they are trial and error runs, van Dreunen said, and manageable expenditures for a company that has denoted 1.8 trillion yen ($11 billion) for acquisitions and stock buybacks through March 2027.  In May, at Sony’s annual investor conference, Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida said that the company was embracing a “creative entertainment vision.”  Sony’s emergence as an entertainment company was not always certain, Thong said.  “Sony had some years of quite substantial pain, I would say,” Thong said. “And I think to their credit, they managed to weather and see through it.”  Bringing Sony IP to the big screen  Van Dreunen said in the past, there wasn’t as much demand for videogame adaptations for movie and TV. Yet “The Last of Us” showed that Sony had an opportunity to bring more Sony IP to the big screen.  Before “The Last of Us,” Sony also tried its hand at videogame adaptation with “Uncharted,” a 2022 movie featuring actor Tom Holland that was based on a video game franchise first published by Sony in 2007.

Sony is still in the electronics business, Thong said, noting its image sensors business works with companies like Apple and it produces high-end cameras. However, it has shed its identity as a mass consumer electronics company.  In 2025, Sony intends to spin off its online banking and insurance units, further doubling down on its entertainment offerings.  Sony’s stock is up almost 18% in the past month, outpacing entertainment heavyweights like Disney and Netflix, and boosted from investors piling into the Nasdaq, which crossed 20,000 for the first time this week.",US,0.9996
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/business/unitedhealthcare-insurance-denials-change/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,UnitedHealth Group CEO: America’s health system is poorly designed,"CNN —  In his first public response to the consumer outcry following the fatal shooting of one of his top executives, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said Friday that the US health system “is not perfect” and that coverage decisions “are not well understood.”  “We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people’s frustrations with it,” Witty wrote in a guest essay in the New York Times. “No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It’s a patchwork built over decades.”  Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.  “Together with employers, governments and others who pay for care, we need to improve how we explain what insurance covers and how decisions are made,” Witty wrote. “Behind each decision lies a comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety.”  Witty also praised UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was killed in midtown Manhattan last week, writing that Thompson “fought for preventive health and quality health outcomes rather than simply adding ever more tests and procedures.”  In a statement on Friday, UnitedHealthcare said “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company’s treatment of insurance claims” and that it “approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission,” noting that “around one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons.”  Will changes be made?  Thompson’s fatal shooting pushed Americans’ dissatisfaction with their health insurance into the spotlight. Many have made their frustrations abundantly clear on social media.  Journalists have also chronicled insurers’ efforts to twist the system to their benefit. STAT, a news site that focuses on health care, has published a series of investigative stories on UnitedHealth, including articles on how the nation’s largest health insurer uses a computer algorithm to cut off rehabilitation care for Medicare enrollees, limiting clinical case managers’ discretion.  Whether the public outcry prompts UnitedHealthcare and other insurers to adjust their practices — particularly the much-maligned denials of treatment and claims — or pushes lawmakers to force the industry to make changes remains to be seen. It depends, in part, on whether patients continue making their voices heard, experts say.  Angry consumers have had success in overhauling the health insurance industry in the past. They railed against the restrictions of health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, in the 1990s, as captured in the 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” That helped spur insurers to offer more preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, which have fewer constraints but are more costly.  Any shifts in the nation’s complex health care system, however, will not come easily, nor quickly, experts say. There are many players involved, each of which has its own patient care concerns, financial interests and lobbying dollars to influence lawmakers.  UnitedHealthcare’s mission  While many patients and their advocates argue that insurers deny care to pad their profits, the industry maintains that it is protecting consumers from high prices and unnecessary care.  Soon after Thompson’s murder, Witty vowed in an internal message to employees to continue the insurer’s mission of helping “the system improve.”  “Our role is a critical role, and we make sure that care is safe, appropriate, and it’s delivered when people need it,” said Witty in a video message obtained by CNN. “And we guard against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex and ultimately unsustainable. So we’re going to continue to make that case.”  “What we know to be true is that the health system needs a company like UnitedHealth Group,” he continued.  Asked Thursday whether it will make any changes in response to consumers’ public complaints, UnitedHealthcare referred CNN to Witty’s video. Other major insurers either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment, but a leading industry association said that hospitals, providers and employers all have “a direct impact on the cost and accessibility of medical services.”  “In the fragmented and heavily regulated health care system, health plans, providers and drugmakers share a responsibility to make high-quality care as affordable as possible and easier to navigate for the people we collectively serve,” AHIP, the trade group, said in a statement. “Health plans are working to protect patients from the full impact of rising costs while connecting them to care that is safe, evidence-based and coordinated.”  But the recent events may prompt insurers to investigate their practices and make some changes, Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in an email to CNN. This is especially likely if they see risks to their businesses, such as if employers threaten to leave because coverage decisions are too onerous for their workers.  On the flip side, “the main reason to not change their practices is to maintain their profitability while also keeping costs reasonable in a broad sense for their clients and end users,” Utterback wrote.  Video Ad Feedback Scott Galloway says online rage directed at health care CEOs is directed at the wrong people. Hear why. 01:43 - Source: CNN  The HMO backlash  Though former President Bill Clinton failed to reform health care in the early 1990s, his administration’s efforts spurred increased concerns over the cost of care. That cued the growth of the HMO model, which allowed policyholders to see only certain doctors and required referrals from primary care physicians to see specialists and get certain tests and procedures. But HMOs also typically featured low premiums, low or no co-pays and no deductibles.  Policyholders rebelled because they felt they couldn’t access the care they needed, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.  Their angst was captured in extensive media coverage and in the 1997 film “As Good As It Gets,” when a young boy’s mother (played by Helen Hunt) tells a doctor (played by Harold Ramis) that her insurer would not cover an allergy test for her son’s asthma.  “F**king HMO, bastard pieces of sh*t,” Hunt says, before apologizing.  “That’s ok. Actually, I think that’s their technical name,” Ramis replies.  Many states responded to the complaints by passing patients’ bills of rights that limited HMO cost-control practices in state-regulated plans. Employers, who were hearing from angry workers, began shifting to PPOs, which generally provide coverage for a wider range of doctors but have much higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. PPOs have now largely eclipsed the managed care model.  But as health care costs continue to skyrocket, PPOs are instituting practices that resemble those of HMOs, particularly requiring approval of care in advance, known as prior authorization, Levitt said.  “If you think health care costs are rough now, imagine them without constraints,” said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+, a health care consulting group, and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.  Health insurers, however, do at times backtrack when faced with intense blowback. Earlier this month, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield halted its plan to limit the amount of time it would cover anesthesia used in surgeries and procedures after criticism from doctors and politicians. The policy was designed to reduce overbilling and make care more affordable, the insurer had said.  Efforts in Congress  Congress has tried for years to improve access to care and curtail costs, which are far higher in the US than in its peers even though it ranks last on key health measures. Lawmakers have held hearings and introduced bills, but there haven’t been comprehensive reforms enacted since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 — aside from several significant Medicare drug cost provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.  An effort to improve the prior authorization process in Medicare Advantage plans failed to advance in the Senate in 2022 after the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost about $16 billion over a decade.  However, there is now more bipartisan appetite on Capitol Hill to enact reforms, said Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive and vocal critic of the health care industry. Lawmakers reintroduced the prior authorization bill, which now comes with a zero cost estimate, and released a framework to establish so-called site-neutral payments in Medicare, under which Medicare would pay the same rate for a service provided in a hospital outpatient department, an ambulatory surgical center or physician’s office.  Plus, lawmakers are looking at reforms to the pharmacy benefit manager industry, which serves as a middleman between health insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers.  Republicans, who will control Congress starting in January, will be looking for cost savings to offset extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Whitlock said. That could push them to pass measures that would save the government money, such as site-neutral payments.  Meanwhile, the murder of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO will remain in the news as the case against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, winds its way through the court system. That will keep public frustration with health insurers in the spotlight – and could help advance legislation on Capitol Hill, Potter said.  “It will be a years long fight, but it’s going to happen,” he said. “Some kind of reform is inevitable.”",US,0.9982

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/wisconsin-kayaker-ryan-borgwardt-custody/index.html,CNN,left,International,Wisconsin kayaker turned himself in after officials say he faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe,"CNN —  A Wisconsin man who officials say faked his own death and fled to Eastern Europe was charged with a misdemeanor count of obstructing an officer Wednesday after he turned himself in to authorities.  Ryan Borgwardt, who was reported missing in August, flew back to the United States willingly, arriving Tuesday, said Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll, who remained tight-lipped on why the man left his wife and three children by allegedly staging a kayaking accident, and where exactly he’s been for the past four months.  “He came back on his own,” said Podoll during a news conference Wednesday. When asked by the media why Borgwardt decided to return, Podoll added, “His family, I guess.”  Borgwardt’s wife filed a petition for legal separation on Thursday, Dodge County court documents show. In Wisconsin, a legal separation does not end a marriage, unlike a divorce, but allows the court to rule on the same issues that come up in a divorce proceeding.  In her petition, Borgwardt’s wife is requesting sole legal custody of their three teenage children, claiming the 22-year marriage is “irretrievably broken.”  Borgwardt appeared in court Wednesday and said he could not afford an attorney and offered to represent himself. Circuit Court Judge Mark T. Slate reminded the defendant he has the right to a court-appointed attorney and could request one if needed.  Slate entered a not guilty plea on Borgwardt’s behalf and ordered a $500 signature bond. Borgwardt has since bonded out of jail and is expected back in court on January 13, online court records show.  If convicted of the obstruction charge, Borgwardt faces a maximum penalty of a $10,000 fine and nine months in jail, Judge Slate said.  At the request of the prosecutor, Slate did not order but instead requested the media not share images of Borgwardt’s family members. He denied requests for a gag order in the case and for Borgwardt to surrender his passport.  Ryan Borgwardt's booking photo Green Lake County Sheriff  Podoll declined to share details of Borgwardt’s time away or whether he has been in touch with his family. The investigation involved a number of state and federal agencies including the FBI and Homeland Security, he added.  Borgwardt, 45, was reported missing August 12 after failing to return from a fishing trip on Green Lake, about an hour north of his home in Watertown, Wisconsin.  For seven weeks, the Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office searched for Borgwardt’s body with the help of trained volunteers but found only the man’s kayak and a tackle box containing a set of keys, a wallet and his license. Eventually, officials uncovered evidence that Borgwardt had fled to Europe by way of Canada.  Investigators made contact with the father of three on November 11, when they say they learned he executed a plan to fake his own death for a “number of reasons” unknown to the public.  Authorities communicated with Borgwardt almost daily, Podoll said during a news conference in late November, adding that Borgwardt appeared to be safe but had still not spoken to his family.  How Borgwardt ‘disappeared’  On the day he vanished, Borgwardt traveled to Green Lake – one of Wisconsin’s deepest inland lakes – with a plan to fake his own drowning, according to Podoll, who detailed the man’s scheme.  The experienced kayaker paddled out onto the water where he deliberately overturned the vessel, tossed his phone and returned to shore in a child-sized inflatable boat, Podoll said.  Borgwardt then rode an e-bike through the night about 80 miles to Madison, Wisconsin, where he then boarded a bus to Detroit, eventually crossing the Canadian border and flying to Europe, Podoll said.  Before his disappearance, Borgwardt transferred funds to a foreign bank account, changed his email and communicated with a woman in Uzbekistan, according to Podoll. A criminal complaint filed Wednesday said Borgwardt brought approximately $5,500 in cash with him.  Investigators were ultimately able to contact Borgwardt through a Russian-speaking woman, Podoll said, though he declined to say whether she was the woman he had been communicating with in Uzbekistan and whether he was with her.  Borgwardt told police he heavily researched how to disappear by looking up previous cases, and that “everything hinged on me dying in the lake” and the “whole idea was to sell the death,” the complaint said.  In January, Borgwardt took out a $375,000 life insurance policy, which Podoll said was intended to help his family.  “In our communications, we are expressing the importance of his decision to return home and clean up the mess that he has created,” Podoll said. Borgwardt has expressed regret for how he has hurt his family and “also feels bad about the amount of hours that we have put in the community,” the sheriff said.  The long, expansive search for Borgwardt was a costly and emotionally taxing endeavor for both his family and search crews, Podoll said.  Borgwardt’s family has experienced emotional whiplash after mourning him for weeks and then coming to terms with his purported abandonment, the sheriff said on “CNN News Central” last month.  Borgwardt previously told investigators he thought they would stop searching for him after about two weeks, officials said.  “He picked the wrong sheriff and the wrong department,” Podoll said.  The search for Borgwardt  On the morning of August 12, Borgwardt’s capsized kayak was found in the lake and his vehicle and trailer were found at a nearby park, Podoll said.  The following day, two fishermen casting along the lake found a fishing rod that belonged to Borgwardt, his wife told officials. A tackle box was found later that day with several of Borgwardt’s belongings: a set of keys, a wallet and his license.  In October, investigators learned from Canadian officials Borgwardt had entered the country on August 13.  Borgwardt’s passport was found at the family home, but learning he left the country gave investigators a break in the case and prompted them to search his computer and dig deeper, according to Podoll.  Investigators found Borgwardt had replaced the hard drive on his laptop and cleared his browser history on the day of his disappearance, Podoll said. He had also reported his passport stolen and obtained a replacement last spring.  Though the county will seek restitution for the taxpayer-funded search efforts, that does not include the thousands of dollars spent by the non-profit Bruce’s Legacy, which helped in the underwater search for Borgwardt’s body. Borgwardt told police he didn’t realize organizations like that existed, the complaint says.  Keith Cormican, director of Bruce’s Legacy, told CNN he spent nearly 30 days working on the case. The first two weeks of the search alone will cost him about $10,000 due to damaged equipment and other expenses, he said.  “My success rate is pretty good,” Cormican told CNN. “To not be able to find him … really had me questioning my abilities. And I lost a lot of sleep over it.”  CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe and Bill Kirkos contributed to this report.",US,-0.9964
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,International,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process with the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items which may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  FBI: San Francisco police recognized suspect  On Friday, the FBI told CNN they received a tip from the San Francisco Police Department, saying an officer with the department’s Special Victims Unit had recognized Mangione as a possible suspect on December 5 after seeing the surveillance photos of the suspect’s unmasked face.  The San Francisco Chronicle first reported on the tip Thursday.  Chronicle reporter Megan Cassidy told CNN’s John Berman her team reported “a few days ago” on the existence of a missing persons report in San Francisco for Mangione.  “Apparently, there was somebody at SFPD that was looking into the missing persons case, and after the shooting of Brian Thompson, recognized this person and called in this tip, or emailed this tip, to the FBI,” Cassidy said.  The FBI then sent the tip to New York investigators during the manhunt, the agency told CNN.  CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explained on Friday’s “AC360” how the tip ultimately made its way to the FBI in New York and the NYPD.  “This tip comes from, I think, a victim witness specialist in the San Francisco Police Department who had that missing persons case somewhere in front of them and looked at that face and says, ‘Gee, that could be the guy that is on these FBI posters all over town,’ so SFPD sends that to San Francisco FBI,” Miller said.  “San Francisco FBI says, ‘that’s a New York office case,’” he added.  Miller explained the FBI’s New York office likely sent the information to a violent crimes squad composed of a mix of FBI agents and NYPD officers.  “They look at it and they do a workup on the name, checking, you know, any indicators that guy’s been in New York, and then they send it over to NYPD,” Miller said.  By Sunday, the tip joined 200 viable leads being examined by authorities, according to Miller.  “Then Monday morning, at 9:15 in the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, another tip leads to the capture,” he said. “So you see, these leads are piling up, being tasked out and being worked, and this was in that pile coming up because it was a viable lead. It’s just that destiny took a hand quicker.”  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.",US,-0.9995

CNN —  I’m not much of a hugger. Sure, I’ll bust out the warm fuzzies for relatives around the holidays but I’m not like, say, my best friend, who prefers her hugs to produce the bone-liquifying pressure of an industrial vise. My husband loves to tell the story of our first date, when he approached me with open arms and I maneuvered him into a firm, businesslike handshake. Touch is just not my love language! And if you’re also not a hugger, the holidays are a gauntlet of outstretched arms and sweatered bosoms and unfamiliar colognes. We’ll make it through together! I recently watched some interviews with the lead actresses of the new “Wicked” film (which is sooo so good), and each tends to clutch the other’s single beautifully taloned finger when things get deep. I do that too! It is emotionally supportive without being suffocating (literally or figuratively). Fingertip-to-fingertip touching is the new hugging, pass it on.  Here’s all the good things that happened this week.  Nana Kyei  1. The Friendship Queen Diaries  It’s like something out of a movie: Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in 1996. Now, she’s a queen in Ghana. Despite her challenging youth, Johnson made sure she and her daughter were well-traveled, and after discovering she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, she founded a travel company to organize trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Her work attracted the attention of the Dakpema, a governing body in northern Ghana. She was blown away when they asked her to accept the title of “Zosimli Naa,” or “Friendship Queen.” The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the centuries-old Dagbon Kingdom, which comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in the city of Tamale, where she now lives. “We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.  CNN  2. Fabric of rebirth  The iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is finally open to the public again after a devastating fire damaged it five years ago. As part of this rebirth, fashion designer and artist Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was asked to create new vestments, or special service garments, for the cathedral’s clergy. Vestments are an important part of a church’s identity and de Castelbajac said the theme for the new look was “noble simplicity.” The designer drew inspiration from Notre Dame’s stained glass and blonde stone, creating a look that he said speaks to tradition and innovation; old and new. The vision was “radiant with color, radiant of hope, radiant of faith,” de Castelbajac told CNN. You can see details of the vestments in the photo above, and learn more about de Castelbajac’s process in this video.  CNN  3. Music on the brain  If you’ve ever shared your life with someone with dementia or another progressive neurological disease, you know music can be magic. Toronto-based company LUCID is combining facial mapping software, artificial intelligence, and music to create a therapy for older patients dealing with health challenges like Alzheimer’s, dementia and even depression and anxiety. The treatment involves measuring how a person’s brain reacts to music and combining that with facial mapping and artificial intelligence. Using this data, the technology can create specific playlists that hopefully can alleviate stress, restlessness, confusion and emotional discomfort in dementia patients.  Natalia Botero-Acosta  4. I would swim 500 miles  This whale puts The Proclaimers to shame! A male humpback whale has completed an extraordinary record-breaking migration, swimming more than 8,000 miles from South America to Africa. The humpback was first spotted off the coast of Colombia in 2013 and seen again a few years later not far from its original location. But in 2022, the whale was unexpectedly detected in the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa. The typical migration route for humpback whales can approach 5,000 miles in a single direction, making this one’s journey close to two times that of most whales. The discovery also marks the first documentation of an adult male humpback traveling between the Pacific and Indian oceans.

She co-founded the award-winning restaurant Takya, located in the 600-year-old historic center of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. Though the food has all the artfully prepared aura of a high-class restaurant, the menu is inspired by the traditional home cooking Al Motawa grew up with, and by her travels around Saudi Arabia and abroad. After seeing the deep connection between food and culture, Al Motawa wanted to “bring that same connection back home, to create a space where people could rediscover the beauty of Saudi cuisine.” Saudi Arabia itself is a country of great geographical, and thus culinary, diversity. For example, the Eastern Province is known for its seafood, such as Muhammar, a fried fish dish made with rice and sugar that was traditionally popular among sailors. In the country’s northern region, where temperatures are cooler and may drop below freezing during winter, traditional recipes focus on grains and meat, like the popular jareesh, a lamb stew made with wheat and yogurt.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,International,Downtown San Francisco experiences first tornado warning in recorded history,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said. Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and about 300 miles northwest of Sacramento.",US,-0.989
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/crystal-mangum-duke-lacrosse-allegations/index.html,CNN,left,International,Duke lacrosse scandal: Crystal Mangum admits to false rape allegations,"CNN —  More than 18 years after accusing three former Duke University lacrosse players of raping her, a falsified account she shared in graphic detail, Crystal Mangum has admitted she lied about the encounter.  In an interview on a web show published Wednesday, Mangum apologized to the men and said her relationship with God has made her understand why she fabricated the story. Mangum is serving time in prison on a second-degree murder conviction for killing her boyfriend.  The timeline of the North Carolina case begins in 2006, when Mangum said she was trapped inside a bathroom, sexually assaulted and raped by David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann at a team party where she was performing as an exotic dancer. The men were arrested following her allegations.  “I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn’t, and that was wrong. And I betrayed the trust of a lot of other people who believed in me,” Mangum said on Katerena DePasquale’s show, “Let’s Talk with Kat.” “I made up a story that wasn’t true because I wanted validation from people and not from God.”  David Evans, left, Collin Finnerty, center, and Reade Seligmann, right, look on during a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2007. Chuck Burton/AP/File  For more than a year, the school and the lacrosse players were thrust into a media frenzy, subjected to intense public scrutiny and damaging allegations of sexual assault that were ultimately dropped.  After Mangum’s confession, Duke told CNN on Friday it would not comment. The former players did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.  Here’s how the events unfolded.  A timeline of the events  • March 13, 2006: Mangum is hired as a dancer for a private party held by members of the Duke men’s lacrosse team. It takes place at a house on North Buchanan Boulevard in Durham. Mangum later accuses several players of raping her during the party early on March 14.  • March 28, 2006: Duke President Richard Brodhead suspends team play for the men’s lacrosse team, a move widely criticized as premature since no formal charges had been made yet. Media attention intensifies, with early reports painting a picture of privileged, White lacrosse players being accused by a Black woman. The case becomes a flashpoint for issues of race, class and privilege, according to the Washington Post.  • March 28-30, 2006: DNA tests on Mangum’s body fail to link any of the lacrosse players to the scene, according to a disciplinary order against prosecutor Mike Nifong by the North Carolina State Bar, but Nifong insists on moving forward with the case. Skepticism about the case begins to mount.  • April 18, 2006: Nifong formally charges Seligmann and Finnerty with rape, according to the disciplinary order. The charges are based largely on Mangum’s testimony, as forensic evidence was either inconclusive or absent.  • May 15, 2006: Nifong formally charges Evans with rape, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 5, 2006: Duke announces the lacrosse team is reinstated to play in the following fall, but public sentiment has already soured.  • December 28, 2006: Nifong is accused of withholding evidence and making misleading statements to the press, leading to an investigation by the state bar, according to the disciplinary order.  • April 11, 2007: Roy Cooper – then the state’s Attorney General and now its governor – announces “there is insufficient evidence to proceed on any of the charges” in a statement shared by Duke Athletics. The charges are dropped.  “We believe that these cases were the result of a tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations,” Cooper said. “Based on the significant inconsistencies between the evidence and the various accounts given by the accusing witness, we believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges.”  • June 16, 2007: Nifong loses his law license following disciplinary hearings about his handling of the case, including accusations of ethical misconduct and withholding evidence. His disbarment is finalized by the state bar in July, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 18, 2007: Duke announces that it has settled with the three lacrosse players, agreeing to pay a confidential settlement.  “It is impossible to fully describe what we, our families and team endured. As we said from day one, we are innocent,” Evans, Finnerty and Seligmann said in a statement. “But it took three hundred and ninety-four days, and the intervention of the North Carolina Attorney General, before our innocence was formally declared.”  • October 5, 2007: The three players file a civil lawsuit against the city of Durham, Nifong and other individuals, according to court documents. Durham later settles the lawsuit in part with a one-time grant of $50,000 to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.  • April 3, 2011: Mangum is charged with stabbing her boyfriend, leading to a lengthy criminal trial, and is convicted of second-degree murder in 2013.  ‘I hope they can forgive me’  Mangum has spent 11 years in prison, which she is getting through by reading the Bible and finding humor in her thoughts, she said in her interview with “Let’s Talk with Kat.”  She wishes she could help children who were sexually abused, she told DePasquale. When asked if she could describe her experience in prison in one word, she says: “Growth.”  Before becoming an exotic dancer, she studied psychology at North Carolina Central University. The transition came from her searching for “validation,” she said in the interview.  “I was looking for love and acceptance from people,” she said. “People to love me, to accept me, to pay attention to me for validation. But you can get all of that in Jesus. He loves us just the way we are. That’s what I learned in prison.  “I hurt my brothers and I hope they can forgive me and I want them to know that I love them and they didn’t deserve that and I hope they can forgive me. I hope they can heal.”  The danger of false rape allegations for actual victims  An advocate for victims of sexual assault said rare cases like this might discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and cause people to wrongly doubt them.  “False reports hurt not only the people falsely accused, they hurt every rape victim,” Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, vice president of communications for RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, told CNN. “There are already too many victims who do not report the crime for fear of not being believed. After a false report in such a high-profile case, even more survivors may be reluctant to come forward out of fear that law enforcement will not believe them.”  A study published by Violence Against Women in 2010 found that false sexual assault reports range from between 2 to 10 percent. A majority of sexual assaults, an estimated 63 percent, are never reported to the police, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.  Kaleba said she encourages people to consider the nearly half million victims in the US of rape and sexual assault each year who may now face renewed disbelief and question the value of reporting sexual violence.  “Don’t allow infrequent, false reporting to stand in the way of standing with survivors,” Kaleba said.",US,-0.9993
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,International,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor.",US,-0.9676
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/kirstin-lobato-las-vegas-verdict/index.html,CNN,left,International,Las Vegas jury awards $34 million to woman falsely accused of murder,"Las Vegas AP —  A federal jury in Nevada has awarded more than $34 million to a woman who was arrested at age 18, wrongly convicted twice, and served nearly 16 years in a Nevada state prison for a 2001 killing she did not commit.  Kirstin Lobato, who is now 41 and uses the name Blaise, cried and hugged her attorneys after a judge read the trial verdict Thursday in US District Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  “It’s been an uphill battle with many, many obstacles,” she told reporters. “And I’m happy that it’s all finally finished.”  Lobato said she didn’t know if becoming a millionaire would make up for years in prison, adding that she had “no idea what the rest of my life is going to look like.”  The civil trial jury found Las Vegas police and two detectives, now retired, fabricated evidence during their investigation and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Lobato. The panel determined that Lobato should receive $34 million in compensatory damages from the department and $10,000 in punitive damages from each former detective.  The detectives, Thomas Thowsen and James LaRochelle, and their attorney, Craig Anderson, declined to comment outside court. Anderson told US District Judge Richard Boulware he planned to file additional court documents following the verdict. Anderson said Friday an appeal was “likely.”  The department previously agreed to pay damages if the jury ruled in Lobato’s favor.  Lobato was 18 when she was interviewed by police without an attorney, arrested and charged with killing Duran Bailey in Las Vegas in July 2001. Bailey, who had been homeless, was found dead near a trash bin with a slashed neck, cracked skull and missing genitals.  No physical evidence or witnesses connected Lobato to the killing, and she maintained she never met Bailey. But police maintained she confessed in jail that she had killed a man who tried to rape her during a three-day methamphetamine binge.  Lobato was 19 when she was convicted of murder in 2002. The Nevada Supreme Court threw out that verdict and Lobato’s prison sentence in 2004 because her lawyers weren’t able to cross-examine a prosecution witness who testified that Lobato made the jailhouse confession.  Lobato was tried again in 2006, convicted of manslaughter, mutilation and weapon charges, and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.  She was exonerated and freed from prison in late 2017 after the Innocence Project and attorneys in Las Vegas again took her case to the state Supreme Court. Justices said evidence showed that Lobato was in her hometown of Panaca, Nevada, some 150 miles from Las Vegas when Bailey was killed.  Last October, a state court judge in Las Vegas issued a certificate declaring Lobato innocent of Bailey’s killing.  That action was challenged by Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson in a letter asking state Attorney General Aaron Ford to investigate how and why attorneys for Lobato acquired the certificate of innocence.  Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled Kirstin Lobato’s first name.",US,-0.9948
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/baby-garnet-cold-case-michigan/index.html,CNN,left,International,Baby Garnet cold case update: A DNA test helped solve a 1997 Michigan murder,"CNN —  It was the middle of Jenna Gerwatowski’s workday at the local flower shop in Newberry, Michigan, when she got a call from an unknown number.  The now 23-year-old doesn’t usually answer unknown calls, but says she decided to pick this one up in May 2022.  To her surprise, it was a detective from the Michigan state police.  “He was like, ‘Have you heard of the Baby Garnet case?’” Jenna told CNN.  Jenna had heard of it. In 1997, a deceased infant was found in a campground pit toilet at the Garnet Lake Campground – right where Jenna grew up. Investigators couldn’t find any leads on the identity of the baby or anyone who witnessed a person abandoning an infant, according to a news release from the Michigan attorney general’s office. The case went cold, and the “Baby Garnet” case became a known murder mystery in Jenna’s small town for decades.  “Your DNA was a match,” Jenna says the detective on the phone told her. She was related to the dead infant from 1997.  Jenna was in shock. The detective sounded sure, Jenna said, but she wondered how he had even obtained her DNA.  About six months earlier, her friend had gotten a FamilyTreeDNA test for Christmas and Jenna decided to order her own. DNA from other Baby Garnet relatives led detectives to Jenna’s FamilyTreeDNA kit, according to court documents.  Jenna Gerwatowski, left, says the case was always a big mystery in her town. She had no idea the grandmother she'd never met, Nancy Gerwatowski, right, could be behind it. Jenna Rose Gerwatowski/Mackinac County Sheriff's Office  The detective said a woman from Identifinders International, a genetic genealogy investigation firm, would call her about her DNA to help with identifying closer relatives, according to Jenna.  According to court documents, detectives reopened the cold case in 2017 and then worked with a forensics company to extract DNA from Baby Garnet’s partial femur, before sending the results to Identifinders International.  Jenna explained the situation to her mother when she got home from work.  “It was just crazy,” Jenna said. “We were both sitting there like, I don’t even know who (the mother or father) could’ve been. We were both so confused and we’re like, it’s got to be somebody that we don’t know, you know, like a distant cousin or something.”  Jenna said her mother, Kara Gerwatowski, started to wonder whether the detective call was a scam.  Jenna’s grandfather had just been scammed by someone claiming to be a detective, so Kara told Jenna to be cautious about giving out personal information or passwords.  Misty Gillis, then a senior forensic genealogist and cold case liaison from Identifinders International, called Jenna that night, according to Jenna and court documents filed later in the case.  Jenna claims Gillis requested her FamilyTreeDNA password to be able to upload her DNA into a separate database. Jenna was concerned it was a scammer and refused to cooperate, according to court documents.  “I hung up the phone on her, not even thinking twice about it. And we went about our day. I was like, how weird. What a weird thing to scam people about,” Jenna said. “I wholeheartedly did not think that it was real.”  One week later, Jenna was working at the flower shop when she got a distressed call from her mother.  “She was like, ‘I really need you to come home. … It’s an emergency. Like, just please come as soon as you can,’” Jenna said.  Jenna rushed home thinking someone died. Her cousin was sitting with her mom at their round wooden kitchen table. Police had contacted her cousin, who works as a victim’s advocate in the county prosecutor’s office, to explain the Baby Garnet situation to Jenna. It turned out it wasn’t a scam.  “My mom had tears in her eyes,” she said. Jenna’s cousin had “just pure shock on her face. … You could hear a pin drop in there.”  Even though Jenna knew she had nothing to do with the Baby Garnet case, she was terrified police would think she was trying to hide something because of her refusal to speak with Gillis. She immediately called her.  An analysis of Jenna’s DNA kit showed she was the half-niece to Baby Garnet, according to court records.  On June 1, 2022, detectives spoke with her mother, Kara, who agreed to provide her DNA. Kara was the half-sister of Baby Garnet, according to court records.  “I feel like that is when, like, all of the puzzle pieces kind of started falling together for her,” Jenna said. “And she told detectives that, if it’s going to be anybody, it would be (her) mother.”  Kara, now 42, had not spoken with her mother, Nancy Gerwatowski, since she was 18 because they had a bad relationship, and Jenna had never met her grandmother. Regardless, both were shocked Nancy, who was living in Wyoming when police questioned her, would be the one behind their town mystery.  “I had grown up knowing about the case my whole life and then come to find out it was my grandma that did it?” Jenna said.  The Michigan attorney general’s office alleges Nancy “delivered the newborn alone at her Newberry home, during which Baby Garnet died due to asphyxiation, and that this death could have been prevented by medical intervention (Nancy) Gerwatowski did not seek.”  However, in a court filing, Nancy’s defense argues she unexpectedly gave birth while in the bathtub and the fetus “became trapped inside her birth canal.” She “attempted to pull the fetus out of her own body,” the filing says, but couldn’t deliver the fetus and lost consciousness “at some point in the delivery.” When she was finally able to deliver the fetus, it was dead, the filing says.  Her defense argues that Nancy, like the average person in the county in 1997, did not have access to a telephone or cell line, so she couldn’t call 911. While she concedes in her legal filings she placed the stillborn fetus in a bag and left the remains at the campground, her defense attorneys argue she had been in shock after having had no pain medication during the traumatic birth.  Nancy is charged with one count each of open murder, involuntary manslaughter, and concealing the death of an individual. Open murder carries a potential life sentence.  In a hearing on Thursday, Nancy’s defense argued that the case against her should be dropped in its entirety because the state cannot prove the baby was born alive. If the court allows the case to proceed, the defense argued, Nancy’s statements during police interrogation should be excluded because she was denied her right to counsel — a contention the state disputed. If the court does allow her statements to be a part of the trial, Nancy’s lawyers want her comments about considering an abortion and not seeking out prenatal care to be excluded, while the state argued the comments are relevant to possible motive.  Judge Brian D. Rahilly said he hopes to reach a decision on whether or not to drop the charges by next week or around the end of the year at the latest.  “It was a very hard time … very traumatizing and very nerve-wracking,” said Jenna. “I’ve never met this woman, so it was hard for me to even grasp that concept, but even harder for my mom because that was her mother.”",US,-0.9991
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-thursday-hnk/index.html,CNN,left,International,UnitedHealthCare CEO shooting: Suspect Luigi Mangione now faces mounting evidence,"CNN —  Marked shell casings from the assassination scene match the gun found on the suspect. His fingerprints match some key items investigators found nearby. And he was arrested this week – after going silent from his mom and friends for months – with a fake ID and a handwritten “claim of responsibility” referencing the crime site.  These details and others, shared by law enforcement and people who know suspect Luigi Mangione, have been mounting since last week’s daylight killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a busy sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of the investigation into Thompson’s killing, sources tell CNN.  A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN at least two of the warrants include the backpack found in Central Park and the burner phone found along the getaway route police believe Mangione took from the shooting scene. Investigators also searched the hostel where suspected killer Mangione stayed the night before the shooting and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  After a five-day, multi-state manhunt that leaned heavily on surveillance images and pleas for the public’s help, Mangione, 26, is now charged in the case with murder after a tip led to his arrest Monday at a McDonald’s nearly 200 miles from where the brazen homicide unfolded.  Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury in the case against Mangione, sources told ABC News.  Mangione was charged in a felony arrest warrant earlier this week. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  Blair County Judge David Consiglio scheduled a hearing in Pennsylvania on December 30 in response to Mangione’s petitions for writ of habeas corpus and imposition of bail, court documents from Thursday show.  Mangione was denied bail on Tuesday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania. The habeas corpus petition is a key factor in whether the suspect can be extradited to New York.  Mangione’s team was given two weeks from Tuesday to file the habeas corpus petition, which challenges Pennsylvania’s ability to prove that Mangione is the person the state of New York has issued the arrest warrant for, according to Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.  Mangione is also set to appear in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, court on December 23 for a preliminary hearing related to state charges.  Mangione’s lawyer has denied his client’s involvement in the December 4 killing and anticipates he will plead not guilty to the murder and other charges in New York, as well as to charges related to the 3D-printed gun and fake ID in Pennsylvania, where he was caught and is being held without bond.  Defense attorney Thomas Dickey on Wednesday also dismissed the ballistics and fingerprint evidence revealed publicly hours earlier, saying he wants to examine it himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”  Thomas Dickey, attorney for suspected shooter Luigi Mangione, speaks Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “As lawyers, we need to see it. We need to see: How did they collect it? How much of it? And then we would have our experts … take a look at that, and then we would challenge its admissibility and challenge the accuracy of those results.”  Still, New York’s governor expects a murder indictment “to be issued any day now, and the second that happens, I’m issuing a warrant for extradition.”  “It feels like the evidence is very compelling,” Gov. Kathy Hochul told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. “I trust the DA here in Manhattan to make sure that he puts forth an indictment that is going to be iron-clad.”  Meanwhile, Hochul is unimpressed by the folk hero status Mangione has attained on social media as the killing of Thompson – a husband and father of two – has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry.  Mangione appears to have been driven by anger against the industry and “corporate greed” as a whole, states a New York Police Department intelligence report that also warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  “That horrific attack occurred on our streets,” Hochul said Thursday. “And the people of our city deserve to have that sense of calm that this perpetrator has been caught, and he will be never seeing the late of day again if there is justice.”  “You cannot assassinate an individual on the streets of New York – not now, not ever.”  Neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said on Thursday.  Suspect hadn’t spoken to mother since July  Until he was found Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Mangione had gone quiet from at least a few people who appear to have been close with him. The scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, he had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  Mangione’s mother had reported him missing November 18 – two weeks before Thompson’s killing – a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. She called police in San Francisco, where she knew her son had been living, and told authorities she’d called his phone repeatedly to find the voicemail full and not taking any more messages.  Mangione’s mom had no reason to believe her son was a danger to himself or others, she told the San Francisco Police Department, but she hadn’t actually spoken with him since July 1, the official said. He had worked remotely at TrueCar, she also said, where the phone was disconnected and the offices closed, the official added.  It also doesn’t appear Mangione had posted anything since midsummer to social media, where posts addressed to his X account suggest some of his friends have been trying to get in touch with him.  In July, a user tweeted at Mangione, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding. In late November, just weeks before the shooting, another user posted at Mangione, “thinking of you and prayers everyday in your name. Know you are missed and loved.”  As Mangione entered a Pennsylvania courthouse this week, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, he yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Suspected shooter Luigi Mangione is led from the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “He’s irritated, agitated about what’s happening to him and what he’s being accused of,” Dickey told CNN of Mangione’s outburst and struggle with police.  “He never had any legal representation until he walked into that building yesterday. And I talked to him … look at the difference between when he went in and when he came out … now he has a spokesperson and someone that’s going to fight for him.”  Suspect linked to fingerprints and gun  Police in New York on Wednesday publicly revealed the first positive forensic match and direct physical evidence tying Mangione to Thompson’s killing, law enforcement officials told CNN.  “We got the gun in question back from Pennsylvania. It’s now at the NYPD crime lab,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “We were able to match that gun to the three shell casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of the homicide.”  A 3D-printed gun was in Mangione’s possession when he was arrested Monday, police have said.  The three 9 mm shell casings had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, one word per bullet, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Police have been looking into whether those words, which match the title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry, may point to a motive in the killing.  Authorities also had been probing DNA material and a partial fingerprint from a discarded Starbucks water bottle and an energy bar wrapper surveillance images showed the suspect buying about 30 minutes before the shooting. Mangione’s fingerprints were confirmed as a match, Tisch said  Along with the prints and ballistics, investigators have been examining writings police have said Mangione had upon arrest, including a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility.” It did not include specific threats but indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday.  In some writings, he referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny added. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  Investigators also are looking at the suspect’s writing in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.  It included to-do lists to facilitate a killing, as well as notes justifying those plans, the source said. In one notebook passage, Mangione wrote about the late Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber who justified a deadly bombing campaign as an effort to protect against the onslaught of technology and exploitation. Mangione had written about the Unabomber in online posts as well.  In a notebook passage, Mangione concludes using a bomb against his intended victim “could kill innocents” and shooting would be more targeted, musing what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.

The statement did not indicate where Kobayashi was or how the family determined she was safe.  The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement they are “happy to learn that Hannah has been found safe” and due to the new information “this has become a private matter and we will wrap up our investigation.”  The family had launched a GoFundMe that raised over $47,000 to help find Hannah. Donations have been turned off, and donors who would like a refund can submit a claim, the family said.  Hannah Kobayashi arrived at Los Angeles International Airport from Maui on November 8, but did not board her connecting flight to New York, her sister previously told CNN. The family last heard from the 30-year-old on November 11 after spending four days in Los Angeles at various locations, according to video footage and photos.  Video Ad Feedback A timeline of Hannah Kobayashi's last-known locations 03:14 - Source: CNN  Video footage shows Hannah Kobayashi retrieving her luggage from baggage claim at LAX on November 11 after she requested it be returned from New York, and she then traveled via LA Metro to Union Station where she used her passport and cash to purchase a ticket that took her to the US-Mexico border, police said. She was declared a missing person on November 15.  More than three weeks after she left Maui, Los Angeles police declared her as a voluntary missing person on December 2. Video surveillance from US Customs and Border Protection “clearly shows” Hannah Kobayashi crossing the US-Mexico border just after noon on November 12 at the San Ysidro port of entry, police said.  “To date the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a news conference. “She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her.”  Volunteers put up flyers of missing Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi outside Crypto.com Arena in Downtown Los Angeles. Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images/File  Before leaving Maui, investigators found Hannah Kobayashi had expressed a desire to disconnect from modern technology, police said.  Tragedy struck the family during their search for Hannah Kobayashi when her father Ryan Kobayashi, who had traveled from Hawaii to Los Angeles to help look for her, was found dead November 24 near the airport, having taken his own life, the family and authorities say.  Hannah Kobayashi’s aunt, Larie Pidgeon, told CNN that he “died of a broken heart.”  This story has been updated with additional information.",US,-0.8042

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/louisville-police-reform-breonna-taylor/index.html,CNN,left,International,"DOJ, Louisville reach deal after probe prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor","Louisville, Kentucky AP —  The US Justice Department and the city of Louisville have reached an agreement to reform the city’s police force after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, officials said Thursday.  The consent decree, which must be approved by a judge, follows a federal investigation that found Louisville police have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the “historic content decree” will build upon and accelerate, this transformational police reform we have already begun in Louisville.” He noted that “significant improvements” have already been implemented since Taylor’s death in March 2020. That includes a city law banning the use of “no-knock” warrants.  The Justice Department report released in March 2023 said the Louisville police department “discriminates against Black people in its enforcement activities,” uses excessive force and conducts searches based on invalid warrants. It also said the department violates the rights of people engaged in protests.  “This conduct harmed community members and undermined public trust in law enforcement that is essential for public safety,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This consent decree marks a new day for Louisville.”  Once the consent decree is agreed upon, a federal officer will monitor the progress made by the city.  The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened 12 civil rights investigations into law enforcement agencies, but this is the first that has reached a consent decree. The Justice Department and the city of Springfield, Massachusetts announced an agreement in 2022 but the investigation into that police department was opened under President Donald Trump’s first administration.  City officials in Memphis have taken a different approach, pushing against the need for a Justice Department consent decree to enact reforms in light of a federal investigation launched after Tyre Nichols’ killing that found Memphis officers routinely use unwarranted force and disproportionately target Black people. Memphis officials have not ruled eventually agreeing to a consent decree, but have said the city can make changes more effectively without committing to a binding pact.  It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department’s priorities around civil rights.",US,0.9902
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,International,New Jersey drones: Lawmakers meet with security officials after weeks of unexplained sightings,"CNN —  Weeks of mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey are prompting heightened security concerns – and mounting frustrations – from residents, military personnel and federal, state and local officials.  While the state’s governor says there’s no threat to public safety, other state officials and local mayors are alarmed.  “I’m legitimately concerned for what the hell is going on because nobody knows,” state Assemblyman Brian Bergen told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey after a briefing at state police headquarters on Wednesday.  “We are literally being invaded by drones. We have no idea who is doing it and where they’re coming from,” Pequannock Mayor Ryan Herb told the station after the briefing.  Law enforcement has not identified the origin or landing sites of the drones, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday. He added that the drones primarily operate at night, often displaying flashing lights, but they turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached.  According to Melham, the drones have eluded radar detection, possibly because they do not emit frequencies or possess evasion capabilities.  He also raised alarm over where some of the drones have been spotted.  “One of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey’s critical infrastructure,” Melham said.  The mayor of West Milford, Michele Dale, reported 60 drones hovering over local reservoirs.  Some members of Congress have speculated that a foreign entity may be involved in the drones, something the Pentagon rebuffed Wednesday.  The denial came hours after US Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, told Fox News the drones were from “a mothership” from Iran that is “off the East Coast of the United States of America.”  “There is not any truth to that,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.”  Meanwhile, US Northern Command, which oversees the Defense Department’s homeland security efforts, said in statement Wednesday that it had “conducted a deliberate analysis of the events” regarding the drone sightings but had not been asked “to assist with these events.”  A spokesperson for the US Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged an encounter by one of its assets with the drones.  “Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  The aircraft were not seen as an immediate threat and did not interfere with operations, Pinneo added.  CNN reached out to the Coast Guard but did not receive an immediate response.  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told WBGO on Wednesday the public should feel secure while acknowledging their fears.  “Based on everything we know, there is no public safety risks we’re aware of,” Murphy said.  “Is it frustrating to have no answers? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes,” the governor told the radio station.  The sightings began November 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. At times, large drones — some up to 6 feet in diameter — were seen nightly in New Jersey from dusk until 11 p.m., with sightings ranging from 4 to 180, according to state lawmakers who attended the briefing Wednesday.  The drones operate in a coordinated manner, turning off their lights to evade detection, complicating tracking efforts. They are not identified as hobbyist drones or linked to the Department of Homeland Security, State Assembly member Dawn Fantasia said on X.  The FBI is leading the investigation with the New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, while the US Coast Guard is assessing jurisdictional responses.  Federal agencies have ruled out any connections of local, state, or federal governments to the sightings.  Melham called for a temporary flight ban on all personnel and commercial drones in his video update, despite official advisories against such measures.  Concerns escalated after drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to military officials and state lawmakers. The sightings prompted the FAA to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.  Unnerved residents have described frequently seeing the drones hovering overhead, sometimes traveling in clusters.  While visiting family in New Jersey, travel content creator Katie Caf initially doubted reports of drones until she spotted several moving in a “zigzagging” pattern on Saturday. The 29-year-old noticed five potential drones, which she described as being the size of a bicycle. “They’re so weird looking and they’re much bigger than normal drones. I get why everyone is freaking out now … I think it’s kinda spooky.”  Fantasia said on X that the briefing occurred Wednesday at the New Jersey State Police headquarters and included descriptions of the aircraft’s movements and federal agencies’ response.  Though Murphy has said there is no known threat to the public, Fantasia and other local leaders have expressed doubt and are demanding more transparency into the investigation.  US Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, pushed for more information from federal investigators in a letter sent Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  “I recognize the need to maintain operational security of ongoing investigations and that this situation requires complex interagency coordination,” Booker wrote. “However, there is a growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state – from constituents and local officials alike – despite assurances that the drones pose no known threats to public safety.”  The FBI in Newark has asked the public to report any information related to the drones, including in several areas along the Raritan River.  “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI field office in Newark said December 3.  During a US Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday, Robert Wheeler, assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, called the phenomenon “concerning” but said “there is nothing that is known” that would lead him to identify a public safety risk.  CNN has sought more information from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and New Jersey State Police.  This story has been updated with additional information.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/university-of-mississippi-student-killing-mistrial/index.html,CNN,left,International,Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee: Judge declares mistrial after jury deadlocks over killing of gay University of Mississippi student,"AP —  A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the case of Sheldon “Timothy” Herrington Jr. in the 2022 killing of Jimmie “Jay” Lee, a gay man who was prominent in the LGBTQ+ community at the University of Mississippi.  Jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict after over nine and a half hours of deliberation.  Lee’s body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead.  Herrington, 24, showed little emotion as he left the courtroom with his attorneys and several relatives. He remains free on bond and is still charged with capital murder, which Mississippi law defines as a killing committed along with another felony — in this case, kidnapping. Prosecutors had said they would not seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison if he is tried again and convicted.  Jurors on Wednesday were told they could also consider lesser charges of first-degree murder, punishable by life in prison; second-degree murder, 20 years to life; or manslaughter, up to 20 years.  University of Mississippi student Jimmie ""Jay"" Lee is seen in this undated image. Oxford Police Police Department  Circuit Judge Kelly Luther said he will consult with prosecutors and defense attorneys about setting another trial.  Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee, 20, was pursuing a master’s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.  Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, where the university is located and the trial was held.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee vanished. Investigators testified that they used warrants to obtain electronic records including explicit messages between social media accounts belonging to the two men and online searches conducted by Herrington, including one inquiring how long it takes to strangle someone.  Prosecutors said during closing arguments Wednesday that Herrington and Lee had a sexual encounter that ended badly and Lee left Herrington’s apartment. They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex. Prosecutors said Lee was killed after going back.  “Tim Herrington lived a lie — lived a lie to his family,” District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. “He lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.”  Herrington’s attorney, Kevin Horan, has said prosecutors cannot prove Lee is dead without having a body. He told jurors Wednesday that text messages showed Herrington did not lure Lee to his apartment.  Judge Kelly Luther presides over the case of Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr. at the Lafayette County Courthouse in Oxford, Mississippi, on Wednesday. Bruce Newman/Pool/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal/AP  “He’s the one that’s being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,” Horan said of Lee.  Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.  Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained explicit messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.  Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched “how long does it take to strangle someone” at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.  The final text message from Lee’s phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington’s apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee’s phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee’s car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.  On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.  Herrington’s relatives sat behind him in the courtroom, and Lee’s sat behind prosecutors. When Luther dismissed court after the mistrial, he instructed the two groups to leave separately.  Jurors were chosen from another county about 250 miles to the south. They heard eight days of arguments and testimony.  The judge twice urged jurors to continue deliberating when they said they were deadlocked. After the third such message, Luther declared the mistrial and thanked them for serving, adding: “I’ve asked a lot of you.”",US,-0.9977
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/us/timeline-luigi-magione-ceo-shooting/index.html,CNN,left,International,Timeline: Before and after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s killing,"CNN —  As investigators work to piece together the possible motive and movements of 26-year-old Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione, suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, here’s what we know.  This timeline is based on information from law enforcement sources, official police releases, surveillance images and social media records.  Summer of 2024  Mangione had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  During the summer, Mangione appears to stop posting online, prompting worried messages from some of his friends.  In July, one user posts on X, tagging Mangione, saying, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding.  Mid-November  Mangione’s mother reports her son missing in San Francisco, law enforcement officials said.  Sunday, November 24  10:11 p.m. – Mangione arrives in New York at the Port Authority bus terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue via a bus that originated in Atlanta, then gets into a cab that takes him to the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, where he stays about half an hour.  There was an interaction while the suspect was checking in at the hostel, making casual conversation. ""At some point, he pulled his mask down and smiled at the at the clerk,"" said Joseph Kenny, NYPD chief of detectives. NYPD  11 p.m. – He takes another cab to a hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave. on the Upper West Side, identified as HI New York City Hostel in charging documents.  11:20 p.m. - Surveillance footage from the hostel shows him checking in and showing a driver’s license, according to the arrest warrant in the case. Records from the hostel show he provided a New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario on it, the warrant says.  Friday, November 29  Mangione checks out of the hostel.  “It’s not your traditional check in, check out. It’s the kind of thing where if you don’t show up at a certain time, they automatically just check you out,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. “We don’t believe that he went someplace else. It’s more of an administrative checkout.”  Saturday, November 30  Mangione checks back into the hostel.  Wednesday, December 4  5:34 a.m. – Surveillance footage reviewed by law enforcement shows Mangione leaving the hostel, possibly by bike.  5:41 a.m. – He is seen wandering around the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown, on Sixth Avenue between West 53rd and 54th Streets, and goes back and forth for a bit before heading toward a Starbucks.  “We have him wandering around, walking in the vicinity of hotel, walking on 54th Street, walking back and forth,” Kenny said.  Around 6:17 a.m. – Images from Starbucks show him buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, according to a law enforcement official.  Image of the suspect at a Starbucks on Sixth Avenue. NYPD  6:19 a.m. – Surveillance video near a deli on West 55th Street appears to show him walking and briefly stopping by a pile of trash.  Gideon Platt, Stage Star Deli  6:30 a.m. – Around 6:30 a.m., surveillance video captures what appears to be the gunman on the phone.  Patrick Laborde  6:44 a.m. – Thompson, the victim, walks toward the Hilton after leaving his hotel across the street, police said.  The masked gunman is “lying in wait” outside the hotel as Thompson makes his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.  The gunman comes up behind Thompson and shoots him in the back, Kenny said. He then walks toward Thompson and continues to shoot, stopping to clear a gun jam before firing again.  Obtained by CNN  Investigators told CNN that after the shooting, the assailant crosses the street from the Hilton, flees northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street, and gets on an electric bike on 55th Street before heading north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.  Obtained by CNN  6:48 a.m. – Mangione is seen riding an electric bike into Central Park at 60th Street, according to Kenny.  NYPD  6:56 a.m. – He rides out of the park.  6:58 a.m. - He is seen on the bike at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue.  7:00 a.m. - He is no longer on the bike and is heading northbound on 86th Street.  7:04 a.m. - Mangione gets into a cab.  7:30 a.m. – He is seen near the George Washington Bridge and a Port Authority bus station off 178th Street.  Video shows the suspect entering the bus station.  “We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” Kenny said.  5-Day Manhunt  The suspect was in Pennsylvania for “several days” after the shooting in Manhattan, according to Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police.  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the suspect traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in Altoona, where he is arrested.  Monday, December 9  In a new post on social media, Pennsylvania State Police shared new images of Luigi Mangione sitting inside the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was captured on Monday. The images show Mangione eating what appears to be a hash brown inside the establishment. Pennsylvania State Police  9:14 a.m. - Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania are dispatched to a McDonald’s restaurant, after an employee tipped off police about someone resembling photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police.  9:58 a.m. - Mangione is taken into custody at the McDonald’s, where he presented police with a forged New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario as his identification – the same ID he presented at the hostel, according to the arrest warrant.  Mangione was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea in his first court appearance in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, later that day.  Mangione has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a firearm, according to charging documents released by New York prosecutors.",US,-0.9823

Ryan Borgwardt, 45, was booked into the Green Lake County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system, a service that provides information to crime victims such as a person’s jail custody status. No charges were listed.  The Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday in a social media post that a news conference would be held Wednesday morning to update the Borgwardt case. The post said no further information would be provided until then.  A person answering the phone at the sheriff’s office Tuesday night declined to confirm whether Borgwardt was in custody. County jail officials didn’t immediately return a phone message Tuesday night.  Last month, Sheriff Mark Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on November 11 after disappearing for three months but that he hadn’t committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were “pulling at his heartstrings” to come home. He suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance.  Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of “personal matters,” the sheriff said. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it’s the deepest in Wisconsin.  After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane.  The sheriff said at the time that investigators were working to verify Borgwardt’s description of what happened.  The sheriff’s office has said the search for Borgwardt’s body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn’t expect the search to last more than two weeks.",US,-0.9398

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-abc-news-defamation-lawsuit-settle/index.html,CNN,left,International,ABC News settles defamation suit with Trump for $15 million,"CNN —  ABC News will pay $15 million to a “presidential foundation and museum” in a settlement reached with President-elect Donald Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.  The settlement, which was filed publicly Saturday, reveals the network will also pay $1 million in Trump’s attorneys’ fees and will issue an apology.  ABC News will issue the following statement as an editor’s note on the online article at the center of the suit: “ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J. Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC’s This Week on March 10, 2024.”  “We are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,” an ABC News spokesperson wrote in a statement.  Trump filed the lawsuit in Florida federal court earlier this year, arguing that Stephanopoulos and ABC News defamed him when the anchor said 10 times during a contentious on-air interview with South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace in March that a jury found Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll.  Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and that he defamed her when he denied her claim. Trump has denied all wrongdoing toward Carroll.  In 2023, a jury found that Trump sexually abused Carroll, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, though it did not find that Carroll proved he raped her. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million for battery and defamation. In January, Carroll was awarded an additional $83.3 million in damages for defamatory statements made by Trump that disparaged her and denied her rape allegations.  A judge concluded in August 2023, when dismissing Trump’s countersuit against Carroll, that the claim Trump raped Carroll was “substantially true.” The judge wrote that Trump “raped” her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.  In the lawsuit filed against ABC News in March, Trump claimed that Stephanopoulos’ statements were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.”  A judge in July refused to dismiss Trump’s lawsuit against the network, writing that these definitions were different enough. He added that the case would turn on “whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury’s verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.”  The settlement came a day after a federal judge ruled that Trump and Stephanopoulos must sit for a deposition sometime next week. The president-elect can now avoid testifying under oath, which could have come with potential legal risks as he prepares to return to the White House.  Trump has a history of filing lawsuits against the news media. In late October, he filed a lawsuit against CBS, demanding $10 billion in damages over the network’s “60 Minutes” interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. His legal counsel claimed the interview with Harris and the associated programming were “partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference” intended to “mislead the public and attempt to tip the scales” of the presidential election in her favor.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-administration-big-donors/index.html,CNN,left,International,Big donors secure big roles in the incoming Trump administration,"CNN —  Nearly three dozen of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks to serve in his incoming administration donated to his campaign or to the deep-pocketed outside groups that worked to elect him, a CNN analysis of federal campaign records shows.  They range from tech multibillionaire Elon Musk – who has emerged as the single largest, disclosed political donor of the 2024 presidential election – to others close to Trump tapped for key roles throughout government.  In all, eight of his Cabinet picks – led by Linda McMahon, the billionaire wrestling magnate Trump has selected to oversee the Education Department – and their spouses donated more than $37 million combined from their personal accounts to aid Trump, the review found, underscoring the proliferation of ultra-rich Americans now poised to shape US policy in the incoming second Trump administration.  (Two other Cabinet choices, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, transferred money from their campaign accounts to the pro-Trump effort.)  Musk has not been selected for a formal Cabinet job but is helping guide a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative and has played a pivotal role in the presidential transition – offering his views on job candidates, talking to world leaders and meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as he weighs how to downsize the federal government.  In all, the SpaceX and Tesla chief executive donated more than $277 million to federal elections this cycle, the lion’s share of which – more than $262 million – benefited Trump. Most of Musk’s pro-Trump dollars flowed to a super PAC that the world’s richest man created to help turn out voters on the Republican’s behalf in key swing states.  Outside of self-funded presidential candidates, no individual has donated more to shape federal contests in a single election cycle, said Brendan Glavin, research director of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes money in politics.  Trump’s donors “are not just getting these sort of plum ambassadorships on the side,” Glavin said. “Major donors are getting positions that affect policy.”  The CNN analysis researched the more than 90 people that Trump had announced for high-level positions in the administration through Tuesday, which marked five weeks since his election victory. More than 30 of them had donated to his campaign or to one of the leading Trump-aligned outside groups, the review of FEC records found.  “Millions of Americans fed up with failure in the White House and federal government joined President Trump in the movement to restore our nation’s greatness. Some who will work with President Trump are among those millions of people who supported the campaign and helped the President win a decisive electoral victory,” Brian Hughes, a Trump transition team spokesman, said in a statement in response to CNN’s inquiry about donors joining the administration.  The total donations from Trump’s current Cabinet picks marks a surge from Trump’s first term. Five members of his original Cabinet had donated nearly $8 million to his committees or to the major outside groups supporting him, a review of campaign reports shows.  Donations from McMahon, who served as Trump’s SBA administrator in his first White House term, accounted for more than 90% of that total in the 2016 election.  The sums spent to aid Trump in 2024 far exceed the donations that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet members contributed to help him win the White House in 2020, FEC records show.  A dozen members of Biden’s Cabinet reported donations to his campaign or major super PACs involved in the 2020 election, giving less than $100,000 in total.  Billionaires in the administration  Musk’s spending dwarfed that of other supporters.  McMahon was the largest donor among Trump’s Cabinet picks and the second most generous contributor, after Musk, among the administration members announced through Tuesday, the review found.  Most of the $21.2 million she donated went to Make American Great Again, Inc., the main Trump-affiliated super PAC that spent heavily on advertising to aid his campaign.  Other seven-figure donors among Trump’s Cabinet picks include Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick, whom Trump has tapped to serve as Commerce secretary; Scott Bessent, the hedge fund executive Trump has selected to oversee the Treasury Department; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, his choice to head the Small Business Administration.  Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher, also was a major donor, contributing more than $2 million to the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and Trump’s joint fundraising committee.  Sprecher is the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and was at Trump’s side when the president-elect rang the opening bell at the exchange Thursday.  In an email, Loeffler’s communication director Caitlin O’Dea said, “Senator Loeffler is proud to be one of President Trump’s strongest supporters for the same reason a historic landslide of Americans voted to put him back in the White House: he will restore American prosperity, security, and opportunity.”  The billionaire embrace marks a turnaround of sorts for Trump, who saw corporate America recoil from him after the violent January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And he has seen new support from tech leaders who are pushing for fewer regulations from the federal government.  The staggering sums spent by Musk in this year’s election helped Trump close the financial advantage of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who swiftly raised $1 billion after becoming her party’s standard-bearer in late July.  Super PACs face no limit on the size of donations they can receive or spend, but technically are not allowed coordinate their advertising decisions with the candidates they support.  However, a ruling this year by the FEC granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing efforts freed up Musk to guide a ground game for Trump.  “The campaign finance system is a joke,” said Fred Wertheimer, who heads the Democracy 21 watchdog group and is a longtime advocate for limits on money in politics. “Musk is the example now of how campaign finance laws have failed.”  He said he worries about government departments led by billionaires who have no “interest in doing the job that the agency was assigned.”  Musk did not respond to inquiries from CNN.  But Tom Davis, a former congressman from Virginia who chaired the House Republicans’ campaign arm for several years, argues “there is nothing inherently wrong about people who made a lot of money wanting to give back through government.”  “The fact that they have contributed shows a degree of loyalty,” he added.  Friends and family  Presidents often reward donors and allies with plum positions – often dispatching them to glamorous, low-conflict posts in Europe or the Caribbean.  Some of Trump’s early picks for ambassadorships follow that pattern and include billionaires who donated to his reelection effort. Among them: Arkansas investor Warren Stephens, named as the US’ envoy to the UK, and Charles Kushner, Trump’s choice for ambassador to France – one of several extended family members or close friends who has been chosen for diplomatic gigs.  Kushner, who donated $2 million to pro-Trump efforts and received a presidential pardon at the end of Trump’s first term, is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. Another donor, Tom Barrack, who oversaw the fundraising for Trump’s first inauguration, is his choice as ambassador to Turkey.  And incoming special envoy to the Middle East, real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff, is a longtime Trump friend and a partner in the cryptocurrency businesses that Trump launched with his sons earlier this year.  He donated $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC.",US,0.9994
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/antony-blinken-jordan-syria/index.html,CNN,left,International,"US has had direct contact with Syrian rebel group, Blinken says","Aqaba, Jordan CNN —  The United States has had direct contact with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Syrian rebel group now in de-facto control of the country, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday.  The first public confirmation of direct interaction with the US-designated terrorist group, known as HTS, came at the conclusion of Blinken’s diplomatic sprint through the region spurred by the sudden collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  “Yes, we’ve been in contact with HTS and the other parties,” Blinken said at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan. Blinken did not give details on when the contact was made or at what level. There is no legal barrier to speaking with a designated terrorist group.  “We have pressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,” Blinken said, referencing the American journalist who was detained in Syria more than a decade ago. The US has redoubled its efforts to find him in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse.  The US also shared the principles expected of a new Syrian government, including that the rights of all Syrians should be respected, that the country must not become a base for terrorism, that humanitarian aid must be delivered, and that chemical weapons stockpiles should be secured and safely destroyed.  Those principles, circulated by the US in the days after Assad’s shocking ouster, were further agreed upon in a joint statement by the US and a coalition of other countries at an urgent ministerial meeting in Aqaba on Saturday. Blinken said the agreement “sends a unified message to the new interim authority and parties in Syria.”  Ahead of the Saturday ministerial meeting, Blinken met with key partners in Jordan, Turkey and Iraq to garner consensus around the principles.  “America and our partners have an important stake in helping the Syrian people chart this new path,” the top US diplomat said Saturday. “We know what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders — from mass displacement to terrorism.”  “We can’t underestimate the challenges of this moment and the weeks and months ahead,” he added.  Throughout his trip, Blinken sought to emphasize those stakes. Moving forward, the dynamics on the ground in the region could present significant complications, despite a consensus on the principles.  There was an intense spate of fighting in recent weeks in northern Syria between Turkish-backed forces and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which the US sees as a key partner in the fight to keep ISIS degraded.  A fragile truce between the two sides in Manbij appears to be holding, but the fighting forced the SDF to halt its anti-ISIS operations, according to its top commander.  “This is a moment of vulnerability in which ISIS will seek to regroup, taking the advantage of transition in Syria,” Blinken said Saturday, reemphasizing the importance of the SDF.  In meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Ankara, Blinken warned the US does not want to see any party take actions that would allow ISIS to regroup, including by distracting the SDF from its mission to keep the terrorist group degraded and its fighters imprisoned, a US official said. Blinken also emphasized that nobody should take actions that could jeopardize factions in Syria from potentially coming together in a unified government.  In Baghdad, Blinken asked Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to crack down on the powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and to prevent Iran from transiting weapons through Iraq to Shia militias in Syria, the US official said. Such militias have targeted US personnel and interests in the past.  The response to Israel’s actions in Syria has also emerged as point of division between the US and its Arab partners.  Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has pummeled Syria with strikes and sent Israeli troops to — and beyond — a “buffer zone” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria, in what the United Nations said would be a violation of a 1974 agreement. Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Qatar have condemned Israel’s seizure of the buffer zone, calling it an attempted land grab.  The US, however, has not condemned the move, with Blinken saying that they are talking with the Israeli government.  “The stated purpose of those actions from the Israelis is to try to make sure that equipment that’s been abandoned — military equipment that’s been abandoned by the Syrian army — doesn’t fall into the wrong hands: terrorists, extremists, etc.,” he said Thursday. “But … we’re already talking with Israel; we’re all talking to others about the way ahead.”  A US official said Friday that Blinken intends to make clear to his Arab counterparts that Israel told the US that the incursion is temporary — and that the US expects it to be. That policy could change, however, next month when the Trump administration takes office, this official conceded.  This story has been updated with additional information.",US,-0.9886

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-ban-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,left,International,TikTok’s ban won’t be delayed. Here’s what you should know,"CNN —  TikTok has plans for another appeal as it faces a ban on January 19.  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected a temporary pause on the ban of TikTok, calling such a block “unwarranted” and paving the way for the Supreme Court to potentially decide the fate of the popular video-sharing app.  In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that required TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, to be sold to a non-Chinese company. The latest ruling follows last week’s decision by the same appeals court to uphold the law, citing national security concerns.  The Biden administration previously urged the appeals court not to issue a temporary block on the law, arguing that doing so might allow the company to wait months to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, effectively halting the law indefinitely.  “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said on December 6.  What will TikTok’s next appeal look like?  The Supreme Court could make a quick decision on the case. Both TikTok and the federal government previously asked the appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the January 19 ban.  But the Supreme Court, which has a six-justice conservative majority, seems likely to rule in favor of upholding the ban, Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN earlier this month.  “I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” Schiller said.  Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN earlier this month that the Supreme Court may decide not to review the case at all, in which case TikTok is out of luck.  Do you need to delete the app?  Not necessarily.  The Department of Justice said Wednesday that, if the ban takes effect, it would “not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok” for the app’s more than 170 million monthly users. But don’t expect any more updates from the app or the ability to download it, if the ban takes place.  Two leaders of the US House of Representatives’ committee on China sent a bipartisan letter to the CEOs of Apple and Google parent company Alphabet that said they should prepare to remove TikTok from their US app stores on January 19.  TikTok will also be unavailable on internet hosting platforms. The Justice Department warned users can expect the app to “eventually” be unworkable.  Can the ban be avoided?  There’s still some hope that TikTok could remain active in the United States, though ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell it.  The ban’s legislation leaves room for Biden to grant a one-time, 90-day extension if he determines a company has made progress toward a sale. He hasn’t suggested any plans to do so.  President-elect Donald Trump, who begins his term a day after the ban, could be on TikTok’s side. He said in July (in a video posted to the app) that he would “never ban TikTok” — although he did try to ban it during his first term.  There are a few options: Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, though experts say that’s unlikely to be successful. He could also direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month.",US,0.9622
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-shop-ban/index.html,CNN,left,International,TikTok Shop was going to be the next big thing. A potential ban could change that,"CNN —  Aakaanksh Autade was iffy on TikTok Shop, TikTok’s in-app shopping feature, when it launched last year. Then the content creator grossed over $100,000 in sales when he hosted a live event on Black Friday and went from skeptic to believer.  Autade is known for sharing tech-related tips and tricks on his TikTok channel, “kaansanity.” He took to TikTok Live for the first time on Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend to promote gadgets like headphones and game consoles. “It was my first time going live, and to make $102,000 in 10 hours was just insane. I didn’t expect it at all,” he said.  Aakaanksh Autade (left) promoted gadgets like the Nintendo Switch via TikTok Live on Cyber Monday. Courtesy Aakaanksh Autade/kaansanity  TikTok Shop allows users to buy and sell products without leaving the app. The sales platform combines entertainment and retail, making it particularly popular among Gen Z buyers, and it continues to grow. It has over 500,000 sellers in the US, including brands like L’Oréal, PacSun and Scrub Daddy.  TikTok Shop raked in $100 million in single-day sales this Black Friday — that’s triple the number from 2023, according to the company. Over Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend alone, the shop saw a 165% increase in shoppers year-over-year, according to a statement by the company this month.  However, a US appeals court this month upheld a law that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 or face a US ban.  That ban could grind the sales platform’s progress to a halt — but creators who spoke to CNN say that they’re sticking with TikTok Shop anyway because they don’t think a ban will actually happen.  “I don’t think TikTok is going anywhere. I think they’re going to figure it out, and there’s so many people invested in TikTok,” Autade said. “It’s hard to ignore how much it means to its users.”  What makes TikTok Shop tick?  TikTok Shop provides a pipeline from discovery to purchase by letting users shop products featured in live videos, pinned on brand and influencer profiles, or tagged in content shown on their algorithm-driven For You page.  Even before the launch of its shopping feature, TikTok had already established a reputation as a place for users to find items to add to their wishlists. A study conducted in 2022 by marketing consulting firm Material Plus found that 61% of users purchased an item after seeing content about it on TikTok, helped by hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which has over 12 million posts.  Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and TikTok creator, said combining passive entertainment with a shopping function can tempt users to open their wallets.  “You’ve got all these people who are spending so much time just being (on TikTok) consuming and creating content,” she said. “When you mix in commerce with our favorite source of entertainment, then we’re going to spend all our money there.”  TikTok Shop’s reliance on user-generated content allows consumers to hear from voices they trust.  Lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk says TikTok Shop's main draw is its ability to let consumers see their favorite influencers use the products they promote in real time. Courtesy Carrie Berk  Social media strategist Keenya Kelly says that TikTok Shop is another avenue for content creators to make money on TikTok without having to leave the app. Courtesy Keenya Kelly  “If you see your favorite creator promoting a product on a live stream or a video, you’re more likely to buy it in that moment,” said Carrie Berk, a lifestyle content creator. The thinking among viewers, she said, is that “if a makeup influencer is promoting a product on TikTok Shop, if she says it’s good, then it must be good.”  TikTok users like Autade also say that the app’s focus on short-form videos gives it an edge over other social media platforms.  “When I click on a product and I can see hundreds or even thousands of people posting a video about that product authentically, that really helps,” he said. “On a different platform, I might just see some words, some reviews, some stars here and there,” but seeing the product in action is different.  Another component of TikTok Shop’s growth is its popularity with younger users. Some 62% of Gen Z consumers say that TikTok is their platform of choice when they need to look something up, beating out search engines like Google, according to a report by marketing technology company SOCi published this year.  “Gen Z as a whole has really chosen TikTok as their premier destination for content,” said Jen Jones, chief marketing officer of e-commerce platform Commercetools. “TikTok shop just seemed like a natural place for those dollars to be spent.”  What would a TikTok ban mean for other social media retail platforms?  Social media shopping is not a new phenomenon.  Ninety-two percent of retailers plan to invest more in social commerce this holiday season, according to a study by Commercetools published in October. The same study showed that Facebook Marketplace was the social commerce platform of choice for businesses, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok Shop and X.  In particular, Jones sees an opportunity for YouTube to fill in the space TikTok could leave behind if a ban comes into force.  She says that YouTube could potentially meet demand for the style of short-form videos popularized by TikTok through YouTube Shorts while capitalizing on its longer-form content.  In the past year alone, people watched over 30 billion hours of shopping-related content on YouTube, the company previously told CNN in an email. In 2023, it launched YouTube Shopping, allowing content creators to tag products from brands featured in their videos and earn commissions.  Experts say that if the TikTok ban happens, it will serve as a lesson for brands to not put all their eggs into one marketing basket.  The Shop tab of the TikTok app is seen on an iPhone on June 23 in Manila, Philippines.

You can’t get locked into just one platform.”  Kelly says the same advice applies to individual content creators who make money off their posts and videos, and recommends cultivating a following through more direct forms of outreach like email lists.  “We use social media to reach a group of people,” she said. “You need to pull those people off social media onto email so that you have control over your business.”  Still, Kelly says she sees no reason for content creators to be concerned over the court ruling that moves TikTok one step closer to a ban.  “I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, she said. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.”  Berk commands an audience of almost 4 million followers on TikTok and describes the social media platform as a big part of her livelihood, but she says she’s not worried by the prospect of a total ban next month.  “There has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical,” she said.  Autade still has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, but he told CNN that TikTok was his primary marketing avenue and the platform that has brought him the most success.  Even as the threat of a ban looms nearer, he says it’s still business as usual and plans to continue with a live event in January similar to the one he hosted on Black Friday.  “I’m still all-in on TikTok. I’m still living my day-to-day life, running my businesses, and everything’s pretty much the same until I hear otherwise,” Autade said.",US,0.9961
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,International,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked.",US,0.2114
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/sony-stock-record/index.html,CNN,left,International,Sony hasn’t been this hot since it made the Walkman,"CNN —  The last time Sony was worth this much on the stock market, Bill Clinton was president and the PlayStation 2 was about to debut on American store shelves.  It’s been a rough past two and a half decades for Sony, the 78-year-old company that invented the Walkman and the PlayStation and had long been an icon of consumer electronics. It largely missed the boat on the mobile phone revolution, and while the PlayStation has been profitable, production costs for other electronics have risen while demand has softened.  But as opportunities arise in streaming, Sony is trying to transition from being a legacy consumer electronics company to an original content and entertainment company.  The strategy is working: In the past three years, Sony’s stock (SONY) has started to break out of a decades-long slump. Sony’s stock price in Japan recently closed at the first record high since March 2000, signifying confidence in the company’s ability to evolve its game offerings and steer itself toward entertainment, Damian Thong, a research equity analyst at Macquarie, told CNN.  “If you went back 30 years ago, it was an electronics company, so best known as a seller of hardware,” Thong said. “But today, the company is primarily generating profits off of entertainment, which is games, music and (TV and movies).”  Less hardware, more content  Sony Group, Japan’s third largest company by market value, has turned itself around by innovating its games business beyond consoles and making acquisitions to expand its IP, Joost van Dreunen, an adjunct assistant professor at NYU Stern who teaches the business of video games, told CNN.  Sony acquired Anime powerhouse Crunchyroll in 2021, and it acquired American video game company Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion.  In addition to Sony Interactive Entertainment, which makes the PlayStation, the behemoth Sony Group also includes Sony Pictures, which produces films like the Spider-Man series, and Sony Music, which includes Columbia Records.  Sony is trying to unlock synergy across its subsidiary companies to produce original entertainment content for consumers, van Dreunen said.  Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal in the first season of ""The Last of Us."" Liane Hentscher/HBO  That strategy of leveraging its intellectual property across its brands became apparent at the 75th Emmy Awards in January, when the TV series “The Last of Us” won eight primetime awards. It was the first time a TV show adapted from a videogame earned major consideration at a Hollywood awards ceremony.  It was a momentous occasion for Sony, which first published “The Last of Us” as a videogame in 2013 before it was adapted to become a TV series released in 2023 on HBO and Max. (HBO and Max share ownership with CNN.)  Without a streaming network of its own, licensing its intellectual property and original content is part of Sony’s strategy to compete with streaming giants like Netflix, Disney and Amazon.  Robert Lawson, the chief communications officer for Sony Group, said in a statement that since 2018 when the company acquired EMI publishing, making Sony Music the world’s largest publisher of music, Sony has invested approximately 1.5 trillion yen into content IP across various entertainment businesses.  “Sony Group has shifted its corporate strategies towards strengthening its creation and entertainment assets,” Lawson said, noting the company is focusing on “new collaborations between Sony sister companies,” including leaning heavily into the anime genre.  In the last fiscal year ending March, Sony’s entertainment business, which includes music, movies and games, accounted for 60% of total revenue. That’s double from a decade ago, when the entertainment business accounted for just 30% of total revenue.  A long road to dominance  Doubling down on entertainment represents a departure from Sony’s origins.  Before there was Sony, there was Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, founded in 1946 by Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka. The company released Japan’s first-ever magnetic tape record in 1950. In 1958, the company changed its name to Sony Corporation.  In the 1960s, Sony established its business in the United States. For the next three decades, the Japanese company emerged as a household name in consumer electronics, producing iconic devices from the Trinitron color TV in 1968 to the Walkman cassette player in 1979 to the world’s first CD player in 1982, in addition to numerous cameras and video recorders.  Sony has also been involved with music since the 1960s through a joint venture with CBS that became Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Yet it’s largely been known for its electronics.

Aflo/Shutterstock  The 1990s were a high point for Sony as it broke into the world of gaming consoles. With the release of the PlayStation in 1994, Sony disrupted the arcade and gaming industry.  Since the 1990s, Sony has been a dominant player in the videogame console business with iterations of the PlayStation. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, which has consistently outsold its main competitors like Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Nintendo’s Switch, according to data from Ampere Analysis, an analytics firm for the games business.  Van Dreunen said that Sony is also looking to evolve in gaming beyond its console business, looking for new audiences and methods of distribution.  “We’re currently going through a softer period in gaming, and so it really raises the stakes for companies like, what’s next?” he said. “How do you as the dominant console maker continue to innovate and continue to grow your business?”  An original PlayStation is pictured at a display of various memorabilia in the lobby of the Sony headquarters building in central Tokyo on November 27, 2024. December 3 this year marked the 30th anniversary of the first release of Japan's Sony PlayStation, transforming the world of video games. Richard A. Brooks/AFP/Getty Images  A customer walks away after purchasing the new Sony Playstation PS5 in Seoul on November 12, 2020, after Sony launched the new console in select markets around the world. Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images  Thong said that Sony has been successful in becoming a profitable channel for third-party publishers to sell videogames.  Sony has tried to diversify its strategy toward gaming, including publishing a videogame called Helldivers 2 across PlayStation5 and also PC. Helldivers 2 was a hit for Sony and sold over 12 million copies within three months of its release, according to Anna Kerr, a research manager for games at Ampere Analytics.  “The games business is spreading out its IP,” NYU Stern’s van Dreunen said. “It’s looking for new ways to reach customers, to expand that customer reach.”  In November, Sony announced a 69% percent jump in net quarterly profit, driven in part by its game segment. The company has had consistently strong quarters this year, driven by profitability in its games.  The company is now in talks to acquire Kadokawa, a Japanese videogame powerhouse that produces the popular videogame “Elden Ring,” according to people familiar with the matter.  There have been some headwinds: Sony’s rollout of the “Concord” vieogame and Sony Pictures’ latest installment of the Spider-Man universe were largely flops among fans this year. However, they are trial and error runs, van Dreunen said, and manageable expenditures for a company that has denoted 1.8 trillion yen ($11 billion) for acquisitions and stock buybacks through March 2027.  In May, at Sony’s annual investor conference, Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida said that the company was embracing a “creative entertainment vision.”  Sony’s emergence as an entertainment company was not always certain, Thong said.  “Sony had some years of quite substantial pain, I would say,” Thong said. “And I think to their credit, they managed to weather and see through it.”  Bringing Sony IP to the big screen  Van Dreunen said in the past, there wasn’t as much demand for videogame adaptations for movie and TV. Yet “The Last of Us” showed that Sony had an opportunity to bring more Sony IP to the big screen.  Before “The Last of Us,” Sony also tried its hand at videogame adaptation with “Uncharted,” a 2022 movie featuring actor Tom Holland that was based on a video game franchise first published by Sony in 2007.

Sony is still in the electronics business, Thong said, noting its image sensors business works with companies like Apple and it produces high-end cameras. However, it has shed its identity as a mass consumer electronics company.  In 2025, Sony intends to spin off its online banking and insurance units, further doubling down on its entertainment offerings.  Sony’s stock is up almost 18% in the past month, outpacing entertainment heavyweights like Disney and Netflix, and boosted from investors piling into the Nasdaq, which crossed 20,000 for the first time this week.",US,0.9996
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/business/unitedhealthcare-insurance-denials-change/index.html,CNN,left,International,UnitedHealth Group CEO: America’s health system is poorly designed,"CNN —  In his first public response to the consumer outcry following the fatal shooting of one of his top executives, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said Friday that the US health system “is not perfect” and that coverage decisions “are not well understood.”  “We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people’s frustrations with it,” Witty wrote in a guest essay in the New York Times. “No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It’s a patchwork built over decades.”  Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.  “Together with employers, governments and others who pay for care, we need to improve how we explain what insurance covers and how decisions are made,” Witty wrote. “Behind each decision lies a comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety.”  Witty also praised UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was killed in midtown Manhattan last week, writing that Thompson “fought for preventive health and quality health outcomes rather than simply adding ever more tests and procedures.”  In a statement on Friday, UnitedHealthcare said “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company’s treatment of insurance claims” and that it “approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission,” noting that “around one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons.”  Will changes be made?  Thompson’s fatal shooting pushed Americans’ dissatisfaction with their health insurance into the spotlight. Many have made their frustrations abundantly clear on social media.  Journalists have also chronicled insurers’ efforts to twist the system to their benefit. STAT, a news site that focuses on health care, has published a series of investigative stories on UnitedHealth, including articles on how the nation’s largest health insurer uses a computer algorithm to cut off rehabilitation care for Medicare enrollees, limiting clinical case managers’ discretion.  Whether the public outcry prompts UnitedHealthcare and other insurers to adjust their practices — particularly the much-maligned denials of treatment and claims — or pushes lawmakers to force the industry to make changes remains to be seen. It depends, in part, on whether patients continue making their voices heard, experts say.  Angry consumers have had success in overhauling the health insurance industry in the past. They railed against the restrictions of health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, in the 1990s, as captured in the 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” That helped spur insurers to offer more preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, which have fewer constraints but are more costly.  Any shifts in the nation’s complex health care system, however, will not come easily, nor quickly, experts say. There are many players involved, each of which has its own patient care concerns, financial interests and lobbying dollars to influence lawmakers.  UnitedHealthcare’s mission  While many patients and their advocates argue that insurers deny care to pad their profits, the industry maintains that it is protecting consumers from high prices and unnecessary care.  Soon after Thompson’s murder, Witty vowed in an internal message to employees to continue the insurer’s mission of helping “the system improve.”  “Our role is a critical role, and we make sure that care is safe, appropriate, and it’s delivered when people need it,” said Witty in a video message obtained by CNN. “And we guard against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex and ultimately unsustainable. So we’re going to continue to make that case.”  “What we know to be true is that the health system needs a company like UnitedHealth Group,” he continued.  Asked Thursday whether it will make any changes in response to consumers’ public complaints, UnitedHealthcare referred CNN to Witty’s video. Other major insurers either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment, but a leading industry association said that hospitals, providers and employers all have “a direct impact on the cost and accessibility of medical services.”  “In the fragmented and heavily regulated health care system, health plans, providers and drugmakers share a responsibility to make high-quality care as affordable as possible and easier to navigate for the people we collectively serve,” AHIP, the trade group, said in a statement. “Health plans are working to protect patients from the full impact of rising costs while connecting them to care that is safe, evidence-based and coordinated.”  But the recent events may prompt insurers to investigate their practices and make some changes, Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in an email to CNN. This is especially likely if they see risks to their businesses, such as if employers threaten to leave because coverage decisions are too onerous for their workers.  On the flip side, “the main reason to not change their practices is to maintain their profitability while also keeping costs reasonable in a broad sense for their clients and end users,” Utterback wrote.  Video Ad Feedback Scott Galloway says online rage directed at health care CEOs is directed at the wrong people. Hear why. 01:43 - Source: CNN  The HMO backlash  Though former President Bill Clinton failed to reform health care in the early 1990s, his administration’s efforts spurred increased concerns over the cost of care. That cued the growth of the HMO model, which allowed policyholders to see only certain doctors and required referrals from primary care physicians to see specialists and get certain tests and procedures. But HMOs also typically featured low premiums, low or no co-pays and no deductibles.  Policyholders rebelled because they felt they couldn’t access the care they needed, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.  Their angst was captured in extensive media coverage and in the 1997 film “As Good As It Gets,” when a young boy’s mother (played by Helen Hunt) tells a doctor (played by Harold Ramis) that her insurer would not cover an allergy test for her son’s asthma.  “F**king HMO, bastard pieces of sh*t,” Hunt says, before apologizing.  “That’s ok. Actually, I think that’s their technical name,” Ramis replies.  Many states responded to the complaints by passing patients’ bills of rights that limited HMO cost-control practices in state-regulated plans. Employers, who were hearing from angry workers, began shifting to PPOs, which generally provide coverage for a wider range of doctors but have much higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. PPOs have now largely eclipsed the managed care model.  But as health care costs continue to skyrocket, PPOs are instituting practices that resemble those of HMOs, particularly requiring approval of care in advance, known as prior authorization, Levitt said.  “If you think health care costs are rough now, imagine them without constraints,” said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+, a health care consulting group, and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.  Health insurers, however, do at times backtrack when faced with intense blowback. Earlier this month, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield halted its plan to limit the amount of time it would cover anesthesia used in surgeries and procedures after criticism from doctors and politicians. The policy was designed to reduce overbilling and make care more affordable, the insurer had said.  Efforts in Congress  Congress has tried for years to improve access to care and curtail costs, which are far higher in the US than in its peers even though it ranks last on key health measures. Lawmakers have held hearings and introduced bills, but there haven’t been comprehensive reforms enacted since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 — aside from several significant Medicare drug cost provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.  An effort to improve the prior authorization process in Medicare Advantage plans failed to advance in the Senate in 2022 after the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost about $16 billion over a decade.  However, there is now more bipartisan appetite on Capitol Hill to enact reforms, said Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive and vocal critic of the health care industry. Lawmakers reintroduced the prior authorization bill, which now comes with a zero cost estimate, and released a framework to establish so-called site-neutral payments in Medicare, under which Medicare would pay the same rate for a service provided in a hospital outpatient department, an ambulatory surgical center or physician’s office.  Plus, lawmakers are looking at reforms to the pharmacy benefit manager industry, which serves as a middleman between health insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers.  Republicans, who will control Congress starting in January, will be looking for cost savings to offset extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Whitlock said. That could push them to pass measures that would save the government money, such as site-neutral payments.  Meanwhile, the murder of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO will remain in the news as the case against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, winds its way through the court system. That will keep public frustration with health insurers in the spotlight – and could help advance legislation on Capitol Hill, Potter said.  “It will be a years long fight, but it’s going to happen,” he said. “Some kind of reform is inevitable.”",US,0.9982

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/wisconsin-kayaker-ryan-borgwardt-custody/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Wisconsin kayaker turned himself in after officials say he faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe,"CNN —  A Wisconsin man who officials say faked his own death and fled to Eastern Europe was charged with a misdemeanor count of obstructing an officer Wednesday after he turned himself in to authorities.  Ryan Borgwardt, who was reported missing in August, flew back to the United States willingly, arriving Tuesday, said Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll, who remained tight-lipped on why the man left his wife and three children by allegedly staging a kayaking accident, and where exactly he’s been for the past four months.  “He came back on his own,” said Podoll during a news conference Wednesday. When asked by the media why Borgwardt decided to return, Podoll added, “His family, I guess.”  Borgwardt’s wife filed a petition for legal separation on Thursday, Dodge County court documents show. In Wisconsin, a legal separation does not end a marriage, unlike a divorce, but allows the court to rule on the same issues that come up in a divorce proceeding.  In her petition, Borgwardt’s wife is requesting sole legal custody of their three teenage children, claiming the 22-year marriage is “irretrievably broken.”  Borgwardt appeared in court Wednesday and said he could not afford an attorney and offered to represent himself. Circuit Court Judge Mark T. Slate reminded the defendant he has the right to a court-appointed attorney and could request one if needed.  Slate entered a not guilty plea on Borgwardt’s behalf and ordered a $500 signature bond. Borgwardt has since bonded out of jail and is expected back in court on January 13, online court records show.  If convicted of the obstruction charge, Borgwardt faces a maximum penalty of a $10,000 fine and nine months in jail, Judge Slate said.  At the request of the prosecutor, Slate did not order but instead requested the media not share images of Borgwardt’s family members. He denied requests for a gag order in the case and for Borgwardt to surrender his passport.  Ryan Borgwardt's booking photo Green Lake County Sheriff  Podoll declined to share details of Borgwardt’s time away or whether he has been in touch with his family. The investigation involved a number of state and federal agencies including the FBI and Homeland Security, he added.  Borgwardt, 45, was reported missing August 12 after failing to return from a fishing trip on Green Lake, about an hour north of his home in Watertown, Wisconsin.  For seven weeks, the Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office searched for Borgwardt’s body with the help of trained volunteers but found only the man’s kayak and a tackle box containing a set of keys, a wallet and his license. Eventually, officials uncovered evidence that Borgwardt had fled to Europe by way of Canada.  Investigators made contact with the father of three on November 11, when they say they learned he executed a plan to fake his own death for a “number of reasons” unknown to the public.  Authorities communicated with Borgwardt almost daily, Podoll said during a news conference in late November, adding that Borgwardt appeared to be safe but had still not spoken to his family.  How Borgwardt ‘disappeared’  On the day he vanished, Borgwardt traveled to Green Lake – one of Wisconsin’s deepest inland lakes – with a plan to fake his own drowning, according to Podoll, who detailed the man’s scheme.  The experienced kayaker paddled out onto the water where he deliberately overturned the vessel, tossed his phone and returned to shore in a child-sized inflatable boat, Podoll said.  Borgwardt then rode an e-bike through the night about 80 miles to Madison, Wisconsin, where he then boarded a bus to Detroit, eventually crossing the Canadian border and flying to Europe, Podoll said.  Before his disappearance, Borgwardt transferred funds to a foreign bank account, changed his email and communicated with a woman in Uzbekistan, according to Podoll. A criminal complaint filed Wednesday said Borgwardt brought approximately $5,500 in cash with him.  Investigators were ultimately able to contact Borgwardt through a Russian-speaking woman, Podoll said, though he declined to say whether she was the woman he had been communicating with in Uzbekistan and whether he was with her.  Borgwardt told police he heavily researched how to disappear by looking up previous cases, and that “everything hinged on me dying in the lake” and the “whole idea was to sell the death,” the complaint said.  In January, Borgwardt took out a $375,000 life insurance policy, which Podoll said was intended to help his family.  “In our communications, we are expressing the importance of his decision to return home and clean up the mess that he has created,” Podoll said. Borgwardt has expressed regret for how he has hurt his family and “also feels bad about the amount of hours that we have put in the community,” the sheriff said.  The long, expansive search for Borgwardt was a costly and emotionally taxing endeavor for both his family and search crews, Podoll said.  Borgwardt’s family has experienced emotional whiplash after mourning him for weeks and then coming to terms with his purported abandonment, the sheriff said on “CNN News Central” last month.  Borgwardt previously told investigators he thought they would stop searching for him after about two weeks, officials said.  “He picked the wrong sheriff and the wrong department,” Podoll said.  The search for Borgwardt  On the morning of August 12, Borgwardt’s capsized kayak was found in the lake and his vehicle and trailer were found at a nearby park, Podoll said.  The following day, two fishermen casting along the lake found a fishing rod that belonged to Borgwardt, his wife told officials. A tackle box was found later that day with several of Borgwardt’s belongings: a set of keys, a wallet and his license.  In October, investigators learned from Canadian officials Borgwardt had entered the country on August 13.  Borgwardt’s passport was found at the family home, but learning he left the country gave investigators a break in the case and prompted them to search his computer and dig deeper, according to Podoll.  Investigators found Borgwardt had replaced the hard drive on his laptop and cleared his browser history on the day of his disappearance, Podoll said. He had also reported his passport stolen and obtained a replacement last spring.  Though the county will seek restitution for the taxpayer-funded search efforts, that does not include the thousands of dollars spent by the non-profit Bruce’s Legacy, which helped in the underwater search for Borgwardt’s body. Borgwardt told police he didn’t realize organizations like that existed, the complaint says.  Keith Cormican, director of Bruce’s Legacy, told CNN he spent nearly 30 days working on the case. The first two weeks of the search alone will cost him about $10,000 due to damaged equipment and other expenses, he said.  “My success rate is pretty good,” Cormican told CNN. “To not be able to find him … really had me questioning my abilities. And I lost a lot of sleep over it.”  CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe and Bill Kirkos contributed to this report.",US,-0.9964
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process with the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items which may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  FBI: San Francisco police recognized suspect  On Friday, the FBI told CNN they received a tip from the San Francisco Police Department, saying an officer with the department’s Special Victims Unit had recognized Mangione as a possible suspect on December 5 after seeing the surveillance photos of the suspect’s unmasked face.  The San Francisco Chronicle first reported on the tip Thursday.  Chronicle reporter Megan Cassidy told CNN’s John Berman her team reported “a few days ago” on the existence of a missing persons report in San Francisco for Mangione.  “Apparently, there was somebody at SFPD that was looking into the missing persons case, and after the shooting of Brian Thompson, recognized this person and called in this tip, or emailed this tip, to the FBI,” Cassidy said.  The FBI then sent the tip to New York investigators during the manhunt, the agency told CNN.  CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explained on Friday’s “AC360” how the tip ultimately made its way to the FBI in New York and the NYPD.  “This tip comes from, I think, a victim witness specialist in the San Francisco Police Department who had that missing persons case somewhere in front of them and looked at that face and says, ‘Gee, that could be the guy that is on these FBI posters all over town,’ so SFPD sends that to San Francisco FBI,” Miller said.  “San Francisco FBI says, ‘that’s a New York office case,’” he added.  Miller explained the FBI’s New York office likely sent the information to a violent crimes squad composed of a mix of FBI agents and NYPD officers.  “They look at it and they do a workup on the name, checking, you know, any indicators that guy’s been in New York, and then they send it over to NYPD,” Miller said.  By Sunday, the tip joined 200 viable leads being examined by authorities, according to Miller.  “Then Monday morning, at 9:15 in the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, another tip leads to the capture,” he said. “So you see, these leads are piling up, being tasked out and being worked, and this was in that pile coming up because it was a viable lead. It’s just that destiny took a hand quicker.”  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.",US,-0.9995

CNN —  I’m not much of a hugger. Sure, I’ll bust out the warm fuzzies for relatives around the holidays but I’m not like, say, my best friend, who prefers her hugs to produce the bone-liquifying pressure of an industrial vise. My husband loves to tell the story of our first date, when he approached me with open arms and I maneuvered him into a firm, businesslike handshake. Touch is just not my love language! And if you’re also not a hugger, the holidays are a gauntlet of outstretched arms and sweatered bosoms and unfamiliar colognes. We’ll make it through together! I recently watched some interviews with the lead actresses of the new “Wicked” film (which is sooo so good), and each tends to clutch the other’s single beautifully taloned finger when things get deep. I do that too! It is emotionally supportive without being suffocating (literally or figuratively). Fingertip-to-fingertip touching is the new hugging, pass it on.  Here’s all the good things that happened this week.  Nana Kyei  1. The Friendship Queen Diaries  It’s like something out of a movie: Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in 1996. Now, she’s a queen in Ghana. Despite her challenging youth, Johnson made sure she and her daughter were well-traveled, and after discovering she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, she founded a travel company to organize trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Her work attracted the attention of the Dakpema, a governing body in northern Ghana. She was blown away when they asked her to accept the title of “Zosimli Naa,” or “Friendship Queen.” The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the centuries-old Dagbon Kingdom, which comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in the city of Tamale, where she now lives. “We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.  CNN  2. Fabric of rebirth  The iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is finally open to the public again after a devastating fire damaged it five years ago. As part of this rebirth, fashion designer and artist Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was asked to create new vestments, or special service garments, for the cathedral’s clergy. Vestments are an important part of a church’s identity and de Castelbajac said the theme for the new look was “noble simplicity.” The designer drew inspiration from Notre Dame’s stained glass and blonde stone, creating a look that he said speaks to tradition and innovation; old and new. The vision was “radiant with color, radiant of hope, radiant of faith,” de Castelbajac told CNN. You can see details of the vestments in the photo above, and learn more about de Castelbajac’s process in this video.  CNN  3. Music on the brain  If you’ve ever shared your life with someone with dementia or another progressive neurological disease, you know music can be magic. Toronto-based company LUCID is combining facial mapping software, artificial intelligence, and music to create a therapy for older patients dealing with health challenges like Alzheimer’s, dementia and even depression and anxiety. The treatment involves measuring how a person’s brain reacts to music and combining that with facial mapping and artificial intelligence. Using this data, the technology can create specific playlists that hopefully can alleviate stress, restlessness, confusion and emotional discomfort in dementia patients.  Natalia Botero-Acosta  4. I would swim 500 miles  This whale puts The Proclaimers to shame! A male humpback whale has completed an extraordinary record-breaking migration, swimming more than 8,000 miles from South America to Africa. The humpback was first spotted off the coast of Colombia in 2013 and seen again a few years later not far from its original location. But in 2022, the whale was unexpectedly detected in the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa. The typical migration route for humpback whales can approach 5,000 miles in a single direction, making this one’s journey close to two times that of most whales. The discovery also marks the first documentation of an adult male humpback traveling between the Pacific and Indian oceans.

She co-founded the award-winning restaurant Takya, located in the 600-year-old historic center of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. Though the food has all the artfully prepared aura of a high-class restaurant, the menu is inspired by the traditional home cooking Al Motawa grew up with, and by her travels around Saudi Arabia and abroad. After seeing the deep connection between food and culture, Al Motawa wanted to “bring that same connection back home, to create a space where people could rediscover the beauty of Saudi cuisine.” Saudi Arabia itself is a country of great geographical, and thus culinary, diversity. For example, the Eastern Province is known for its seafood, such as Muhammar, a fried fish dish made with rice and sugar that was traditionally popular among sailors. In the country’s northern region, where temperatures are cooler and may drop below freezing during winter, traditional recipes focus on grains and meat, like the popular jareesh, a lamb stew made with wheat and yogurt.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Downtown San Francisco experiences first tornado warning in recorded history,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said. Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and about 300 miles northwest of Sacramento.",US,-0.989
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/crystal-mangum-duke-lacrosse-allegations/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Duke lacrosse scandal: Crystal Mangum admits to false rape allegations,"CNN —  More than 18 years after accusing three former Duke University lacrosse players of raping her, a falsified account she shared in graphic detail, Crystal Mangum has admitted she lied about the encounter.  In an interview on a web show published Wednesday, Mangum apologized to the men and said her relationship with God has made her understand why she fabricated the story. Mangum is serving time in prison on a second-degree murder conviction for killing her boyfriend.  The timeline of the North Carolina case begins in 2006, when Mangum said she was trapped inside a bathroom, sexually assaulted and raped by David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann at a team party where she was performing as an exotic dancer. The men were arrested following her allegations.  “I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn’t, and that was wrong. And I betrayed the trust of a lot of other people who believed in me,” Mangum said on Katerena DePasquale’s show, “Let’s Talk with Kat.” “I made up a story that wasn’t true because I wanted validation from people and not from God.”  David Evans, left, Collin Finnerty, center, and Reade Seligmann, right, look on during a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2007. Chuck Burton/AP/File  For more than a year, the school and the lacrosse players were thrust into a media frenzy, subjected to intense public scrutiny and damaging allegations of sexual assault that were ultimately dropped.  After Mangum’s confession, Duke told CNN on Friday it would not comment. The former players did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.  Here’s how the events unfolded.  A timeline of the events  • March 13, 2006: Mangum is hired as a dancer for a private party held by members of the Duke men’s lacrosse team. It takes place at a house on North Buchanan Boulevard in Durham. Mangum later accuses several players of raping her during the party early on March 14.  • March 28, 2006: Duke President Richard Brodhead suspends team play for the men’s lacrosse team, a move widely criticized as premature since no formal charges had been made yet. Media attention intensifies, with early reports painting a picture of privileged, White lacrosse players being accused by a Black woman. The case becomes a flashpoint for issues of race, class and privilege, according to the Washington Post.  • March 28-30, 2006: DNA tests on Mangum’s body fail to link any of the lacrosse players to the scene, according to a disciplinary order against prosecutor Mike Nifong by the North Carolina State Bar, but Nifong insists on moving forward with the case. Skepticism about the case begins to mount.  • April 18, 2006: Nifong formally charges Seligmann and Finnerty with rape, according to the disciplinary order. The charges are based largely on Mangum’s testimony, as forensic evidence was either inconclusive or absent.  • May 15, 2006: Nifong formally charges Evans with rape, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 5, 2006: Duke announces the lacrosse team is reinstated to play in the following fall, but public sentiment has already soured.  • December 28, 2006: Nifong is accused of withholding evidence and making misleading statements to the press, leading to an investigation by the state bar, according to the disciplinary order.  • April 11, 2007: Roy Cooper – then the state’s Attorney General and now its governor – announces “there is insufficient evidence to proceed on any of the charges” in a statement shared by Duke Athletics. The charges are dropped.  “We believe that these cases were the result of a tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations,” Cooper said. “Based on the significant inconsistencies between the evidence and the various accounts given by the accusing witness, we believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges.”  • June 16, 2007: Nifong loses his law license following disciplinary hearings about his handling of the case, including accusations of ethical misconduct and withholding evidence. His disbarment is finalized by the state bar in July, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 18, 2007: Duke announces that it has settled with the three lacrosse players, agreeing to pay a confidential settlement.  “It is impossible to fully describe what we, our families and team endured. As we said from day one, we are innocent,” Evans, Finnerty and Seligmann said in a statement. “But it took three hundred and ninety-four days, and the intervention of the North Carolina Attorney General, before our innocence was formally declared.”  • October 5, 2007: The three players file a civil lawsuit against the city of Durham, Nifong and other individuals, according to court documents. Durham later settles the lawsuit in part with a one-time grant of $50,000 to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.  • April 3, 2011: Mangum is charged with stabbing her boyfriend, leading to a lengthy criminal trial, and is convicted of second-degree murder in 2013.  ‘I hope they can forgive me’  Mangum has spent 11 years in prison, which she is getting through by reading the Bible and finding humor in her thoughts, she said in her interview with “Let’s Talk with Kat.”  She wishes she could help children who were sexually abused, she told DePasquale. When asked if she could describe her experience in prison in one word, she says: “Growth.”  Before becoming an exotic dancer, she studied psychology at North Carolina Central University. The transition came from her searching for “validation,” she said in the interview.  “I was looking for love and acceptance from people,” she said. “People to love me, to accept me, to pay attention to me for validation. But you can get all of that in Jesus. He loves us just the way we are. That’s what I learned in prison.  “I hurt my brothers and I hope they can forgive me and I want them to know that I love them and they didn’t deserve that and I hope they can forgive me. I hope they can heal.”  The danger of false rape allegations for actual victims  An advocate for victims of sexual assault said rare cases like this might discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and cause people to wrongly doubt them.  “False reports hurt not only the people falsely accused, they hurt every rape victim,” Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, vice president of communications for RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, told CNN. “There are already too many victims who do not report the crime for fear of not being believed. After a false report in such a high-profile case, even more survivors may be reluctant to come forward out of fear that law enforcement will not believe them.”  A study published by Violence Against Women in 2010 found that false sexual assault reports range from between 2 to 10 percent. A majority of sexual assaults, an estimated 63 percent, are never reported to the police, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.  Kaleba said she encourages people to consider the nearly half million victims in the US of rape and sexual assault each year who may now face renewed disbelief and question the value of reporting sexual violence.  “Don’t allow infrequent, false reporting to stand in the way of standing with survivors,” Kaleba said.",US,-0.9993
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor.",US,-0.9676
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/kirstin-lobato-las-vegas-verdict/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Las Vegas jury awards $34 million to woman falsely accused of murder,"Las Vegas AP —  A federal jury in Nevada has awarded more than $34 million to a woman who was arrested at age 18, wrongly convicted twice, and served nearly 16 years in a Nevada state prison for a 2001 killing she did not commit.  Kirstin Lobato, who is now 41 and uses the name Blaise, cried and hugged her attorneys after a judge read the trial verdict Thursday in US District Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  “It’s been an uphill battle with many, many obstacles,” she told reporters. “And I’m happy that it’s all finally finished.”  Lobato said she didn’t know if becoming a millionaire would make up for years in prison, adding that she had “no idea what the rest of my life is going to look like.”  The civil trial jury found Las Vegas police and two detectives, now retired, fabricated evidence during their investigation and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Lobato. The panel determined that Lobato should receive $34 million in compensatory damages from the department and $10,000 in punitive damages from each former detective.  The detectives, Thomas Thowsen and James LaRochelle, and their attorney, Craig Anderson, declined to comment outside court. Anderson told US District Judge Richard Boulware he planned to file additional court documents following the verdict. Anderson said Friday an appeal was “likely.”  The department previously agreed to pay damages if the jury ruled in Lobato’s favor.  Lobato was 18 when she was interviewed by police without an attorney, arrested and charged with killing Duran Bailey in Las Vegas in July 2001. Bailey, who had been homeless, was found dead near a trash bin with a slashed neck, cracked skull and missing genitals.  No physical evidence or witnesses connected Lobato to the killing, and she maintained she never met Bailey. But police maintained she confessed in jail that she had killed a man who tried to rape her during a three-day methamphetamine binge.  Lobato was 19 when she was convicted of murder in 2002. The Nevada Supreme Court threw out that verdict and Lobato’s prison sentence in 2004 because her lawyers weren’t able to cross-examine a prosecution witness who testified that Lobato made the jailhouse confession.  Lobato was tried again in 2006, convicted of manslaughter, mutilation and weapon charges, and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.  She was exonerated and freed from prison in late 2017 after the Innocence Project and attorneys in Las Vegas again took her case to the state Supreme Court. Justices said evidence showed that Lobato was in her hometown of Panaca, Nevada, some 150 miles from Las Vegas when Bailey was killed.  Last October, a state court judge in Las Vegas issued a certificate declaring Lobato innocent of Bailey’s killing.  That action was challenged by Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson in a letter asking state Attorney General Aaron Ford to investigate how and why attorneys for Lobato acquired the certificate of innocence.  Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled Kirstin Lobato’s first name.",US,-0.9948
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/baby-garnet-cold-case-michigan/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Baby Garnet cold case update: A DNA test helped solve a 1997 Michigan murder,"CNN —  It was the middle of Jenna Gerwatowski’s workday at the local flower shop in Newberry, Michigan, when she got a call from an unknown number.  The now 23-year-old doesn’t usually answer unknown calls, but says she decided to pick this one up in May 2022.  To her surprise, it was a detective from the Michigan state police.  “He was like, ‘Have you heard of the Baby Garnet case?’” Jenna told CNN.  Jenna had heard of it. In 1997, a deceased infant was found in a campground pit toilet at the Garnet Lake Campground – right where Jenna grew up. Investigators couldn’t find any leads on the identity of the baby or anyone who witnessed a person abandoning an infant, according to a news release from the Michigan attorney general’s office. The case went cold, and the “Baby Garnet” case became a known murder mystery in Jenna’s small town for decades.  “Your DNA was a match,” Jenna says the detective on the phone told her. She was related to the dead infant from 1997.  Jenna was in shock. The detective sounded sure, Jenna said, but she wondered how he had even obtained her DNA.  About six months earlier, her friend had gotten a FamilyTreeDNA test for Christmas and Jenna decided to order her own. DNA from other Baby Garnet relatives led detectives to Jenna’s FamilyTreeDNA kit, according to court documents.  Jenna Gerwatowski, left, says the case was always a big mystery in her town. She had no idea the grandmother she'd never met, Nancy Gerwatowski, right, could be behind it. Jenna Rose Gerwatowski/Mackinac County Sheriff's Office  The detective said a woman from Identifinders International, a genetic genealogy investigation firm, would call her about her DNA to help with identifying closer relatives, according to Jenna.  According to court documents, detectives reopened the cold case in 2017 and then worked with a forensics company to extract DNA from Baby Garnet’s partial femur, before sending the results to Identifinders International.  Jenna explained the situation to her mother when she got home from work.  “It was just crazy,” Jenna said. “We were both sitting there like, I don’t even know who (the mother or father) could’ve been. We were both so confused and we’re like, it’s got to be somebody that we don’t know, you know, like a distant cousin or something.”  Jenna said her mother, Kara Gerwatowski, started to wonder whether the detective call was a scam.  Jenna’s grandfather had just been scammed by someone claiming to be a detective, so Kara told Jenna to be cautious about giving out personal information or passwords.  Misty Gillis, then a senior forensic genealogist and cold case liaison from Identifinders International, called Jenna that night, according to Jenna and court documents filed later in the case.  Jenna claims Gillis requested her FamilyTreeDNA password to be able to upload her DNA into a separate database. Jenna was concerned it was a scammer and refused to cooperate, according to court documents.  “I hung up the phone on her, not even thinking twice about it. And we went about our day. I was like, how weird. What a weird thing to scam people about,” Jenna said. “I wholeheartedly did not think that it was real.”  One week later, Jenna was working at the flower shop when she got a distressed call from her mother.  “She was like, ‘I really need you to come home. … It’s an emergency. Like, just please come as soon as you can,’” Jenna said.  Jenna rushed home thinking someone died. Her cousin was sitting with her mom at their round wooden kitchen table. Police had contacted her cousin, who works as a victim’s advocate in the county prosecutor’s office, to explain the Baby Garnet situation to Jenna. It turned out it wasn’t a scam.  “My mom had tears in her eyes,” she said. Jenna’s cousin had “just pure shock on her face. … You could hear a pin drop in there.”  Even though Jenna knew she had nothing to do with the Baby Garnet case, she was terrified police would think she was trying to hide something because of her refusal to speak with Gillis. She immediately called her.  An analysis of Jenna’s DNA kit showed she was the half-niece to Baby Garnet, according to court records.  On June 1, 2022, detectives spoke with her mother, Kara, who agreed to provide her DNA. Kara was the half-sister of Baby Garnet, according to court records.  “I feel like that is when, like, all of the puzzle pieces kind of started falling together for her,” Jenna said. “And she told detectives that, if it’s going to be anybody, it would be (her) mother.”  Kara, now 42, had not spoken with her mother, Nancy Gerwatowski, since she was 18 because they had a bad relationship, and Jenna had never met her grandmother. Regardless, both were shocked Nancy, who was living in Wyoming when police questioned her, would be the one behind their town mystery.  “I had grown up knowing about the case my whole life and then come to find out it was my grandma that did it?” Jenna said.  The Michigan attorney general’s office alleges Nancy “delivered the newborn alone at her Newberry home, during which Baby Garnet died due to asphyxiation, and that this death could have been prevented by medical intervention (Nancy) Gerwatowski did not seek.”  However, in a court filing, Nancy’s defense argues she unexpectedly gave birth while in the bathtub and the fetus “became trapped inside her birth canal.” She “attempted to pull the fetus out of her own body,” the filing says, but couldn’t deliver the fetus and lost consciousness “at some point in the delivery.” When she was finally able to deliver the fetus, it was dead, the filing says.  Her defense argues that Nancy, like the average person in the county in 1997, did not have access to a telephone or cell line, so she couldn’t call 911. While she concedes in her legal filings she placed the stillborn fetus in a bag and left the remains at the campground, her defense attorneys argue she had been in shock after having had no pain medication during the traumatic birth.  Nancy is charged with one count each of open murder, involuntary manslaughter, and concealing the death of an individual. Open murder carries a potential life sentence.  In a hearing on Thursday, Nancy’s defense argued that the case against her should be dropped in its entirety because the state cannot prove the baby was born alive. If the court allows the case to proceed, the defense argued, Nancy’s statements during police interrogation should be excluded because she was denied her right to counsel — a contention the state disputed. If the court does allow her statements to be a part of the trial, Nancy’s lawyers want her comments about considering an abortion and not seeking out prenatal care to be excluded, while the state argued the comments are relevant to possible motive.  Judge Brian D. Rahilly said he hopes to reach a decision on whether or not to drop the charges by next week or around the end of the year at the latest.  “It was a very hard time … very traumatizing and very nerve-wracking,” said Jenna. “I’ve never met this woman, so it was hard for me to even grasp that concept, but even harder for my mom because that was her mother.”",US,-0.9991
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-thursday-hnk/index.html,CNN,left,Business,UnitedHealthCare CEO shooting: Suspect Luigi Mangione now faces mounting evidence,"CNN —  Marked shell casings from the assassination scene match the gun found on the suspect. His fingerprints match some key items investigators found nearby. And he was arrested this week – after going silent from his mom and friends for months – with a fake ID and a handwritten “claim of responsibility” referencing the crime site.  These details and others, shared by law enforcement and people who know suspect Luigi Mangione, have been mounting since last week’s daylight killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a busy sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of the investigation into Thompson’s killing, sources tell CNN.  A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN at least two of the warrants include the backpack found in Central Park and the burner phone found along the getaway route police believe Mangione took from the shooting scene. Investigators also searched the hostel where suspected killer Mangione stayed the night before the shooting and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  After a five-day, multi-state manhunt that leaned heavily on surveillance images and pleas for the public’s help, Mangione, 26, is now charged in the case with murder after a tip led to his arrest Monday at a McDonald’s nearly 200 miles from where the brazen homicide unfolded.  Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury in the case against Mangione, sources told ABC News.  Mangione was charged in a felony arrest warrant earlier this week. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  Blair County Judge David Consiglio scheduled a hearing in Pennsylvania on December 30 in response to Mangione’s petitions for writ of habeas corpus and imposition of bail, court documents from Thursday show.  Mangione was denied bail on Tuesday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania. The habeas corpus petition is a key factor in whether the suspect can be extradited to New York.  Mangione’s team was given two weeks from Tuesday to file the habeas corpus petition, which challenges Pennsylvania’s ability to prove that Mangione is the person the state of New York has issued the arrest warrant for, according to Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.  Mangione is also set to appear in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, court on December 23 for a preliminary hearing related to state charges.  Mangione’s lawyer has denied his client’s involvement in the December 4 killing and anticipates he will plead not guilty to the murder and other charges in New York, as well as to charges related to the 3D-printed gun and fake ID in Pennsylvania, where he was caught and is being held without bond.  Defense attorney Thomas Dickey on Wednesday also dismissed the ballistics and fingerprint evidence revealed publicly hours earlier, saying he wants to examine it himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”  Thomas Dickey, attorney for suspected shooter Luigi Mangione, speaks Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “As lawyers, we need to see it. We need to see: How did they collect it? How much of it? And then we would have our experts … take a look at that, and then we would challenge its admissibility and challenge the accuracy of those results.”  Still, New York’s governor expects a murder indictment “to be issued any day now, and the second that happens, I’m issuing a warrant for extradition.”  “It feels like the evidence is very compelling,” Gov. Kathy Hochul told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. “I trust the DA here in Manhattan to make sure that he puts forth an indictment that is going to be iron-clad.”  Meanwhile, Hochul is unimpressed by the folk hero status Mangione has attained on social media as the killing of Thompson – a husband and father of two – has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry.  Mangione appears to have been driven by anger against the industry and “corporate greed” as a whole, states a New York Police Department intelligence report that also warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  “That horrific attack occurred on our streets,” Hochul said Thursday. “And the people of our city deserve to have that sense of calm that this perpetrator has been caught, and he will be never seeing the late of day again if there is justice.”  “You cannot assassinate an individual on the streets of New York – not now, not ever.”  Neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said on Thursday.  Suspect hadn’t spoken to mother since July  Until he was found Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Mangione had gone quiet from at least a few people who appear to have been close with him. The scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, he had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  Mangione’s mother had reported him missing November 18 – two weeks before Thompson’s killing – a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. She called police in San Francisco, where she knew her son had been living, and told authorities she’d called his phone repeatedly to find the voicemail full and not taking any more messages.  Mangione’s mom had no reason to believe her son was a danger to himself or others, she told the San Francisco Police Department, but she hadn’t actually spoken with him since July 1, the official said. He had worked remotely at TrueCar, she also said, where the phone was disconnected and the offices closed, the official added.  It also doesn’t appear Mangione had posted anything since midsummer to social media, where posts addressed to his X account suggest some of his friends have been trying to get in touch with him.  In July, a user tweeted at Mangione, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding. In late November, just weeks before the shooting, another user posted at Mangione, “thinking of you and prayers everyday in your name. Know you are missed and loved.”  As Mangione entered a Pennsylvania courthouse this week, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, he yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Suspected shooter Luigi Mangione is led from the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “He’s irritated, agitated about what’s happening to him and what he’s being accused of,” Dickey told CNN of Mangione’s outburst and struggle with police.  “He never had any legal representation until he walked into that building yesterday. And I talked to him … look at the difference between when he went in and when he came out … now he has a spokesperson and someone that’s going to fight for him.”  Suspect linked to fingerprints and gun  Police in New York on Wednesday publicly revealed the first positive forensic match and direct physical evidence tying Mangione to Thompson’s killing, law enforcement officials told CNN.  “We got the gun in question back from Pennsylvania. It’s now at the NYPD crime lab,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “We were able to match that gun to the three shell casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of the homicide.”  A 3D-printed gun was in Mangione’s possession when he was arrested Monday, police have said.  The three 9 mm shell casings had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, one word per bullet, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Police have been looking into whether those words, which match the title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry, may point to a motive in the killing.  Authorities also had been probing DNA material and a partial fingerprint from a discarded Starbucks water bottle and an energy bar wrapper surveillance images showed the suspect buying about 30 minutes before the shooting. Mangione’s fingerprints were confirmed as a match, Tisch said  Along with the prints and ballistics, investigators have been examining writings police have said Mangione had upon arrest, including a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility.” It did not include specific threats but indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday.  In some writings, he referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny added. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  Investigators also are looking at the suspect’s writing in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.  It included to-do lists to facilitate a killing, as well as notes justifying those plans, the source said. In one notebook passage, Mangione wrote about the late Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber who justified a deadly bombing campaign as an effort to protect against the onslaught of technology and exploitation. Mangione had written about the Unabomber in online posts as well.  In a notebook passage, Mangione concludes using a bomb against his intended victim “could kill innocents” and shooting would be more targeted, musing what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.

The statement did not indicate where Kobayashi was or how the family determined she was safe.  The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement they are “happy to learn that Hannah has been found safe” and due to the new information “this has become a private matter and we will wrap up our investigation.”  The family had launched a GoFundMe that raised over $47,000 to help find Hannah. Donations have been turned off, and donors who would like a refund can submit a claim, the family said.  Hannah Kobayashi arrived at Los Angeles International Airport from Maui on November 8, but did not board her connecting flight to New York, her sister previously told CNN. The family last heard from the 30-year-old on November 11 after spending four days in Los Angeles at various locations, according to video footage and photos.  Video Ad Feedback A timeline of Hannah Kobayashi's last-known locations 03:14 - Source: CNN  Video footage shows Hannah Kobayashi retrieving her luggage from baggage claim at LAX on November 11 after she requested it be returned from New York, and she then traveled via LA Metro to Union Station where she used her passport and cash to purchase a ticket that took her to the US-Mexico border, police said. She was declared a missing person on November 15.  More than three weeks after she left Maui, Los Angeles police declared her as a voluntary missing person on December 2. Video surveillance from US Customs and Border Protection “clearly shows” Hannah Kobayashi crossing the US-Mexico border just after noon on November 12 at the San Ysidro port of entry, police said.  “To date the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a news conference. “She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her.”  Volunteers put up flyers of missing Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi outside Crypto.com Arena in Downtown Los Angeles. Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images/File  Before leaving Maui, investigators found Hannah Kobayashi had expressed a desire to disconnect from modern technology, police said.  Tragedy struck the family during their search for Hannah Kobayashi when her father Ryan Kobayashi, who had traveled from Hawaii to Los Angeles to help look for her, was found dead November 24 near the airport, having taken his own life, the family and authorities say.  Hannah Kobayashi’s aunt, Larie Pidgeon, told CNN that he “died of a broken heart.”  This story has been updated with additional information.",US,-0.8042

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/louisville-police-reform-breonna-taylor/index.html,CNN,left,Business,"DOJ, Louisville reach deal after probe prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor","Louisville, Kentucky AP —  The US Justice Department and the city of Louisville have reached an agreement to reform the city’s police force after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, officials said Thursday.  The consent decree, which must be approved by a judge, follows a federal investigation that found Louisville police have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the “historic content decree” will build upon and accelerate, this transformational police reform we have already begun in Louisville.” He noted that “significant improvements” have already been implemented since Taylor’s death in March 2020. That includes a city law banning the use of “no-knock” warrants.  The Justice Department report released in March 2023 said the Louisville police department “discriminates against Black people in its enforcement activities,” uses excessive force and conducts searches based on invalid warrants. It also said the department violates the rights of people engaged in protests.  “This conduct harmed community members and undermined public trust in law enforcement that is essential for public safety,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This consent decree marks a new day for Louisville.”  Once the consent decree is agreed upon, a federal officer will monitor the progress made by the city.  The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened 12 civil rights investigations into law enforcement agencies, but this is the first that has reached a consent decree. The Justice Department and the city of Springfield, Massachusetts announced an agreement in 2022 but the investigation into that police department was opened under President Donald Trump’s first administration.  City officials in Memphis have taken a different approach, pushing against the need for a Justice Department consent decree to enact reforms in light of a federal investigation launched after Tyre Nichols’ killing that found Memphis officers routinely use unwarranted force and disproportionately target Black people. Memphis officials have not ruled eventually agreeing to a consent decree, but have said the city can make changes more effectively without committing to a binding pact.  It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department’s priorities around civil rights.",US,0.9902
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Business,New Jersey drones: Lawmakers meet with security officials after weeks of unexplained sightings,"CNN —  Weeks of mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey are prompting heightened security concerns – and mounting frustrations – from residents, military personnel and federal, state and local officials.  While the state’s governor says there’s no threat to public safety, other state officials and local mayors are alarmed.  “I’m legitimately concerned for what the hell is going on because nobody knows,” state Assemblyman Brian Bergen told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey after a briefing at state police headquarters on Wednesday.  “We are literally being invaded by drones. We have no idea who is doing it and where they’re coming from,” Pequannock Mayor Ryan Herb told the station after the briefing.  Law enforcement has not identified the origin or landing sites of the drones, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday. He added that the drones primarily operate at night, often displaying flashing lights, but they turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached.  According to Melham, the drones have eluded radar detection, possibly because they do not emit frequencies or possess evasion capabilities.  He also raised alarm over where some of the drones have been spotted.  “One of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey’s critical infrastructure,” Melham said.  The mayor of West Milford, Michele Dale, reported 60 drones hovering over local reservoirs.  Some members of Congress have speculated that a foreign entity may be involved in the drones, something the Pentagon rebuffed Wednesday.  The denial came hours after US Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, told Fox News the drones were from “a mothership” from Iran that is “off the East Coast of the United States of America.”  “There is not any truth to that,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.”  Meanwhile, US Northern Command, which oversees the Defense Department’s homeland security efforts, said in statement Wednesday that it had “conducted a deliberate analysis of the events” regarding the drone sightings but had not been asked “to assist with these events.”  A spokesperson for the US Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged an encounter by one of its assets with the drones.  “Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  The aircraft were not seen as an immediate threat and did not interfere with operations, Pinneo added.  CNN reached out to the Coast Guard but did not receive an immediate response.  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told WBGO on Wednesday the public should feel secure while acknowledging their fears.  “Based on everything we know, there is no public safety risks we’re aware of,” Murphy said.  “Is it frustrating to have no answers? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes,” the governor told the radio station.  The sightings began November 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. At times, large drones — some up to 6 feet in diameter — were seen nightly in New Jersey from dusk until 11 p.m., with sightings ranging from 4 to 180, according to state lawmakers who attended the briefing Wednesday.  The drones operate in a coordinated manner, turning off their lights to evade detection, complicating tracking efforts. They are not identified as hobbyist drones or linked to the Department of Homeland Security, State Assembly member Dawn Fantasia said on X.  The FBI is leading the investigation with the New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, while the US Coast Guard is assessing jurisdictional responses.  Federal agencies have ruled out any connections of local, state, or federal governments to the sightings.  Melham called for a temporary flight ban on all personnel and commercial drones in his video update, despite official advisories against such measures.  Concerns escalated after drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to military officials and state lawmakers. The sightings prompted the FAA to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.  Unnerved residents have described frequently seeing the drones hovering overhead, sometimes traveling in clusters.  While visiting family in New Jersey, travel content creator Katie Caf initially doubted reports of drones until she spotted several moving in a “zigzagging” pattern on Saturday. The 29-year-old noticed five potential drones, which she described as being the size of a bicycle. “They’re so weird looking and they’re much bigger than normal drones. I get why everyone is freaking out now … I think it’s kinda spooky.”  Fantasia said on X that the briefing occurred Wednesday at the New Jersey State Police headquarters and included descriptions of the aircraft’s movements and federal agencies’ response.  Though Murphy has said there is no known threat to the public, Fantasia and other local leaders have expressed doubt and are demanding more transparency into the investigation.  US Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, pushed for more information from federal investigators in a letter sent Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  “I recognize the need to maintain operational security of ongoing investigations and that this situation requires complex interagency coordination,” Booker wrote. “However, there is a growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state – from constituents and local officials alike – despite assurances that the drones pose no known threats to public safety.”  The FBI in Newark has asked the public to report any information related to the drones, including in several areas along the Raritan River.  “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI field office in Newark said December 3.  During a US Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday, Robert Wheeler, assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, called the phenomenon “concerning” but said “there is nothing that is known” that would lead him to identify a public safety risk.  CNN has sought more information from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and New Jersey State Police.  This story has been updated with additional information.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/university-of-mississippi-student-killing-mistrial/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee: Judge declares mistrial after jury deadlocks over killing of gay University of Mississippi student,"AP —  A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the case of Sheldon “Timothy” Herrington Jr. in the 2022 killing of Jimmie “Jay” Lee, a gay man who was prominent in the LGBTQ+ community at the University of Mississippi.  Jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict after over nine and a half hours of deliberation.  Lee’s body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead.  Herrington, 24, showed little emotion as he left the courtroom with his attorneys and several relatives. He remains free on bond and is still charged with capital murder, which Mississippi law defines as a killing committed along with another felony — in this case, kidnapping. Prosecutors had said they would not seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison if he is tried again and convicted.  Jurors on Wednesday were told they could also consider lesser charges of first-degree murder, punishable by life in prison; second-degree murder, 20 years to life; or manslaughter, up to 20 years.  University of Mississippi student Jimmie ""Jay"" Lee is seen in this undated image. Oxford Police Police Department  Circuit Judge Kelly Luther said he will consult with prosecutors and defense attorneys about setting another trial.  Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee, 20, was pursuing a master’s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.  Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, where the university is located and the trial was held.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee vanished. Investigators testified that they used warrants to obtain electronic records including explicit messages between social media accounts belonging to the two men and online searches conducted by Herrington, including one inquiring how long it takes to strangle someone.  Prosecutors said during closing arguments Wednesday that Herrington and Lee had a sexual encounter that ended badly and Lee left Herrington’s apartment. They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex. Prosecutors said Lee was killed after going back.  “Tim Herrington lived a lie — lived a lie to his family,” District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. “He lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.”  Herrington’s attorney, Kevin Horan, has said prosecutors cannot prove Lee is dead without having a body. He told jurors Wednesday that text messages showed Herrington did not lure Lee to his apartment.

Bruce Newman/Pool/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal/AP  “He’s the one that’s being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,” Horan said of Lee.  Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.  Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained explicit messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.  Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched “how long does it take to strangle someone” at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.  The final text message from Lee’s phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington’s apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee’s phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee’s car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.  On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.  Herrington’s relatives sat behind him in the courtroom, and Lee’s sat behind prosecutors. When Luther dismissed court after the mistrial, he instructed the two groups to leave separately.  Jurors were chosen from another county about 250 miles to the south. They heard eight days of arguments and testimony.  The judge twice urged jurors to continue deliberating when they said they were deadlocked. After the third such message, Luther declared the mistrial and thanked them for serving, adding: “I’ve asked a lot of you.”",US,-0.9977
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/us/timeline-luigi-magione-ceo-shooting/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Timeline: Before and after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s killing,"CNN —  As investigators work to piece together the possible motive and movements of 26-year-old Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione, suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, here’s what we know.  This timeline is based on information from law enforcement sources, official police releases, surveillance images and social media records.  Summer of 2024  Mangione had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  During the summer, Mangione appears to stop posting online, prompting worried messages from some of his friends.  In July, one user posts on X, tagging Mangione, saying, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding.  Mid-November  Mangione’s mother reports her son missing in San Francisco, law enforcement officials said.  Sunday, November 24  10:11 p.m. – Mangione arrives in New York at the Port Authority bus terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue via a bus that originated in Atlanta, then gets into a cab that takes him to the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, where he stays about half an hour.  There was an interaction while the suspect was checking in at the hostel, making casual conversation. ""At some point, he pulled his mask down and smiled at the at the clerk,"" said Joseph Kenny, NYPD chief of detectives. NYPD  11 p.m. – He takes another cab to a hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave. on the Upper West Side, identified as HI New York City Hostel in charging documents.  11:20 p.m. - Surveillance footage from the hostel shows him checking in and showing a driver’s license, according to the arrest warrant in the case. Records from the hostel show he provided a New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario on it, the warrant says.  Friday, November 29  Mangione checks out of the hostel.  “It’s not your traditional check in, check out. It’s the kind of thing where if you don’t show up at a certain time, they automatically just check you out,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. “We don’t believe that he went someplace else. It’s more of an administrative checkout.”  Saturday, November 30  Mangione checks back into the hostel.  Wednesday, December 4  5:34 a.m. – Surveillance footage reviewed by law enforcement shows Mangione leaving the hostel, possibly by bike.  5:41 a.m. – He is seen wandering around the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown, on Sixth Avenue between West 53rd and 54th Streets, and goes back and forth for a bit before heading toward a Starbucks.  “We have him wandering around, walking in the vicinity of hotel, walking on 54th Street, walking back and forth,” Kenny said.  Around 6:17 a.m. – Images from Starbucks show him buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, according to a law enforcement official.  Image of the suspect at a Starbucks on Sixth Avenue. NYPD  6:19 a.m. – Surveillance video near a deli on West 55th Street appears to show him walking and briefly stopping by a pile of trash.  Gideon Platt, Stage Star Deli  6:30 a.m. – Around 6:30 a.m., surveillance video captures what appears to be the gunman on the phone.  Patrick Laborde  6:44 a.m. – Thompson, the victim, walks toward the Hilton after leaving his hotel across the street, police said.  The masked gunman is “lying in wait” outside the hotel as Thompson makes his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.  The gunman comes up behind Thompson and shoots him in the back, Kenny said. He then walks toward Thompson and continues to shoot, stopping to clear a gun jam before firing again.  Obtained by CNN  Investigators told CNN that after the shooting, the assailant crosses the street from the Hilton, flees northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street, and gets on an electric bike on 55th Street before heading north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.  Obtained by CNN  6:48 a.m. – Mangione is seen riding an electric bike into Central Park at 60th Street, according to Kenny.  NYPD  6:56 a.m. – He rides out of the park.  6:58 a.m. - He is seen on the bike at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue.  7:00 a.m. - He is no longer on the bike and is heading northbound on 86th Street.  7:04 a.m. - Mangione gets into a cab.  7:30 a.m. – He is seen near the George Washington Bridge and a Port Authority bus station off 178th Street.  Video shows the suspect entering the bus station.  “We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” Kenny said.  5-Day Manhunt  The suspect was in Pennsylvania for “several days” after the shooting in Manhattan, according to Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police.  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the suspect traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in Altoona, where he is arrested.  Monday, December 9  In a new post on social media, Pennsylvania State Police shared new images of Luigi Mangione sitting inside the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was captured on Monday. The images show Mangione eating what appears to be a hash brown inside the establishment. Pennsylvania State Police  9:14 a.m. - Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania are dispatched to a McDonald’s restaurant, after an employee tipped off police about someone resembling photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police.  9:58 a.m. - Mangione is taken into custody at the McDonald’s, where he presented police with a forged New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario as his identification – the same ID he presented at the hostel, according to the arrest warrant.  Mangione was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea in his first court appearance in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, later that day.  Mangione has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a firearm, according to charging documents released by New York prosecutors.",US,-0.9823

Ryan Borgwardt, 45, was booked into the Green Lake County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system, a service that provides information to crime victims such as a person’s jail custody status. No charges were listed.  The Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday in a social media post that a news conference would be held Wednesday morning to update the Borgwardt case. The post said no further information would be provided until then.  A person answering the phone at the sheriff’s office Tuesday night declined to confirm whether Borgwardt was in custody. County jail officials didn’t immediately return a phone message Tuesday night.  Last month, Sheriff Mark Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on November 11 after disappearing for three months but that he hadn’t committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were “pulling at his heartstrings” to come home. He suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance.  Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of “personal matters,” the sheriff said. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it’s the deepest in Wisconsin.  After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane.  The sheriff said at the time that investigators were working to verify Borgwardt’s description of what happened.  The sheriff’s office has said the search for Borgwardt’s body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn’t expect the search to last more than two weeks.",US,-0.9398

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-abc-news-defamation-lawsuit-settle/index.html,CNN,left,Business,ABC News settles defamation suit with Trump for $15 million,"CNN —  ABC News will pay $15 million to a “presidential foundation and museum” in a settlement reached with President-elect Donald Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.  The settlement, which was filed publicly Saturday, reveals the network will also pay $1 million in Trump’s attorneys’ fees and will issue an apology.  ABC News will issue the following statement as an editor’s note on the online article at the center of the suit: “ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J. Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC’s This Week on March 10, 2024.”  “We are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,” an ABC News spokesperson wrote in a statement.  Trump filed the lawsuit in Florida federal court earlier this year, arguing that Stephanopoulos and ABC News defamed him when the anchor said 10 times during a contentious on-air interview with South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace in March that a jury found Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll.  Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and that he defamed her when he denied her claim. Trump has denied all wrongdoing toward Carroll.  In 2023, a jury found that Trump sexually abused Carroll, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, though it did not find that Carroll proved he raped her. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million for battery and defamation. In January, Carroll was awarded an additional $83.3 million in damages for defamatory statements made by Trump that disparaged her and denied her rape allegations.  A judge concluded in August 2023, when dismissing Trump’s countersuit against Carroll, that the claim Trump raped Carroll was “substantially true.” The judge wrote that Trump “raped” her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.  In the lawsuit filed against ABC News in March, Trump claimed that Stephanopoulos’ statements were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.”  A judge in July refused to dismiss Trump’s lawsuit against the network, writing that these definitions were different enough. He added that the case would turn on “whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury’s verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.”  The settlement came a day after a federal judge ruled that Trump and Stephanopoulos must sit for a deposition sometime next week. The president-elect can now avoid testifying under oath, which could have come with potential legal risks as he prepares to return to the White House.  Trump has a history of filing lawsuits against the news media. In late October, he filed a lawsuit against CBS, demanding $10 billion in damages over the network’s “60 Minutes” interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. His legal counsel claimed the interview with Harris and the associated programming were “partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference” intended to “mislead the public and attempt to tip the scales” of the presidential election in her favor.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-administration-big-donors/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Big donors secure big roles in the incoming Trump administration,"CNN —  Nearly three dozen of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks to serve in his incoming administration donated to his campaign or to the deep-pocketed outside groups that worked to elect him, a CNN analysis of federal campaign records shows.  They range from tech multibillionaire Elon Musk – who has emerged as the single largest, disclosed political donor of the 2024 presidential election – to others close to Trump tapped for key roles throughout government.  In all, eight of his Cabinet picks – led by Linda McMahon, the billionaire wrestling magnate Trump has selected to oversee the Education Department – and their spouses donated more than $37 million combined from their personal accounts to aid Trump, the review found, underscoring the proliferation of ultra-rich Americans now poised to shape US policy in the incoming second Trump administration.  (Two other Cabinet choices, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, transferred money from their campaign accounts to the pro-Trump effort.)  Musk has not been selected for a formal Cabinet job but is helping guide a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative and has played a pivotal role in the presidential transition – offering his views on job candidates, talking to world leaders and meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as he weighs how to downsize the federal government.  In all, the SpaceX and Tesla chief executive donated more than $277 million to federal elections this cycle, the lion’s share of which – more than $262 million – benefited Trump. Most of Musk’s pro-Trump dollars flowed to a super PAC that the world’s richest man created to help turn out voters on the Republican’s behalf in key swing states.  Outside of self-funded presidential candidates, no individual has donated more to shape federal contests in a single election cycle, said Brendan Glavin, research director of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes money in politics.  Trump’s donors “are not just getting these sort of plum ambassadorships on the side,” Glavin said. “Major donors are getting positions that affect policy.”  The CNN analysis researched the more than 90 people that Trump had announced for high-level positions in the administration through Tuesday, which marked five weeks since his election victory. More than 30 of them had donated to his campaign or to one of the leading Trump-aligned outside groups, the review of FEC records found.  “Millions of Americans fed up with failure in the White House and federal government joined President Trump in the movement to restore our nation’s greatness. Some who will work with President Trump are among those millions of people who supported the campaign and helped the President win a decisive electoral victory,” Brian Hughes, a Trump transition team spokesman, said in a statement in response to CNN’s inquiry about donors joining the administration.  The total donations from Trump’s current Cabinet picks marks a surge from Trump’s first term. Five members of his original Cabinet had donated nearly $8 million to his committees or to the major outside groups supporting him, a review of campaign reports shows.  Donations from McMahon, who served as Trump’s SBA administrator in his first White House term, accounted for more than 90% of that total in the 2016 election.  The sums spent to aid Trump in 2024 far exceed the donations that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet members contributed to help him win the White House in 2020, FEC records show.  A dozen members of Biden’s Cabinet reported donations to his campaign or major super PACs involved in the 2020 election, giving less than $100,000 in total.  Billionaires in the administration  Musk’s spending dwarfed that of other supporters.  McMahon was the largest donor among Trump’s Cabinet picks and the second most generous contributor, after Musk, among the administration members announced through Tuesday, the review found.  Most of the $21.2 million she donated went to Make American Great Again, Inc., the main Trump-affiliated super PAC that spent heavily on advertising to aid his campaign.  Other seven-figure donors among Trump’s Cabinet picks include Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick, whom Trump has tapped to serve as Commerce secretary; Scott Bessent, the hedge fund executive Trump has selected to oversee the Treasury Department; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, his choice to head the Small Business Administration.  Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher, also was a major donor, contributing more than $2 million to the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and Trump’s joint fundraising committee.  Sprecher is the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and was at Trump’s side when the president-elect rang the opening bell at the exchange Thursday.  In an email, Loeffler’s communication director Caitlin O’Dea said, “Senator Loeffler is proud to be one of President Trump’s strongest supporters for the same reason a historic landslide of Americans voted to put him back in the White House: he will restore American prosperity, security, and opportunity.”  The billionaire embrace marks a turnaround of sorts for Trump, who saw corporate America recoil from him after the violent January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And he has seen new support from tech leaders who are pushing for fewer regulations from the federal government.  The staggering sums spent by Musk in this year’s election helped Trump close the financial advantage of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who swiftly raised $1 billion after becoming her party’s standard-bearer in late July.  Super PACs face no limit on the size of donations they can receive or spend, but technically are not allowed coordinate their advertising decisions with the candidates they support.  However, a ruling this year by the FEC granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing efforts freed up Musk to guide a ground game for Trump.  “The campaign finance system is a joke,” said Fred Wertheimer, who heads the Democracy 21 watchdog group and is a longtime advocate for limits on money in politics. “Musk is the example now of how campaign finance laws have failed.”  He said he worries about government departments led by billionaires who have no “interest in doing the job that the agency was assigned.”  Musk did not respond to inquiries from CNN.  But Tom Davis, a former congressman from Virginia who chaired the House Republicans’ campaign arm for several years, argues “there is nothing inherently wrong about people who made a lot of money wanting to give back through government.”  “The fact that they have contributed shows a degree of loyalty,” he added.  Friends and family  Presidents often reward donors and allies with plum positions – often dispatching them to glamorous, low-conflict posts in Europe or the Caribbean.  Some of Trump’s early picks for ambassadorships follow that pattern and include billionaires who donated to his reelection effort. Among them: Arkansas investor Warren Stephens, named as the US’ envoy to the UK, and Charles Kushner, Trump’s choice for ambassador to France – one of several extended family members or close friends who has been chosen for diplomatic gigs.  Kushner, who donated $2 million to pro-Trump efforts and received a presidential pardon at the end of Trump’s first term, is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. Another donor, Tom Barrack, who oversaw the fundraising for Trump’s first inauguration, is his choice as ambassador to Turkey.  And incoming special envoy to the Middle East, real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff, is a longtime Trump friend and a partner in the cryptocurrency businesses that Trump launched with his sons earlier this year.  He donated $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC.",US,0.9994
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/antony-blinken-jordan-syria/index.html,CNN,left,Business,"US has had direct contact with Syrian rebel group, Blinken says","Aqaba, Jordan CNN —  The United States has had direct contact with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Syrian rebel group now in de-facto control of the country, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday.  The first public confirmation of direct interaction with the US-designated terrorist group, known as HTS, came at the conclusion of Blinken’s diplomatic sprint through the region spurred by the sudden collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  “Yes, we’ve been in contact with HTS and the other parties,” Blinken said at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan. Blinken did not give details on when the contact was made or at what level. There is no legal barrier to speaking with a designated terrorist group.  “We have pressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,” Blinken said, referencing the American journalist who was detained in Syria more than a decade ago. The US has redoubled its efforts to find him in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse.  The US also shared the principles expected of a new Syrian government, including that the rights of all Syrians should be respected, that the country must not become a base for terrorism, that humanitarian aid must be delivered, and that chemical weapons stockpiles should be secured and safely destroyed.  Those principles, circulated by the US in the days after Assad’s shocking ouster, were further agreed upon in a joint statement by the US and a coalition of other countries at an urgent ministerial meeting in Aqaba on Saturday. Blinken said the agreement “sends a unified message to the new interim authority and parties in Syria.”  Ahead of the Saturday ministerial meeting, Blinken met with key partners in Jordan, Turkey and Iraq to garner consensus around the principles.  “America and our partners have an important stake in helping the Syrian people chart this new path,” the top US diplomat said Saturday. “We know what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders — from mass displacement to terrorism.”  “We can’t underestimate the challenges of this moment and the weeks and months ahead,” he added.  Throughout his trip, Blinken sought to emphasize those stakes. Moving forward, the dynamics on the ground in the region could present significant complications, despite a consensus on the principles.  There was an intense spate of fighting in recent weeks in northern Syria between Turkish-backed forces and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which the US sees as a key partner in the fight to keep ISIS degraded.  A fragile truce between the two sides in Manbij appears to be holding, but the fighting forced the SDF to halt its anti-ISIS operations, according to its top commander.  “This is a moment of vulnerability in which ISIS will seek to regroup, taking the advantage of transition in Syria,” Blinken said Saturday, reemphasizing the importance of the SDF.  In meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Ankara, Blinken warned the US does not want to see any party take actions that would allow ISIS to regroup, including by distracting the SDF from its mission to keep the terrorist group degraded and its fighters imprisoned, a US official said. Blinken also emphasized that nobody should take actions that could jeopardize factions in Syria from potentially coming together in a unified government.  In Baghdad, Blinken asked Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to crack down on the powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and to prevent Iran from transiting weapons through Iraq to Shia militias in Syria, the US official said. Such militias have targeted US personnel and interests in the past.  The response to Israel’s actions in Syria has also emerged as point of division between the US and its Arab partners.  Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has pummeled Syria with strikes and sent Israeli troops to — and beyond — a “buffer zone” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria, in what the United Nations said would be a violation of a 1974 agreement. Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Qatar have condemned Israel’s seizure of the buffer zone, calling it an attempted land grab.  The US, however, has not condemned the move, with Blinken saying that they are talking with the Israeli government.  “The stated purpose of those actions from the Israelis is to try to make sure that equipment that’s been abandoned — military equipment that’s been abandoned by the Syrian army — doesn’t fall into the wrong hands: terrorists, extremists, etc.,” he said Thursday. “But … we’re already talking with Israel; we’re all talking to others about the way ahead.”  A US official said Friday that Blinken intends to make clear to his Arab counterparts that Israel told the US that the incursion is temporary — and that the US expects it to be. That policy could change, however, next month when the Trump administration takes office, this official conceded.  This story has been updated with additional information.",US,-0.9886

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-ban-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,left,Business,TikTok’s ban won’t be delayed. Here’s what you should know,"CNN —  TikTok has plans for another appeal as it faces a ban on January 19.  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected a temporary pause on the ban of TikTok, calling such a block “unwarranted” and paving the way for the Supreme Court to potentially decide the fate of the popular video-sharing app.  In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that required TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, to be sold to a non-Chinese company. The latest ruling follows last week’s decision by the same appeals court to uphold the law, citing national security concerns.  The Biden administration previously urged the appeals court not to issue a temporary block on the law, arguing that doing so might allow the company to wait months to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, effectively halting the law indefinitely.  “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said on December 6.  What will TikTok’s next appeal look like?  The Supreme Court could make a quick decision on the case. Both TikTok and the federal government previously asked the appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the January 19 ban.  But the Supreme Court, which has a six-justice conservative majority, seems likely to rule in favor of upholding the ban, Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN earlier this month.  “I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” Schiller said.  Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN earlier this month that the Supreme Court may decide not to review the case at all, in which case TikTok is out of luck.  Do you need to delete the app?  Not necessarily.  The Department of Justice said Wednesday that, if the ban takes effect, it would “not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok” for the app’s more than 170 million monthly users. But don’t expect any more updates from the app or the ability to download it, if the ban takes place.  Two leaders of the US House of Representatives’ committee on China sent a bipartisan letter to the CEOs of Apple and Google parent company Alphabet that said they should prepare to remove TikTok from their US app stores on January 19.  TikTok will also be unavailable on internet hosting platforms. The Justice Department warned users can expect the app to “eventually” be unworkable.  Can the ban be avoided?  There’s still some hope that TikTok could remain active in the United States, though ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell it.  The ban’s legislation leaves room for Biden to grant a one-time, 90-day extension if he determines a company has made progress toward a sale. He hasn’t suggested any plans to do so.  President-elect Donald Trump, who begins his term a day after the ban, could be on TikTok’s side. He said in July (in a video posted to the app) that he would “never ban TikTok” — although he did try to ban it during his first term.  There are a few options: Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, though experts say that’s unlikely to be successful. He could also direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month.",US,0.9622

TikTok Shop raked in $100 million in single-day sales this Black Friday — that’s triple the number from 2023, according to the company. Over Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend alone, the shop saw a 165% increase in shoppers year-over-year, according to a statement by the company this month.  However, a US appeals court this month upheld a law that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 or face a US ban.  That ban could grind the sales platform’s progress to a halt — but creators who spoke to CNN say that they’re sticking with TikTok Shop anyway because they don’t think a ban will actually happen.  “I don’t think TikTok is going anywhere. I think they’re going to figure it out, and there’s so many people invested in TikTok,” Autade said. “It’s hard to ignore how much it means to its users.”  What makes TikTok Shop tick?  TikTok Shop provides a pipeline from discovery to purchase by letting users shop products featured in live videos, pinned on brand and influencer profiles, or tagged in content shown on their algorithm-driven For You page.  Even before the launch of its shopping feature, TikTok had already established a reputation as a place for users to find items to add to their wishlists. A study conducted in 2022 by marketing consulting firm Material Plus found that 61% of users purchased an item after seeing content about it on TikTok, helped by hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which has over 12 million posts.  Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and TikTok creator, said combining passive entertainment with a shopping function can tempt users to open their wallets.  “You’ve got all these people who are spending so much time just being (on TikTok) consuming and creating content,” she said. “When you mix in commerce with our favorite source of entertainment, then we’re going to spend all our money there.”  TikTok Shop’s reliance on user-generated content allows consumers to hear from voices they trust.  Lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk says TikTok Shop's main draw is its ability to let consumers see their favorite influencers use the products they promote in real time. Courtesy Carrie Berk  Social media strategist Keenya Kelly says that TikTok Shop is another avenue for content creators to make money on TikTok without having to leave the app. Courtesy Keenya Kelly  “If you see your favorite creator promoting a product on a live stream or a video, you’re more likely to buy it in that moment,” said Carrie Berk, a lifestyle content creator. The thinking among viewers, she said, is that “if a makeup influencer is promoting a product on TikTok Shop, if she says it’s good, then it must be good.”  TikTok users like Autade also say that the app’s focus on short-form videos gives it an edge over other social media platforms.  “When I click on a product and I can see hundreds or even thousands of people posting a video about that product authentically, that really helps,” he said. “On a different platform, I might just see some words, some reviews, some stars here and there,” but seeing the product in action is different.  Another component of TikTok Shop’s growth is its popularity with younger users. Some 62% of Gen Z consumers say that TikTok is their platform of choice when they need to look something up, beating out search engines like Google, according to a report by marketing technology company SOCi published this year.  “Gen Z as a whole has really chosen TikTok as their premier destination for content,” said Jen Jones, chief marketing officer of e-commerce platform Commercetools. “TikTok shop just seemed like a natural place for those dollars to be spent.”  What would a TikTok ban mean for other social media retail platforms?  Social media shopping is not a new phenomenon.  Ninety-two percent of retailers plan to invest more in social commerce this holiday season, according to a study by Commercetools published in October. The same study showed that Facebook Marketplace was the social commerce platform of choice for businesses, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok Shop and X.  In particular, Jones sees an opportunity for YouTube to fill in the space TikTok could leave behind if a ban comes into force.  She says that YouTube could potentially meet demand for the style of short-form videos popularized by TikTok through YouTube Shorts while capitalizing on its longer-form content.  In the past year alone, people watched over 30 billion hours of shopping-related content on YouTube, the company previously told CNN in an email. In 2023, it launched YouTube Shopping, allowing content creators to tag products from brands featured in their videos and earn commissions.  Experts say that if the TikTok ban happens, it will serve as a lesson for brands to not put all their eggs into one marketing basket.  The Shop tab of the TikTok app is seen on an iPhone on June 23 in Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images  “It’s just really important for companies to have a very diversified strategy when it comes to social shopping,” said Jones. “We know that social shopping is here to stay. You can’t get locked into just one platform.”  Kelly says the same advice applies to individual content creators who make money off their posts and videos, and recommends cultivating a following through more direct forms of outreach like email lists.  “We use social media to reach a group of people,” she said. “You need to pull those people off social media onto email so that you have control over your business.”  Still, Kelly says she sees no reason for content creators to be concerned over the court ruling that moves TikTok one step closer to a ban.  “I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, she said. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.”  Berk commands an audience of almost 4 million followers on TikTok and describes the social media platform as a big part of her livelihood, but she says she’s not worried by the prospect of a total ban next month.  “There has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical,” she said.  Autade still has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, but he told CNN that TikTok was his primary marketing avenue and the platform that has brought him the most success.  Even as the threat of a ban looms nearer, he says it’s still business as usual and plans to continue with a live event in January similar to the one he hosted on Black Friday.  “I’m still all-in on TikTok. I’m still living my day-to-day life, running my businesses, and everything’s pretty much the same until I hear otherwise,” Autade said.",US,0.9961
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked.",US,0.2114
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/sony-stock-record/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Sony hasn’t been this hot since it made the Walkman,"CNN —  The last time Sony was worth this much on the stock market, Bill Clinton was president and the PlayStation 2 was about to debut on American store shelves.  It’s been a rough past two and a half decades for Sony, the 78-year-old company that invented the Walkman and the PlayStation and had long been an icon of consumer electronics. It largely missed the boat on the mobile phone revolution, and while the PlayStation has been profitable, production costs for other electronics have risen while demand has softened.  But as opportunities arise in streaming, Sony is trying to transition from being a legacy consumer electronics company to an original content and entertainment company.  The strategy is working: In the past three years, Sony’s stock (SONY) has started to break out of a decades-long slump. Sony’s stock price in Japan recently closed at the first record high since March 2000, signifying confidence in the company’s ability to evolve its game offerings and steer itself toward entertainment, Damian Thong, a research equity analyst at Macquarie, told CNN.  “If you went back 30 years ago, it was an electronics company, so best known as a seller of hardware,” Thong said. “But today, the company is primarily generating profits off of entertainment, which is games, music and (TV and movies).”  Less hardware, more content  Sony Group, Japan’s third largest company by market value, has turned itself around by innovating its games business beyond consoles and making acquisitions to expand its IP, Joost van Dreunen, an adjunct assistant professor at NYU Stern who teaches the business of video games, told CNN.  Sony acquired Anime powerhouse Crunchyroll in 2021, and it acquired American video game company Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion.  In addition to Sony Interactive Entertainment, which makes the PlayStation, the behemoth Sony Group also includes Sony Pictures, which produces films like the Spider-Man series, and Sony Music, which includes Columbia Records.  Sony is trying to unlock synergy across its subsidiary companies to produce original entertainment content for consumers, van Dreunen said.  Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal in the first season of ""The Last of Us."" Liane Hentscher/HBO  That strategy of leveraging its intellectual property across its brands became apparent at the 75th Emmy Awards in January, when the TV series “The Last of Us” won eight primetime awards. It was the first time a TV show adapted from a videogame earned major consideration at a Hollywood awards ceremony.  It was a momentous occasion for Sony, which first published “The Last of Us” as a videogame in 2013 before it was adapted to become a TV series released in 2023 on HBO and Max. (HBO and Max share ownership with CNN.)  Without a streaming network of its own, licensing its intellectual property and original content is part of Sony’s strategy to compete with streaming giants like Netflix, Disney and Amazon.  Robert Lawson, the chief communications officer for Sony Group, said in a statement that since 2018 when the company acquired EMI publishing, making Sony Music the world’s largest publisher of music, Sony has invested approximately 1.5 trillion yen into content IP across various entertainment businesses.  “Sony Group has shifted its corporate strategies towards strengthening its creation and entertainment assets,” Lawson said, noting the company is focusing on “new collaborations between Sony sister companies,” including leaning heavily into the anime genre.  In the last fiscal year ending March, Sony’s entertainment business, which includes music, movies and games, accounted for 60% of total revenue. That’s double from a decade ago, when the entertainment business accounted for just 30% of total revenue.  A long road to dominance  Doubling down on entertainment represents a departure from Sony’s origins.  Before there was Sony, there was Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, founded in 1946 by Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka. The company released Japan’s first-ever magnetic tape record in 1950. In 1958, the company changed its name to Sony Corporation.  In the 1960s, Sony established its business in the United States. For the next three decades, the Japanese company emerged as a household name in consumer electronics, producing iconic devices from the Trinitron color TV in 1968 to the Walkman cassette player in 1979 to the world’s first CD player in 1982, in addition to numerous cameras and video recorders.  Sony has also been involved with music since the 1960s through a joint venture with CBS that became Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Yet it’s largely been known for its electronics.

Aflo/Shutterstock  The 1990s were a high point for Sony as it broke into the world of gaming consoles. With the release of the PlayStation in 1994, Sony disrupted the arcade and gaming industry.  Since the 1990s, Sony has been a dominant player in the videogame console business with iterations of the PlayStation. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, which has consistently outsold its main competitors like Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Nintendo’s Switch, according to data from Ampere Analysis, an analytics firm for the games business.  Van Dreunen said that Sony is also looking to evolve in gaming beyond its console business, looking for new audiences and methods of distribution.  “We’re currently going through a softer period in gaming, and so it really raises the stakes for companies like, what’s next?” he said. “How do you as the dominant console maker continue to innovate and continue to grow your business?”  An original PlayStation is pictured at a display of various memorabilia in the lobby of the Sony headquarters building in central Tokyo on November 27, 2024. December 3 this year marked the 30th anniversary of the first release of Japan's Sony PlayStation, transforming the world of video games. Richard A. Brooks/AFP/Getty Images  A customer walks away after purchasing the new Sony Playstation PS5 in Seoul on November 12, 2020, after Sony launched the new console in select markets around the world. Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images  Thong said that Sony has been successful in becoming a profitable channel for third-party publishers to sell videogames.  Sony has tried to diversify its strategy toward gaming, including publishing a videogame called Helldivers 2 across PlayStation5 and also PC. Helldivers 2 was a hit for Sony and sold over 12 million copies within three months of its release, according to Anna Kerr, a research manager for games at Ampere Analytics.  “The games business is spreading out its IP,” NYU Stern’s van Dreunen said. “It’s looking for new ways to reach customers, to expand that customer reach.”  In November, Sony announced a 69% percent jump in net quarterly profit, driven in part by its game segment. The company has had consistently strong quarters this year, driven by profitability in its games.  The company is now in talks to acquire Kadokawa, a Japanese videogame powerhouse that produces the popular videogame “Elden Ring,” according to people familiar with the matter.  There have been some headwinds: Sony’s rollout of the “Concord” vieogame and Sony Pictures’ latest installment of the Spider-Man universe were largely flops among fans this year. However, they are trial and error runs, van Dreunen said, and manageable expenditures for a company that has denoted 1.8 trillion yen ($11 billion) for acquisitions and stock buybacks through March 2027.  In May, at Sony’s annual investor conference, Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida said that the company was embracing a “creative entertainment vision.”  Sony’s emergence as an entertainment company was not always certain, Thong said.  “Sony had some years of quite substantial pain, I would say,” Thong said. “And I think to their credit, they managed to weather and see through it.”  Bringing Sony IP to the big screen  Van Dreunen said in the past, there wasn’t as much demand for videogame adaptations for movie and TV. Yet “The Last of Us” showed that Sony had an opportunity to bring more Sony IP to the big screen.  Before “The Last of Us,” Sony also tried its hand at videogame adaptation with “Uncharted,” a 2022 movie featuring actor Tom Holland that was based on a video game franchise first published by Sony in 2007.

Sony is still in the electronics business, Thong said, noting its image sensors business works with companies like Apple and it produces high-end cameras. However, it has shed its identity as a mass consumer electronics company.  In 2025, Sony intends to spin off its online banking and insurance units, further doubling down on its entertainment offerings.  Sony’s stock is up almost 18% in the past month, outpacing entertainment heavyweights like Disney and Netflix, and boosted from investors piling into the Nasdaq, which crossed 20,000 for the first time this week.",US,0.9996
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/business/unitedhealthcare-insurance-denials-change/index.html,CNN,left,Business,UnitedHealth Group CEO: America’s health system is poorly designed,"CNN —  In his first public response to the consumer outcry following the fatal shooting of one of his top executives, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said Friday that the US health system “is not perfect” and that coverage decisions “are not well understood.”  “We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people’s frustrations with it,” Witty wrote in a guest essay in the New York Times. “No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It’s a patchwork built over decades.”  Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.  “Together with employers, governments and others who pay for care, we need to improve how we explain what insurance covers and how decisions are made,” Witty wrote. “Behind each decision lies a comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety.”  Witty also praised UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was killed in midtown Manhattan last week, writing that Thompson “fought for preventive health and quality health outcomes rather than simply adding ever more tests and procedures.”  In a statement on Friday, UnitedHealthcare said “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company’s treatment of insurance claims” and that it “approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission,” noting that “around one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons.”  Will changes be made?  Thompson’s fatal shooting pushed Americans’ dissatisfaction with their health insurance into the spotlight. Many have made their frustrations abundantly clear on social media.  Journalists have also chronicled insurers’ efforts to twist the system to their benefit. STAT, a news site that focuses on health care, has published a series of investigative stories on UnitedHealth, including articles on how the nation’s largest health insurer uses a computer algorithm to cut off rehabilitation care for Medicare enrollees, limiting clinical case managers’ discretion.  Whether the public outcry prompts UnitedHealthcare and other insurers to adjust their practices — particularly the much-maligned denials of treatment and claims — or pushes lawmakers to force the industry to make changes remains to be seen. It depends, in part, on whether patients continue making their voices heard, experts say.  Angry consumers have had success in overhauling the health insurance industry in the past. They railed against the restrictions of health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, in the 1990s, as captured in the 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” That helped spur insurers to offer more preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, which have fewer constraints but are more costly.  Any shifts in the nation’s complex health care system, however, will not come easily, nor quickly, experts say. There are many players involved, each of which has its own patient care concerns, financial interests and lobbying dollars to influence lawmakers.  UnitedHealthcare’s mission  While many patients and their advocates argue that insurers deny care to pad their profits, the industry maintains that it is protecting consumers from high prices and unnecessary care.  Soon after Thompson’s murder, Witty vowed in an internal message to employees to continue the insurer’s mission of helping “the system improve.”  “Our role is a critical role, and we make sure that care is safe, appropriate, and it’s delivered when people need it,” said Witty in a video message obtained by CNN. “And we guard against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex and ultimately unsustainable. So we’re going to continue to make that case.”  “What we know to be true is that the health system needs a company like UnitedHealth Group,” he continued.  Asked Thursday whether it will make any changes in response to consumers’ public complaints, UnitedHealthcare referred CNN to Witty’s video. Other major insurers either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment, but a leading industry association said that hospitals, providers and employers all have “a direct impact on the cost and accessibility of medical services.”  “In the fragmented and heavily regulated health care system, health plans, providers and drugmakers share a responsibility to make high-quality care as affordable as possible and easier to navigate for the people we collectively serve,” AHIP, the trade group, said in a statement. “Health plans are working to protect patients from the full impact of rising costs while connecting them to care that is safe, evidence-based and coordinated.”  But the recent events may prompt insurers to investigate their practices and make some changes, Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in an email to CNN. This is especially likely if they see risks to their businesses, such as if employers threaten to leave because coverage decisions are too onerous for their workers.  On the flip side, “the main reason to not change their practices is to maintain their profitability while also keeping costs reasonable in a broad sense for their clients and end users,” Utterback wrote.  Video Ad Feedback Scott Galloway says online rage directed at health care CEOs is directed at the wrong people. Hear why. 01:43 - Source: CNN  The HMO backlash  Though former President Bill Clinton failed to reform health care in the early 1990s, his administration’s efforts spurred increased concerns over the cost of care. That cued the growth of the HMO model, which allowed policyholders to see only certain doctors and required referrals from primary care physicians to see specialists and get certain tests and procedures. But HMOs also typically featured low premiums, low or no co-pays and no deductibles.  Policyholders rebelled because they felt they couldn’t access the care they needed, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.  Their angst was captured in extensive media coverage and in the 1997 film “As Good As It Gets,” when a young boy’s mother (played by Helen Hunt) tells a doctor (played by Harold Ramis) that her insurer would not cover an allergy test for her son’s asthma.  “F**king HMO, bastard pieces of sh*t,” Hunt says, before apologizing.  “That’s ok. Actually, I think that’s their technical name,” Ramis replies.  Many states responded to the complaints by passing patients’ bills of rights that limited HMO cost-control practices in state-regulated plans. Employers, who were hearing from angry workers, began shifting to PPOs, which generally provide coverage for a wider range of doctors but have much higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. PPOs have now largely eclipsed the managed care model.  But as health care costs continue to skyrocket, PPOs are instituting practices that resemble those of HMOs, particularly requiring approval of care in advance, known as prior authorization, Levitt said.  “If you think health care costs are rough now, imagine them without constraints,” said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+, a health care consulting group, and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.  Health insurers, however, do at times backtrack when faced with intense blowback. Earlier this month, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield halted its plan to limit the amount of time it would cover anesthesia used in surgeries and procedures after criticism from doctors and politicians. The policy was designed to reduce overbilling and make care more affordable, the insurer had said.  Efforts in Congress  Congress has tried for years to improve access to care and curtail costs, which are far higher in the US than in its peers even though it ranks last on key health measures. Lawmakers have held hearings and introduced bills, but there haven’t been comprehensive reforms enacted since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 — aside from several significant Medicare drug cost provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.  An effort to improve the prior authorization process in Medicare Advantage plans failed to advance in the Senate in 2022 after the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost about $16 billion over a decade.  However, there is now more bipartisan appetite on Capitol Hill to enact reforms, said Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive and vocal critic of the health care industry. Lawmakers reintroduced the prior authorization bill, which now comes with a zero cost estimate, and released a framework to establish so-called site-neutral payments in Medicare, under which Medicare would pay the same rate for a service provided in a hospital outpatient department, an ambulatory surgical center or physician’s office.  Plus, lawmakers are looking at reforms to the pharmacy benefit manager industry, which serves as a middleman between health insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers.  Republicans, who will control Congress starting in January, will be looking for cost savings to offset extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Whitlock said. That could push them to pass measures that would save the government money, such as site-neutral payments.  Meanwhile, the murder of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO will remain in the news as the case against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, winds its way through the court system. That will keep public frustration with health insurers in the spotlight – and could help advance legislation on Capitol Hill, Potter said.  “It will be a years long fight, but it’s going to happen,” he said. “Some kind of reform is inevitable.”",US,0.9982

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/wisconsin-kayaker-ryan-borgwardt-custody/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Wisconsin kayaker turned himself in after officials say he faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe,"CNN —  A Wisconsin man who officials say faked his own death and fled to Eastern Europe was charged with a misdemeanor count of obstructing an officer Wednesday after he turned himself in to authorities.  Ryan Borgwardt, who was reported missing in August, flew back to the United States willingly, arriving Tuesday, said Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll, who remained tight-lipped on why the man left his wife and three children by allegedly staging a kayaking accident, and where exactly he’s been for the past four months.  “He came back on his own,” said Podoll during a news conference Wednesday. When asked by the media why Borgwardt decided to return, Podoll added, “His family, I guess.”  Borgwardt’s wife filed a petition for legal separation on Thursday, Dodge County court documents show. In Wisconsin, a legal separation does not end a marriage, unlike a divorce, but allows the court to rule on the same issues that come up in a divorce proceeding.  In her petition, Borgwardt’s wife is requesting sole legal custody of their three teenage children, claiming the 22-year marriage is “irretrievably broken.”  Borgwardt appeared in court Wednesday and said he could not afford an attorney and offered to represent himself. Circuit Court Judge Mark T. Slate reminded the defendant he has the right to a court-appointed attorney and could request one if needed.  Slate entered a not guilty plea on Borgwardt’s behalf and ordered a $500 signature bond. Borgwardt has since bonded out of jail and is expected back in court on January 13, online court records show.  If convicted of the obstruction charge, Borgwardt faces a maximum penalty of a $10,000 fine and nine months in jail, Judge Slate said.  At the request of the prosecutor, Slate did not order but instead requested the media not share images of Borgwardt’s family members. He denied requests for a gag order in the case and for Borgwardt to surrender his passport.  Ryan Borgwardt's booking photo Green Lake County Sheriff  Podoll declined to share details of Borgwardt’s time away or whether he has been in touch with his family. The investigation involved a number of state and federal agencies including the FBI and Homeland Security, he added.  Borgwardt, 45, was reported missing August 12 after failing to return from a fishing trip on Green Lake, about an hour north of his home in Watertown, Wisconsin.  For seven weeks, the Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office searched for Borgwardt’s body with the help of trained volunteers but found only the man’s kayak and a tackle box containing a set of keys, a wallet and his license. Eventually, officials uncovered evidence that Borgwardt had fled to Europe by way of Canada.  Investigators made contact with the father of three on November 11, when they say they learned he executed a plan to fake his own death for a “number of reasons” unknown to the public.  Authorities communicated with Borgwardt almost daily, Podoll said during a news conference in late November, adding that Borgwardt appeared to be safe but had still not spoken to his family.  How Borgwardt ‘disappeared’  On the day he vanished, Borgwardt traveled to Green Lake – one of Wisconsin’s deepest inland lakes – with a plan to fake his own drowning, according to Podoll, who detailed the man’s scheme.  The experienced kayaker paddled out onto the water where he deliberately overturned the vessel, tossed his phone and returned to shore in a child-sized inflatable boat, Podoll said.  Borgwardt then rode an e-bike through the night about 80 miles to Madison, Wisconsin, where he then boarded a bus to Detroit, eventually crossing the Canadian border and flying to Europe, Podoll said.  Before his disappearance, Borgwardt transferred funds to a foreign bank account, changed his email and communicated with a woman in Uzbekistan, according to Podoll. A criminal complaint filed Wednesday said Borgwardt brought approximately $5,500 in cash with him.  Investigators were ultimately able to contact Borgwardt through a Russian-speaking woman, Podoll said, though he declined to say whether she was the woman he had been communicating with in Uzbekistan and whether he was with her.  Borgwardt told police he heavily researched how to disappear by looking up previous cases, and that “everything hinged on me dying in the lake” and the “whole idea was to sell the death,” the complaint said.  In January, Borgwardt took out a $375,000 life insurance policy, which Podoll said was intended to help his family.  “In our communications, we are expressing the importance of his decision to return home and clean up the mess that he has created,” Podoll said. Borgwardt has expressed regret for how he has hurt his family and “also feels bad about the amount of hours that we have put in the community,” the sheriff said.  The long, expansive search for Borgwardt was a costly and emotionally taxing endeavor for both his family and search crews, Podoll said.  Borgwardt’s family has experienced emotional whiplash after mourning him for weeks and then coming to terms with his purported abandonment, the sheriff said on “CNN News Central” last month.  Borgwardt previously told investigators he thought they would stop searching for him after about two weeks, officials said.  “He picked the wrong sheriff and the wrong department,” Podoll said.  The search for Borgwardt  On the morning of August 12, Borgwardt’s capsized kayak was found in the lake and his vehicle and trailer were found at a nearby park, Podoll said.  The following day, two fishermen casting along the lake found a fishing rod that belonged to Borgwardt, his wife told officials. A tackle box was found later that day with several of Borgwardt’s belongings: a set of keys, a wallet and his license.  In October, investigators learned from Canadian officials Borgwardt had entered the country on August 13.  Borgwardt’s passport was found at the family home, but learning he left the country gave investigators a break in the case and prompted them to search his computer and dig deeper, according to Podoll.  Investigators found Borgwardt had replaced the hard drive on his laptop and cleared his browser history on the day of his disappearance, Podoll said. He had also reported his passport stolen and obtained a replacement last spring.  Though the county will seek restitution for the taxpayer-funded search efforts, that does not include the thousands of dollars spent by the non-profit Bruce’s Legacy, which helped in the underwater search for Borgwardt’s body. Borgwardt told police he didn’t realize organizations like that existed, the complaint says.  Keith Cormican, director of Bruce’s Legacy, told CNN he spent nearly 30 days working on the case. The first two weeks of the search alone will cost him about $10,000 due to damaged equipment and other expenses, he said.  “My success rate is pretty good,” Cormican told CNN. “To not be able to find him … really had me questioning my abilities. And I lost a lot of sleep over it.”  CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe and Bill Kirkos contributed to this report.",US,-0.9964
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process with the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items which may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  FBI: San Francisco police recognized suspect  On Friday, the FBI told CNN they received a tip from the San Francisco Police Department, saying an officer with the department’s Special Victims Unit had recognized Mangione as a possible suspect on December 5 after seeing the surveillance photos of the suspect’s unmasked face.  The San Francisco Chronicle first reported on the tip Thursday.  Chronicle reporter Megan Cassidy told CNN’s John Berman her team reported “a few days ago” on the existence of a missing persons report in San Francisco for Mangione.  “Apparently, there was somebody at SFPD that was looking into the missing persons case, and after the shooting of Brian Thompson, recognized this person and called in this tip, or emailed this tip, to the FBI,” Cassidy said.  The FBI then sent the tip to New York investigators during the manhunt, the agency told CNN.  CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explained on Friday’s “AC360” how the tip ultimately made its way to the FBI in New York and the NYPD.  “This tip comes from, I think, a victim witness specialist in the San Francisco Police Department who had that missing persons case somewhere in front of them and looked at that face and says, ‘Gee, that could be the guy that is on these FBI posters all over town,’ so SFPD sends that to San Francisco FBI,” Miller said.  “San Francisco FBI says, ‘that’s a New York office case,’” he added.  Miller explained the FBI’s New York office likely sent the information to a violent crimes squad composed of a mix of FBI agents and NYPD officers.  “They look at it and they do a workup on the name, checking, you know, any indicators that guy’s been in New York, and then they send it over to NYPD,” Miller said.  By Sunday, the tip joined 200 viable leads being examined by authorities, according to Miller.  “Then Monday morning, at 9:15 in the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, another tip leads to the capture,” he said. “So you see, these leads are piling up, being tasked out and being worked, and this was in that pile coming up because it was a viable lead. It’s just that destiny took a hand quicker.”  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.",US,-0.9995

CNN —  I’m not much of a hugger. Sure, I’ll bust out the warm fuzzies for relatives around the holidays but I’m not like, say, my best friend, who prefers her hugs to produce the bone-liquifying pressure of an industrial vise. My husband loves to tell the story of our first date, when he approached me with open arms and I maneuvered him into a firm, businesslike handshake. Touch is just not my love language! And if you’re also not a hugger, the holidays are a gauntlet of outstretched arms and sweatered bosoms and unfamiliar colognes. We’ll make it through together! I recently watched some interviews with the lead actresses of the new “Wicked” film (which is sooo so good), and each tends to clutch the other’s single beautifully taloned finger when things get deep. I do that too! It is emotionally supportive without being suffocating (literally or figuratively). Fingertip-to-fingertip touching is the new hugging, pass it on.  Here’s all the good things that happened this week.  Nana Kyei  1. The Friendship Queen Diaries  It’s like something out of a movie: Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in 1996. Now, she’s a queen in Ghana. Despite her challenging youth, Johnson made sure she and her daughter were well-traveled, and after discovering she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, she founded a travel company to organize trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Her work attracted the attention of the Dakpema, a governing body in northern Ghana. She was blown away when they asked her to accept the title of “Zosimli Naa,” or “Friendship Queen.” The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the centuries-old Dagbon Kingdom, which comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in the city of Tamale, where she now lives. “We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.  CNN  2. Fabric of rebirth  The iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is finally open to the public again after a devastating fire damaged it five years ago. As part of this rebirth, fashion designer and artist Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was asked to create new vestments, or special service garments, for the cathedral’s clergy. Vestments are an important part of a church’s identity and de Castelbajac said the theme for the new look was “noble simplicity.” The designer drew inspiration from Notre Dame’s stained glass and blonde stone, creating a look that he said speaks to tradition and innovation; old and new. The vision was “radiant with color, radiant of hope, radiant of faith,” de Castelbajac told CNN. You can see details of the vestments in the photo above, and learn more about de Castelbajac’s process in this video.  CNN  3. Music on the brain  If you’ve ever shared your life with someone with dementia or another progressive neurological disease, you know music can be magic. Toronto-based company LUCID is combining facial mapping software, artificial intelligence, and music to create a therapy for older patients dealing with health challenges like Alzheimer’s, dementia and even depression and anxiety. The treatment involves measuring how a person’s brain reacts to music and combining that with facial mapping and artificial intelligence. Using this data, the technology can create specific playlists that hopefully can alleviate stress, restlessness, confusion and emotional discomfort in dementia patients.  Natalia Botero-Acosta  4. I would swim 500 miles  This whale puts The Proclaimers to shame! A male humpback whale has completed an extraordinary record-breaking migration, swimming more than 8,000 miles from South America to Africa. The humpback was first spotted off the coast of Colombia in 2013 and seen again a few years later not far from its original location. But in 2022, the whale was unexpectedly detected in the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa. The typical migration route for humpback whales can approach 5,000 miles in a single direction, making this one’s journey close to two times that of most whales. The discovery also marks the first documentation of an adult male humpback traveling between the Pacific and Indian oceans.  Video Ad Feedback This Saudi dish transports you to the desert 02:31 - Source: CNN  5. The power of good food  Hadeel Al Motawa knows that food can be so much more than simple sustenance. She co-founded the award-winning restaurant Takya, located in the 600-year-old historic center of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. Though the food has all the artfully prepared aura of a high-class restaurant, the menu is inspired by the traditional home cooking Al Motawa grew up with, and by her travels around Saudi Arabia and abroad. After seeing the deep connection between food and culture, Al Motawa wanted to “bring that same connection back home, to create a space where people could rediscover the beauty of Saudi cuisine.” Saudi Arabia itself is a country of great geographical, and thus culinary, diversity. For example, the Eastern Province is known for its seafood, such as Muhammar, a fried fish dish made with rice and sugar that was traditionally popular among sailors. In the country’s northern region, where temperatures are cooler and may drop below freezing during winter, traditional recipes focus on grains and meat, like the popular jareesh, a lamb stew made with wheat and yogurt.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Downtown San Francisco experiences first tornado warning in recorded history,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said. Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and about 300 miles northwest of Sacramento.",US,-0.989
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/crystal-mangum-duke-lacrosse-allegations/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Duke lacrosse scandal: Crystal Mangum admits to false rape allegations,"CNN —  More than 18 years after accusing three former Duke University lacrosse players of raping her, a falsified account she shared in graphic detail, Crystal Mangum has admitted she lied about the encounter.  In an interview on a web show published Wednesday, Mangum apologized to the men and said her relationship with God has made her understand why she fabricated the story. Mangum is serving time in prison on a second-degree murder conviction for killing her boyfriend.  The timeline of the North Carolina case begins in 2006, when Mangum said she was trapped inside a bathroom, sexually assaulted and raped by David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann at a team party where she was performing as an exotic dancer. The men were arrested following her allegations.  “I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn’t, and that was wrong. And I betrayed the trust of a lot of other people who believed in me,” Mangum said on Katerena DePasquale’s show, “Let’s Talk with Kat.” “I made up a story that wasn’t true because I wanted validation from people and not from God.”  David Evans, left, Collin Finnerty, center, and Reade Seligmann, right, look on during a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2007. Chuck Burton/AP/File  For more than a year, the school and the lacrosse players were thrust into a media frenzy, subjected to intense public scrutiny and damaging allegations of sexual assault that were ultimately dropped.  After Mangum’s confession, Duke told CNN on Friday it would not comment. The former players did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.  Here’s how the events unfolded.  A timeline of the events  • March 13, 2006: Mangum is hired as a dancer for a private party held by members of the Duke men’s lacrosse team. It takes place at a house on North Buchanan Boulevard in Durham. Mangum later accuses several players of raping her during the party early on March 14.  • March 28, 2006: Duke President Richard Brodhead suspends team play for the men’s lacrosse team, a move widely criticized as premature since no formal charges had been made yet. Media attention intensifies, with early reports painting a picture of privileged, White lacrosse players being accused by a Black woman. The case becomes a flashpoint for issues of race, class and privilege, according to the Washington Post.  • March 28-30, 2006: DNA tests on Mangum’s body fail to link any of the lacrosse players to the scene, according to a disciplinary order against prosecutor Mike Nifong by the North Carolina State Bar, but Nifong insists on moving forward with the case. Skepticism about the case begins to mount.  • April 18, 2006: Nifong formally charges Seligmann and Finnerty with rape, according to the disciplinary order. The charges are based largely on Mangum’s testimony, as forensic evidence was either inconclusive or absent.  • May 15, 2006: Nifong formally charges Evans with rape, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 5, 2006: Duke announces the lacrosse team is reinstated to play in the following fall, but public sentiment has already soured.  • December 28, 2006: Nifong is accused of withholding evidence and making misleading statements to the press, leading to an investigation by the state bar, according to the disciplinary order.  • April 11, 2007: Roy Cooper – then the state’s Attorney General and now its governor – announces “there is insufficient evidence to proceed on any of the charges” in a statement shared by Duke Athletics. The charges are dropped.  “We believe that these cases were the result of a tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations,” Cooper said. “Based on the significant inconsistencies between the evidence and the various accounts given by the accusing witness, we believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges.”  • June 16, 2007: Nifong loses his law license following disciplinary hearings about his handling of the case, including accusations of ethical misconduct and withholding evidence. His disbarment is finalized by the state bar in July, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 18, 2007: Duke announces that it has settled with the three lacrosse players, agreeing to pay a confidential settlement.  “It is impossible to fully describe what we, our families and team endured. As we said from day one, we are innocent,” Evans, Finnerty and Seligmann said in a statement. “But it took three hundred and ninety-four days, and the intervention of the North Carolina Attorney General, before our innocence was formally declared.”  • October 5, 2007: The three players file a civil lawsuit against the city of Durham, Nifong and other individuals, according to court documents. Durham later settles the lawsuit in part with a one-time grant of $50,000 to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.  • April 3, 2011: Mangum is charged with stabbing her boyfriend, leading to a lengthy criminal trial, and is convicted of second-degree murder in 2013.  ‘I hope they can forgive me’  Mangum has spent 11 years in prison, which she is getting through by reading the Bible and finding humor in her thoughts, she said in her interview with “Let’s Talk with Kat.”  She wishes she could help children who were sexually abused, she told DePasquale. When asked if she could describe her experience in prison in one word, she says: “Growth.”  Before becoming an exotic dancer, she studied psychology at North Carolina Central University. The transition came from her searching for “validation,” she said in the interview.  “I was looking for love and acceptance from people,” she said. “People to love me, to accept me, to pay attention to me for validation. But you can get all of that in Jesus. He loves us just the way we are. That’s what I learned in prison.  “I hurt my brothers and I hope they can forgive me and I want them to know that I love them and they didn’t deserve that and I hope they can forgive me. I hope they can heal.”  The danger of false rape allegations for actual victims  An advocate for victims of sexual assault said rare cases like this might discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and cause people to wrongly doubt them.  “False reports hurt not only the people falsely accused, they hurt every rape victim,” Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, vice president of communications for RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, told CNN. “There are already too many victims who do not report the crime for fear of not being believed. After a false report in such a high-profile case, even more survivors may be reluctant to come forward out of fear that law enforcement will not believe them.”  A study published by Violence Against Women in 2010 found that false sexual assault reports range from between 2 to 10 percent. A majority of sexual assaults, an estimated 63 percent, are never reported to the police, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.  Kaleba said she encourages people to consider the nearly half million victims in the US of rape and sexual assault each year who may now face renewed disbelief and question the value of reporting sexual violence.  “Don’t allow infrequent, false reporting to stand in the way of standing with survivors,” Kaleba said.",US,-0.9993
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor.",US,-0.9676
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/kirstin-lobato-las-vegas-verdict/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Las Vegas jury awards $34 million to woman falsely accused of murder,"Las Vegas AP —  A federal jury in Nevada has awarded more than $34 million to a woman who was arrested at age 18, wrongly convicted twice, and served nearly 16 years in a Nevada state prison for a 2001 killing she did not commit.  Kirstin Lobato, who is now 41 and uses the name Blaise, cried and hugged her attorneys after a judge read the trial verdict Thursday in US District Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  “It’s been an uphill battle with many, many obstacles,” she told reporters. “And I’m happy that it’s all finally finished.”  Lobato said she didn’t know if becoming a millionaire would make up for years in prison, adding that she had “no idea what the rest of my life is going to look like.”  The civil trial jury found Las Vegas police and two detectives, now retired, fabricated evidence during their investigation and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Lobato. The panel determined that Lobato should receive $34 million in compensatory damages from the department and $10,000 in punitive damages from each former detective.  The detectives, Thomas Thowsen and James LaRochelle, and their attorney, Craig Anderson, declined to comment outside court. Anderson told US District Judge Richard Boulware he planned to file additional court documents following the verdict. Anderson said Friday an appeal was “likely.”  The department previously agreed to pay damages if the jury ruled in Lobato’s favor.  Lobato was 18 when she was interviewed by police without an attorney, arrested and charged with killing Duran Bailey in Las Vegas in July 2001. Bailey, who had been homeless, was found dead near a trash bin with a slashed neck, cracked skull and missing genitals.  No physical evidence or witnesses connected Lobato to the killing, and she maintained she never met Bailey. But police maintained she confessed in jail that she had killed a man who tried to rape her during a three-day methamphetamine binge.  Lobato was 19 when she was convicted of murder in 2002. The Nevada Supreme Court threw out that verdict and Lobato’s prison sentence in 2004 because her lawyers weren’t able to cross-examine a prosecution witness who testified that Lobato made the jailhouse confession.  Lobato was tried again in 2006, convicted of manslaughter, mutilation and weapon charges, and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.  She was exonerated and freed from prison in late 2017 after the Innocence Project and attorneys in Las Vegas again took her case to the state Supreme Court. Justices said evidence showed that Lobato was in her hometown of Panaca, Nevada, some 150 miles from Las Vegas when Bailey was killed.  Last October, a state court judge in Las Vegas issued a certificate declaring Lobato innocent of Bailey’s killing.  That action was challenged by Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson in a letter asking state Attorney General Aaron Ford to investigate how and why attorneys for Lobato acquired the certificate of innocence.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/baby-garnet-cold-case-michigan/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Baby Garnet cold case update: A DNA test helped solve a 1997 Michigan murder,"CNN —  It was the middle of Jenna Gerwatowski’s workday at the local flower shop in Newberry, Michigan, when she got a call from an unknown number.  The now 23-year-old doesn’t usually answer unknown calls, but says she decided to pick this one up in May 2022.  To her surprise, it was a detective from the Michigan state police.  “He was like, ‘Have you heard of the Baby Garnet case?’” Jenna told CNN.  Jenna had heard of it. In 1997, a deceased infant was found in a campground pit toilet at the Garnet Lake Campground – right where Jenna grew up. Investigators couldn’t find any leads on the identity of the baby or anyone who witnessed a person abandoning an infant, according to a news release from the Michigan attorney general’s office. The case went cold, and the “Baby Garnet” case became a known murder mystery in Jenna’s small town for decades.  “Your DNA was a match,” Jenna says the detective on the phone told her. She was related to the dead infant from 1997.  Jenna was in shock. The detective sounded sure, Jenna said, but she wondered how he had even obtained her DNA.  About six months earlier, her friend had gotten a FamilyTreeDNA test for Christmas and Jenna decided to order her own. DNA from other Baby Garnet relatives led detectives to Jenna’s FamilyTreeDNA kit, according to court documents.  Jenna Gerwatowski, left, says the case was always a big mystery in her town. She had no idea the grandmother she'd never met, Nancy Gerwatowski, right, could be behind it. Jenna Rose Gerwatowski/Mackinac County Sheriff's Office  The detective said a woman from Identifinders International, a genetic genealogy investigation firm, would call her about her DNA to help with identifying closer relatives, according to Jenna.  According to court documents, detectives reopened the cold case in 2017 and then worked with a forensics company to extract DNA from Baby Garnet’s partial femur, before sending the results to Identifinders International.  Jenna explained the situation to her mother when she got home from work.  “It was just crazy,” Jenna said. “We were both sitting there like, I don’t even know who (the mother or father) could’ve been. We were both so confused and we’re like, it’s got to be somebody that we don’t know, you know, like a distant cousin or something.”  Jenna said her mother, Kara Gerwatowski, started to wonder whether the detective call was a scam.  Jenna’s grandfather had just been scammed by someone claiming to be a detective, so Kara told Jenna to be cautious about giving out personal information or passwords.  Misty Gillis, then a senior forensic genealogist and cold case liaison from Identifinders International, called Jenna that night, according to Jenna and court documents filed later in the case.  Jenna claims Gillis requested her FamilyTreeDNA password to be able to upload her DNA into a separate database. Jenna was concerned it was a scammer and refused to cooperate, according to court documents.  “I hung up the phone on her, not even thinking twice about it. And we went about our day. I was like, how weird. What a weird thing to scam people about,” Jenna said. “I wholeheartedly did not think that it was real.”  One week later, Jenna was working at the flower shop when she got a distressed call from her mother.  “She was like, ‘I really need you to come home. … It’s an emergency. Like, just please come as soon as you can,’” Jenna said.  Jenna rushed home thinking someone died. Her cousin was sitting with her mom at their round wooden kitchen table. Police had contacted her cousin, who works as a victim’s advocate in the county prosecutor’s office, to explain the Baby Garnet situation to Jenna. It turned out it wasn’t a scam.  “My mom had tears in her eyes,” she said. Jenna’s cousin had “just pure shock on her face. … You could hear a pin drop in there.”  Even though Jenna knew she had nothing to do with the Baby Garnet case, she was terrified police would think she was trying to hide something because of her refusal to speak with Gillis. She immediately called her.  An analysis of Jenna’s DNA kit showed she was the half-niece to Baby Garnet, according to court records.  On June 1, 2022, detectives spoke with her mother, Kara, who agreed to provide her DNA. Kara was the half-sister of Baby Garnet, according to court records.  “I feel like that is when, like, all of the puzzle pieces kind of started falling together for her,” Jenna said. “And she told detectives that, if it’s going to be anybody, it would be (her) mother.”  Kara, now 42, had not spoken with her mother, Nancy Gerwatowski, since she was 18 because they had a bad relationship, and Jenna had never met her grandmother. Regardless, both were shocked Nancy, who was living in Wyoming when police questioned her, would be the one behind their town mystery.  “I had grown up knowing about the case my whole life and then come to find out it was my grandma that did it?” Jenna said.  The Michigan attorney general’s office alleges Nancy “delivered the newborn alone at her Newberry home, during which Baby Garnet died due to asphyxiation, and that this death could have been prevented by medical intervention (Nancy) Gerwatowski did not seek.”  However, in a court filing, Nancy’s defense argues she unexpectedly gave birth while in the bathtub and the fetus “became trapped inside her birth canal.” She “attempted to pull the fetus out of her own body,” the filing says, but couldn’t deliver the fetus and lost consciousness “at some point in the delivery.” When she was finally able to deliver the fetus, it was dead, the filing says.  Her defense argues that Nancy, like the average person in the county in 1997, did not have access to a telephone or cell line, so she couldn’t call 911. While she concedes in her legal filings she placed the stillborn fetus in a bag and left the remains at the campground, her defense attorneys argue she had been in shock after having had no pain medication during the traumatic birth.  Nancy is charged with one count each of open murder, involuntary manslaughter, and concealing the death of an individual. Open murder carries a potential life sentence.  In a hearing on Thursday, Nancy’s defense argued that the case against her should be dropped in its entirety because the state cannot prove the baby was born alive. If the court allows the case to proceed, the defense argued, Nancy’s statements during police interrogation should be excluded because she was denied her right to counsel — a contention the state disputed. If the court does allow her statements to be a part of the trial, Nancy’s lawyers want her comments about considering an abortion and not seeking out prenatal care to be excluded, while the state argued the comments are relevant to possible motive.  Judge Brian D. Rahilly said he hopes to reach a decision on whether or not to drop the charges by next week or around the end of the year at the latest.  “It was a very hard time … very traumatizing and very nerve-wracking,” said Jenna. “I’ve never met this woman, so it was hard for me to even grasp that concept, but even harder for my mom because that was her mother.”",US,-0.9991
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-thursday-hnk/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,UnitedHealthCare CEO shooting: Suspect Luigi Mangione now faces mounting evidence,"CNN —  Marked shell casings from the assassination scene match the gun found on the suspect. His fingerprints match some key items investigators found nearby. And he was arrested this week – after going silent from his mom and friends for months – with a fake ID and a handwritten “claim of responsibility” referencing the crime site.  These details and others, shared by law enforcement and people who know suspect Luigi Mangione, have been mounting since last week’s daylight killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a busy sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of the investigation into Thompson’s killing, sources tell CNN.  A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN at least two of the warrants include the backpack found in Central Park and the burner phone found along the getaway route police believe Mangione took from the shooting scene. Investigators also searched the hostel where suspected killer Mangione stayed the night before the shooting and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  After a five-day, multi-state manhunt that leaned heavily on surveillance images and pleas for the public’s help, Mangione, 26, is now charged in the case with murder after a tip led to his arrest Monday at a McDonald’s nearly 200 miles from where the brazen homicide unfolded.  Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury in the case against Mangione, sources told ABC News.  Mangione was charged in a felony arrest warrant earlier this week. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  Blair County Judge David Consiglio scheduled a hearing in Pennsylvania on December 30 in response to Mangione’s petitions for writ of habeas corpus and imposition of bail, court documents from Thursday show.  Mangione was denied bail on Tuesday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania. The habeas corpus petition is a key factor in whether the suspect can be extradited to New York.  Mangione’s team was given two weeks from Tuesday to file the habeas corpus petition, which challenges Pennsylvania’s ability to prove that Mangione is the person the state of New York has issued the arrest warrant for, according to Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.  Mangione is also set to appear in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, court on December 23 for a preliminary hearing related to state charges.  Mangione’s lawyer has denied his client’s involvement in the December 4 killing and anticipates he will plead not guilty to the murder and other charges in New York, as well as to charges related to the 3D-printed gun and fake ID in Pennsylvania, where he was caught and is being held without bond.  Defense attorney Thomas Dickey on Wednesday also dismissed the ballistics and fingerprint evidence revealed publicly hours earlier, saying he wants to examine it himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”  Thomas Dickey, attorney for suspected shooter Luigi Mangione, speaks Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “As lawyers, we need to see it. We need to see: How did they collect it? How much of it? And then we would have our experts … take a look at that, and then we would challenge its admissibility and challenge the accuracy of those results.”  Still, New York’s governor expects a murder indictment “to be issued any day now, and the second that happens, I’m issuing a warrant for extradition.”  “It feels like the evidence is very compelling,” Gov. Kathy Hochul told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. “I trust the DA here in Manhattan to make sure that he puts forth an indictment that is going to be iron-clad.”  Meanwhile, Hochul is unimpressed by the folk hero status Mangione has attained on social media as the killing of Thompson – a husband and father of two – has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry.  Mangione appears to have been driven by anger against the industry and “corporate greed” as a whole, states a New York Police Department intelligence report that also warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  “That horrific attack occurred on our streets,” Hochul said Thursday. “And the people of our city deserve to have that sense of calm that this perpetrator has been caught, and he will be never seeing the late of day again if there is justice.”  “You cannot assassinate an individual on the streets of New York – not now, not ever.”  Neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said on Thursday.  Suspect hadn’t spoken to mother since July  Until he was found Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Mangione had gone quiet from at least a few people who appear to have been close with him. The scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, he had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  Mangione’s mother had reported him missing November 18 – two weeks before Thompson’s killing – a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. She called police in San Francisco, where she knew her son had been living, and told authorities she’d called his phone repeatedly to find the voicemail full and not taking any more messages.  Mangione’s mom had no reason to believe her son was a danger to himself or others, she told the San Francisco Police Department, but she hadn’t actually spoken with him since July 1, the official said. He had worked remotely at TrueCar, she also said, where the phone was disconnected and the offices closed, the official added.  It also doesn’t appear Mangione had posted anything since midsummer to social media, where posts addressed to his X account suggest some of his friends have been trying to get in touch with him.  In July, a user tweeted at Mangione, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding. In late November, just weeks before the shooting, another user posted at Mangione, “thinking of you and prayers everyday in your name. Know you are missed and loved.”  As Mangione entered a Pennsylvania courthouse this week, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, he yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Suspected shooter Luigi Mangione is led from the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “He’s irritated, agitated about what’s happening to him and what he’s being accused of,” Dickey told CNN of Mangione’s outburst and struggle with police.  “He never had any legal representation until he walked into that building yesterday. And I talked to him … look at the difference between when he went in and when he came out … now he has a spokesperson and someone that’s going to fight for him.”  Suspect linked to fingerprints and gun  Police in New York on Wednesday publicly revealed the first positive forensic match and direct physical evidence tying Mangione to Thompson’s killing, law enforcement officials told CNN.  “We got the gun in question back from Pennsylvania. It’s now at the NYPD crime lab,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “We were able to match that gun to the three shell casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of the homicide.”  A 3D-printed gun was in Mangione’s possession when he was arrested Monday, police have said.  The three 9 mm shell casings had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, one word per bullet, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Police have been looking into whether those words, which match the title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry, may point to a motive in the killing.  Authorities also had been probing DNA material and a partial fingerprint from a discarded Starbucks water bottle and an energy bar wrapper surveillance images showed the suspect buying about 30 minutes before the shooting. Mangione’s fingerprints were confirmed as a match, Tisch said  Along with the prints and ballistics, investigators have been examining writings police have said Mangione had upon arrest, including a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility.” It did not include specific threats but indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday.  In some writings, he referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny added. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  Investigators also are looking at the suspect’s writing in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.  It included to-do lists to facilitate a killing, as well as notes justifying those plans, the source said. In one notebook passage, Mangione wrote about the late Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber who justified a deadly bombing campaign as an effort to protect against the onslaught of technology and exploitation. Mangione had written about the Unabomber in online posts as well.  In a notebook passage, Mangione concludes using a bomb against his intended victim “could kill innocents” and shooting would be more targeted, musing what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.

The statement did not indicate where Kobayashi was or how the family determined she was safe.  The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement they are “happy to learn that Hannah has been found safe” and due to the new information “this has become a private matter and we will wrap up our investigation.”  The family had launched a GoFundMe that raised over $47,000 to help find Hannah. Donations have been turned off, and donors who would like a refund can submit a claim, the family said.  Hannah Kobayashi arrived at Los Angeles International Airport from Maui on November 8, but did not board her connecting flight to New York, her sister previously told CNN. The family last heard from the 30-year-old on November 11 after spending four days in Los Angeles at various locations, according to video footage and photos.

She was declared a missing person on November 15.  More than three weeks after she left Maui, Los Angeles police declared her as a voluntary missing person on December 2. Video surveillance from US Customs and Border Protection “clearly shows” Hannah Kobayashi crossing the US-Mexico border just after noon on November 12 at the San Ysidro port of entry, police said.  “To date the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a news conference. “She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her.”  Volunteers put up flyers of missing Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi outside Crypto.com Arena in Downtown Los Angeles. Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images/File  Before leaving Maui, investigators found Hannah Kobayashi had expressed a desire to disconnect from modern technology, police said.  Tragedy struck the family during their search for Hannah Kobayashi when her father Ryan Kobayashi, who had traveled from Hawaii to Los Angeles to help look for her, was found dead November 24 near the airport, having taken his own life, the family and authorities say.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/louisville-police-reform-breonna-taylor/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,"DOJ, Louisville reach deal after probe prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor","Louisville, Kentucky AP —  The US Justice Department and the city of Louisville have reached an agreement to reform the city’s police force after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, officials said Thursday.  The consent decree, which must be approved by a judge, follows a federal investigation that found Louisville police have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the “historic content decree” will build upon and accelerate, this transformational police reform we have already begun in Louisville.” He noted that “significant improvements” have already been implemented since Taylor’s death in March 2020. That includes a city law banning the use of “no-knock” warrants.  The Justice Department report released in March 2023 said the Louisville police department “discriminates against Black people in its enforcement activities,” uses excessive force and conducts searches based on invalid warrants. It also said the department violates the rights of people engaged in protests.  “This conduct harmed community members and undermined public trust in law enforcement that is essential for public safety,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This consent decree marks a new day for Louisville.”  Once the consent decree is agreed upon, a federal officer will monitor the progress made by the city.  The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened 12 civil rights investigations into law enforcement agencies, but this is the first that has reached a consent decree. The Justice Department and the city of Springfield, Massachusetts announced an agreement in 2022 but the investigation into that police department was opened under President Donald Trump’s first administration.  City officials in Memphis have taken a different approach, pushing against the need for a Justice Department consent decree to enact reforms in light of a federal investigation launched after Tyre Nichols’ killing that found Memphis officers routinely use unwarranted force and disproportionately target Black people. Memphis officials have not ruled eventually agreeing to a consent decree, but have said the city can make changes more effectively without committing to a binding pact.  It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department’s priorities around civil rights.",US,0.9902
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,New Jersey drones: Lawmakers meet with security officials after weeks of unexplained sightings,"CNN —  Weeks of mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey are prompting heightened security concerns – and mounting frustrations – from residents, military personnel and federal, state and local officials.  While the state’s governor says there’s no threat to public safety, other state officials and local mayors are alarmed.  “I’m legitimately concerned for what the hell is going on because nobody knows,” state Assemblyman Brian Bergen told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey after a briefing at state police headquarters on Wednesday.  “We are literally being invaded by drones. We have no idea who is doing it and where they’re coming from,” Pequannock Mayor Ryan Herb told the station after the briefing.  Law enforcement has not identified the origin or landing sites of the drones, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday. He added that the drones primarily operate at night, often displaying flashing lights, but they turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached.  According to Melham, the drones have eluded radar detection, possibly because they do not emit frequencies or possess evasion capabilities.  He also raised alarm over where some of the drones have been spotted.  “One of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey’s critical infrastructure,” Melham said.  The mayor of West Milford, Michele Dale, reported 60 drones hovering over local reservoirs.  Some members of Congress have speculated that a foreign entity may be involved in the drones, something the Pentagon rebuffed Wednesday.  The denial came hours after US Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, told Fox News the drones were from “a mothership” from Iran that is “off the East Coast of the United States of America.”  “There is not any truth to that,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.”  Meanwhile, US Northern Command, which oversees the Defense Department’s homeland security efforts, said in statement Wednesday that it had “conducted a deliberate analysis of the events” regarding the drone sightings but had not been asked “to assist with these events.”  A spokesperson for the US Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged an encounter by one of its assets with the drones.  “Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  The aircraft were not seen as an immediate threat and did not interfere with operations, Pinneo added.  CNN reached out to the Coast Guard but did not receive an immediate response.  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told WBGO on Wednesday the public should feel secure while acknowledging their fears.  “Based on everything we know, there is no public safety risks we’re aware of,” Murphy said.  “Is it frustrating to have no answers? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes,” the governor told the radio station.  The sightings began November 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. At times, large drones — some up to 6 feet in diameter — were seen nightly in New Jersey from dusk until 11 p.m., with sightings ranging from 4 to 180, according to state lawmakers who attended the briefing Wednesday.  The drones operate in a coordinated manner, turning off their lights to evade detection, complicating tracking efforts. They are not identified as hobbyist drones or linked to the Department of Homeland Security, State Assembly member Dawn Fantasia said on X.  The FBI is leading the investigation with the New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, while the US Coast Guard is assessing jurisdictional responses.  Federal agencies have ruled out any connections of local, state, or federal governments to the sightings.  Melham called for a temporary flight ban on all personnel and commercial drones in his video update, despite official advisories against such measures.  Concerns escalated after drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to military officials and state lawmakers. The sightings prompted the FAA to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.  Unnerved residents have described frequently seeing the drones hovering overhead, sometimes traveling in clusters.  While visiting family in New Jersey, travel content creator Katie Caf initially doubted reports of drones until she spotted several moving in a “zigzagging” pattern on Saturday. The 29-year-old noticed five potential drones, which she described as being the size of a bicycle. “They’re so weird looking and they’re much bigger than normal drones. I get why everyone is freaking out now … I think it’s kinda spooky.”  Fantasia said on X that the briefing occurred Wednesday at the New Jersey State Police headquarters and included descriptions of the aircraft’s movements and federal agencies’ response.  Though Murphy has said there is no known threat to the public, Fantasia and other local leaders have expressed doubt and are demanding more transparency into the investigation.  US Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, pushed for more information from federal investigators in a letter sent Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  “I recognize the need to maintain operational security of ongoing investigations and that this situation requires complex interagency coordination,” Booker wrote. “However, there is a growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state – from constituents and local officials alike – despite assurances that the drones pose no known threats to public safety.”  The FBI in Newark has asked the public to report any information related to the drones, including in several areas along the Raritan River.  “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI field office in Newark said December 3.  During a US Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday, Robert Wheeler, assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, called the phenomenon “concerning” but said “there is nothing that is known” that would lead him to identify a public safety risk.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/university-of-mississippi-student-killing-mistrial/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee: Judge declares mistrial after jury deadlocks over killing of gay University of Mississippi student,"AP —  A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the case of Sheldon “Timothy” Herrington Jr. in the 2022 killing of Jimmie “Jay” Lee, a gay man who was prominent in the LGBTQ+ community at the University of Mississippi.  Jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict after over nine and a half hours of deliberation.  Lee’s body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead.  Herrington, 24, showed little emotion as he left the courtroom with his attorneys and several relatives. He remains free on bond and is still charged with capital murder, which Mississippi law defines as a killing committed along with another felony — in this case, kidnapping. Prosecutors had said they would not seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison if he is tried again and convicted.  Jurors on Wednesday were told they could also consider lesser charges of first-degree murder, punishable by life in prison; second-degree murder, 20 years to life; or manslaughter, up to 20 years.  University of Mississippi student Jimmie ""Jay"" Lee is seen in this undated image. Oxford Police Police Department  Circuit Judge Kelly Luther said he will consult with prosecutors and defense attorneys about setting another trial.  Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee, 20, was pursuing a master’s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.  Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, where the university is located and the trial was held.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee vanished. Investigators testified that they used warrants to obtain electronic records including explicit messages between social media accounts belonging to the two men and online searches conducted by Herrington, including one inquiring how long it takes to strangle someone.  Prosecutors said during closing arguments Wednesday that Herrington and Lee had a sexual encounter that ended badly and Lee left Herrington’s apartment. They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex. Prosecutors said Lee was killed after going back.  “Tim Herrington lived a lie — lived a lie to his family,” District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. “He lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.”  Herrington’s attorney, Kevin Horan, has said prosecutors cannot prove Lee is dead without having a body. He told jurors Wednesday that text messages showed Herrington did not lure Lee to his apartment.  Judge Kelly Luther presides over the case of Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr. at the Lafayette County Courthouse in Oxford, Mississippi, on Wednesday. Bruce Newman/Pool/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal/AP  “He’s the one that’s being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,” Horan said of Lee.  Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.  Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained explicit messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.  Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched “how long does it take to strangle someone” at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.  The final text message from Lee’s phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington’s apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee’s phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee’s car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.  On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.  Herrington’s relatives sat behind him in the courtroom, and Lee’s sat behind prosecutors. When Luther dismissed court after the mistrial, he instructed the two groups to leave separately.  Jurors were chosen from another county about 250 miles to the south. They heard eight days of arguments and testimony.  The judge twice urged jurors to continue deliberating when they said they were deadlocked. After the third such message, Luther declared the mistrial and thanked them for serving, adding: “I’ve asked a lot of you.”",US,-0.9977
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/us/timeline-luigi-magione-ceo-shooting/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Timeline: Before and after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s killing,"CNN —  As investigators work to piece together the possible motive and movements of 26-year-old Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione, suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, here’s what we know.  This timeline is based on information from law enforcement sources, official police releases, surveillance images and social media records.  Summer of 2024  Mangione had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  During the summer, Mangione appears to stop posting online, prompting worried messages from some of his friends.  In July, one user posts on X, tagging Mangione, saying, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding.  Mid-November  Mangione’s mother reports her son missing in San Francisco, law enforcement officials said.  Sunday, November 24  10:11 p.m. – Mangione arrives in New York at the Port Authority bus terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue via a bus that originated in Atlanta, then gets into a cab that takes him to the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, where he stays about half an hour.  There was an interaction while the suspect was checking in at the hostel, making casual conversation. ""At some point, he pulled his mask down and smiled at the at the clerk,"" said Joseph Kenny, NYPD chief of detectives. NYPD  11 p.m. – He takes another cab to a hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave. on the Upper West Side, identified as HI New York City Hostel in charging documents.  11:20 p.m. - Surveillance footage from the hostel shows him checking in and showing a driver’s license, according to the arrest warrant in the case. Records from the hostel show he provided a New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario on it, the warrant says.  Friday, November 29  Mangione checks out of the hostel.  “It’s not your traditional check in, check out. It’s the kind of thing where if you don’t show up at a certain time, they automatically just check you out,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. “We don’t believe that he went someplace else. It’s more of an administrative checkout.”  Saturday, November 30  Mangione checks back into the hostel.  Wednesday, December 4  5:34 a.m. – Surveillance footage reviewed by law enforcement shows Mangione leaving the hostel, possibly by bike.  5:41 a.m. – He is seen wandering around the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown, on Sixth Avenue between West 53rd and 54th Streets, and goes back and forth for a bit before heading toward a Starbucks.  “We have him wandering around, walking in the vicinity of hotel, walking on 54th Street, walking back and forth,” Kenny said.  Around 6:17 a.m. – Images from Starbucks show him buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, according to a law enforcement official.  Image of the suspect at a Starbucks on Sixth Avenue. NYPD  6:19 a.m. – Surveillance video near a deli on West 55th Street appears to show him walking and briefly stopping by a pile of trash.  Gideon Platt, Stage Star Deli  6:30 a.m. – Around 6:30 a.m., surveillance video captures what appears to be the gunman on the phone.  Patrick Laborde  6:44 a.m. – Thompson, the victim, walks toward the Hilton after leaving his hotel across the street, police said.  The masked gunman is “lying in wait” outside the hotel as Thompson makes his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.  The gunman comes up behind Thompson and shoots him in the back, Kenny said. He then walks toward Thompson and continues to shoot, stopping to clear a gun jam before firing again.  Obtained by CNN  Investigators told CNN that after the shooting, the assailant crosses the street from the Hilton, flees northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street, and gets on an electric bike on 55th Street before heading north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.  Obtained by CNN  6:48 a.m. – Mangione is seen riding an electric bike into Central Park at 60th Street, according to Kenny.  NYPD  6:56 a.m. – He rides out of the park.  6:58 a.m. - He is seen on the bike at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue.  7:00 a.m. - He is no longer on the bike and is heading northbound on 86th Street.  7:04 a.m. - Mangione gets into a cab.  7:30 a.m. – He is seen near the George Washington Bridge and a Port Authority bus station off 178th Street.  Video shows the suspect entering the bus station.  “We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” Kenny said.  5-Day Manhunt  The suspect was in Pennsylvania for “several days” after the shooting in Manhattan, according to Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police.  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the suspect traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in Altoona, where he is arrested.  Monday, December 9  In a new post on social media, Pennsylvania State Police shared new images of Luigi Mangione sitting inside the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was captured on Monday. The images show Mangione eating what appears to be a hash brown inside the establishment. Pennsylvania State Police  9:14 a.m. - Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania are dispatched to a McDonald’s restaurant, after an employee tipped off police about someone resembling photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police.  9:58 a.m. - Mangione is taken into custody at the McDonald’s, where he presented police with a forged New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario as his identification – the same ID he presented at the hostel, according to the arrest warrant.  Mangione was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea in his first court appearance in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, later that day.  Mangione has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a firearm, according to charging documents released by New York prosecutors.",US,-0.9823

Ryan Borgwardt, 45, was booked into the Green Lake County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system, a service that provides information to crime victims such as a person’s jail custody status. No charges were listed.  The Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday in a social media post that a news conference would be held Wednesday morning to update the Borgwardt case. The post said no further information would be provided until then.  A person answering the phone at the sheriff’s office Tuesday night declined to confirm whether Borgwardt was in custody. County jail officials didn’t immediately return a phone message Tuesday night.  Last month, Sheriff Mark Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on November 11 after disappearing for three months but that he hadn’t committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were “pulling at his heartstrings” to come home. He suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance.  Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of “personal matters,” the sheriff said. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it’s the deepest in Wisconsin.  After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane.  The sheriff said at the time that investigators were working to verify Borgwardt’s description of what happened.  The sheriff’s office has said the search for Borgwardt’s body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn’t expect the search to last more than two weeks.",US,-0.9398

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-abc-news-defamation-lawsuit-settle/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,ABC News settles defamation suit with Trump for $15 million,"CNN —  ABC News will pay $15 million to a “presidential foundation and museum” in a settlement reached with President-elect Donald Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.  The settlement, which was filed publicly Saturday, reveals the network will also pay $1 million in Trump’s attorneys’ fees and will issue an apology.  ABC News will issue the following statement as an editor’s note on the online article at the center of the suit: “ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J. Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC’s This Week on March 10, 2024.”  “We are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,” an ABC News spokesperson wrote in a statement.  Trump filed the lawsuit in Florida federal court earlier this year, arguing that Stephanopoulos and ABC News defamed him when the anchor said 10 times during a contentious on-air interview with South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace in March that a jury found Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll.  Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and that he defamed her when he denied her claim. Trump has denied all wrongdoing toward Carroll.  In 2023, a jury found that Trump sexually abused Carroll, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, though it did not find that Carroll proved he raped her. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million for battery and defamation. In January, Carroll was awarded an additional $83.3 million in damages for defamatory statements made by Trump that disparaged her and denied her rape allegations.  A judge concluded in August 2023, when dismissing Trump’s countersuit against Carroll, that the claim Trump raped Carroll was “substantially true.” The judge wrote that Trump “raped” her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.  In the lawsuit filed against ABC News in March, Trump claimed that Stephanopoulos’ statements were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.”  A judge in July refused to dismiss Trump’s lawsuit against the network, writing that these definitions were different enough. He added that the case would turn on “whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury’s verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.”  The settlement came a day after a federal judge ruled that Trump and Stephanopoulos must sit for a deposition sometime next week. The president-elect can now avoid testifying under oath, which could have come with potential legal risks as he prepares to return to the White House.  Trump has a history of filing lawsuits against the news media. In late October, he filed a lawsuit against CBS, demanding $10 billion in damages over the network’s “60 Minutes” interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. His legal counsel claimed the interview with Harris and the associated programming were “partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference” intended to “mislead the public and attempt to tip the scales” of the presidential election in her favor.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-administration-big-donors/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Big donors secure big roles in the incoming Trump administration,"CNN —  Nearly three dozen of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks to serve in his incoming administration donated to his campaign or to the deep-pocketed outside groups that worked to elect him, a CNN analysis of federal campaign records shows.  They range from tech multibillionaire Elon Musk – who has emerged as the single largest, disclosed political donor of the 2024 presidential election – to others close to Trump tapped for key roles throughout government.  In all, eight of his Cabinet picks – led by Linda McMahon, the billionaire wrestling magnate Trump has selected to oversee the Education Department – and their spouses donated more than $37 million combined from their personal accounts to aid Trump, the review found, underscoring the proliferation of ultra-rich Americans now poised to shape US policy in the incoming second Trump administration.  (Two other Cabinet choices, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, transferred money from their campaign accounts to the pro-Trump effort.)  Musk has not been selected for a formal Cabinet job but is helping guide a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative and has played a pivotal role in the presidential transition – offering his views on job candidates, talking to world leaders and meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as he weighs how to downsize the federal government.  In all, the SpaceX and Tesla chief executive donated more than $277 million to federal elections this cycle, the lion’s share of which – more than $262 million – benefited Trump. Most of Musk’s pro-Trump dollars flowed to a super PAC that the world’s richest man created to help turn out voters on the Republican’s behalf in key swing states.  Outside of self-funded presidential candidates, no individual has donated more to shape federal contests in a single election cycle, said Brendan Glavin, research director of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes money in politics.  Trump’s donors “are not just getting these sort of plum ambassadorships on the side,” Glavin said. “Major donors are getting positions that affect policy.”  The CNN analysis researched the more than 90 people that Trump had announced for high-level positions in the administration through Tuesday, which marked five weeks since his election victory. More than 30 of them had donated to his campaign or to one of the leading Trump-aligned outside groups, the review of FEC records found.  “Millions of Americans fed up with failure in the White House and federal government joined President Trump in the movement to restore our nation’s greatness. Some who will work with President Trump are among those millions of people who supported the campaign and helped the President win a decisive electoral victory,” Brian Hughes, a Trump transition team spokesman, said in a statement in response to CNN’s inquiry about donors joining the administration.  The total donations from Trump’s current Cabinet picks marks a surge from Trump’s first term. Five members of his original Cabinet had donated nearly $8 million to his committees or to the major outside groups supporting him, a review of campaign reports shows.  Donations from McMahon, who served as Trump’s SBA administrator in his first White House term, accounted for more than 90% of that total in the 2016 election.  The sums spent to aid Trump in 2024 far exceed the donations that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet members contributed to help him win the White House in 2020, FEC records show.  A dozen members of Biden’s Cabinet reported donations to his campaign or major super PACs involved in the 2020 election, giving less than $100,000 in total.  Billionaires in the administration  Musk’s spending dwarfed that of other supporters.  McMahon was the largest donor among Trump’s Cabinet picks and the second most generous contributor, after Musk, among the administration members announced through Tuesday, the review found.  Most of the $21.2 million she donated went to Make American Great Again, Inc., the main Trump-affiliated super PAC that spent heavily on advertising to aid his campaign.  Other seven-figure donors among Trump’s Cabinet picks include Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick, whom Trump has tapped to serve as Commerce secretary; Scott Bessent, the hedge fund executive Trump has selected to oversee the Treasury Department; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, his choice to head the Small Business Administration.  Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher, also was a major donor, contributing more than $2 million to the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and Trump’s joint fundraising committee.  Sprecher is the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and was at Trump’s side when the president-elect rang the opening bell at the exchange Thursday.  In an email, Loeffler’s communication director Caitlin O’Dea said, “Senator Loeffler is proud to be one of President Trump’s strongest supporters for the same reason a historic landslide of Americans voted to put him back in the White House: he will restore American prosperity, security, and opportunity.”  The billionaire embrace marks a turnaround of sorts for Trump, who saw corporate America recoil from him after the violent January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And he has seen new support from tech leaders who are pushing for fewer regulations from the federal government.  The staggering sums spent by Musk in this year’s election helped Trump close the financial advantage of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who swiftly raised $1 billion after becoming her party’s standard-bearer in late July.  Super PACs face no limit on the size of donations they can receive or spend, but technically are not allowed coordinate their advertising decisions with the candidates they support.  However, a ruling this year by the FEC granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing efforts freed up Musk to guide a ground game for Trump.  “The campaign finance system is a joke,” said Fred Wertheimer, who heads the Democracy 21 watchdog group and is a longtime advocate for limits on money in politics. “Musk is the example now of how campaign finance laws have failed.”  He said he worries about government departments led by billionaires who have no “interest in doing the job that the agency was assigned.”  Musk did not respond to inquiries from CNN.  But Tom Davis, a former congressman from Virginia who chaired the House Republicans’ campaign arm for several years, argues “there is nothing inherently wrong about people who made a lot of money wanting to give back through government.”  “The fact that they have contributed shows a degree of loyalty,” he added.  Friends and family  Presidents often reward donors and allies with plum positions – often dispatching them to glamorous, low-conflict posts in Europe or the Caribbean.  Some of Trump’s early picks for ambassadorships follow that pattern and include billionaires who donated to his reelection effort. Among them: Arkansas investor Warren Stephens, named as the US’ envoy to the UK, and Charles Kushner, Trump’s choice for ambassador to France – one of several extended family members or close friends who has been chosen for diplomatic gigs.  Kushner, who donated $2 million to pro-Trump efforts and received a presidential pardon at the end of Trump’s first term, is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. Another donor, Tom Barrack, who oversaw the fundraising for Trump’s first inauguration, is his choice as ambassador to Turkey.  And incoming special envoy to the Middle East, real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff, is a longtime Trump friend and a partner in the cryptocurrency businesses that Trump launched with his sons earlier this year.  He donated $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC.",US,0.9994
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/antony-blinken-jordan-syria/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,"US has had direct contact with Syrian rebel group, Blinken says","Aqaba, Jordan CNN —  The United States has had direct contact with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Syrian rebel group now in de-facto control of the country, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday.  The first public confirmation of direct interaction with the US-designated terrorist group, known as HTS, came at the conclusion of Blinken’s diplomatic sprint through the region spurred by the sudden collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  “Yes, we’ve been in contact with HTS and the other parties,” Blinken said at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan. Blinken did not give details on when the contact was made or at what level. There is no legal barrier to speaking with a designated terrorist group.  “We have pressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,” Blinken said, referencing the American journalist who was detained in Syria more than a decade ago. The US has redoubled its efforts to find him in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse.  The US also shared the principles expected of a new Syrian government, including that the rights of all Syrians should be respected, that the country must not become a base for terrorism, that humanitarian aid must be delivered, and that chemical weapons stockpiles should be secured and safely destroyed.  Those principles, circulated by the US in the days after Assad’s shocking ouster, were further agreed upon in a joint statement by the US and a coalition of other countries at an urgent ministerial meeting in Aqaba on Saturday. Blinken said the agreement “sends a unified message to the new interim authority and parties in Syria.”  Ahead of the Saturday ministerial meeting, Blinken met with key partners in Jordan, Turkey and Iraq to garner consensus around the principles.  “America and our partners have an important stake in helping the Syrian people chart this new path,” the top US diplomat said Saturday. “We know what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders — from mass displacement to terrorism.”  “We can’t underestimate the challenges of this moment and the weeks and months ahead,” he added.  Throughout his trip, Blinken sought to emphasize those stakes. Moving forward, the dynamics on the ground in the region could present significant complications, despite a consensus on the principles.  There was an intense spate of fighting in recent weeks in northern Syria between Turkish-backed forces and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which the US sees as a key partner in the fight to keep ISIS degraded.  A fragile truce between the two sides in Manbij appears to be holding, but the fighting forced the SDF to halt its anti-ISIS operations, according to its top commander.  “This is a moment of vulnerability in which ISIS will seek to regroup, taking the advantage of transition in Syria,” Blinken said Saturday, reemphasizing the importance of the SDF.  In meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Ankara, Blinken warned the US does not want to see any party take actions that would allow ISIS to regroup, including by distracting the SDF from its mission to keep the terrorist group degraded and its fighters imprisoned, a US official said. Blinken also emphasized that nobody should take actions that could jeopardize factions in Syria from potentially coming together in a unified government.  In Baghdad, Blinken asked Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to crack down on the powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and to prevent Iran from transiting weapons through Iraq to Shia militias in Syria, the US official said. Such militias have targeted US personnel and interests in the past.  The response to Israel’s actions in Syria has also emerged as point of division between the US and its Arab partners.  Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has pummeled Syria with strikes and sent Israeli troops to — and beyond — a “buffer zone” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria, in what the United Nations said would be a violation of a 1974 agreement. Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Qatar have condemned Israel’s seizure of the buffer zone, calling it an attempted land grab.  The US, however, has not condemned the move, with Blinken saying that they are talking with the Israeli government.  “The stated purpose of those actions from the Israelis is to try to make sure that equipment that’s been abandoned — military equipment that’s been abandoned by the Syrian army — doesn’t fall into the wrong hands: terrorists, extremists, etc.,” he said Thursday. “But … we’re already talking with Israel; we’re all talking to others about the way ahead.”  A US official said Friday that Blinken intends to make clear to his Arab counterparts that Israel told the US that the incursion is temporary — and that the US expects it to be. That policy could change, however, next month when the Trump administration takes office, this official conceded.  This story has been updated with additional information.",US,-0.9886

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-ban-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,TikTok’s ban won’t be delayed. Here’s what you should know,"CNN —  TikTok has plans for another appeal as it faces a ban on January 19.  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected a temporary pause on the ban of TikTok, calling such a block “unwarranted” and paving the way for the Supreme Court to potentially decide the fate of the popular video-sharing app.  In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that required TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, to be sold to a non-Chinese company. The latest ruling follows last week’s decision by the same appeals court to uphold the law, citing national security concerns.  The Biden administration previously urged the appeals court not to issue a temporary block on the law, arguing that doing so might allow the company to wait months to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, effectively halting the law indefinitely.  “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said on December 6.  What will TikTok’s next appeal look like?  The Supreme Court could make a quick decision on the case. Both TikTok and the federal government previously asked the appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the January 19 ban.  But the Supreme Court, which has a six-justice conservative majority, seems likely to rule in favor of upholding the ban, Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN earlier this month.  “I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” Schiller said.  Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN earlier this month that the Supreme Court may decide not to review the case at all, in which case TikTok is out of luck.  Do you need to delete the app?  Not necessarily.  The Department of Justice said Wednesday that, if the ban takes effect, it would “not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok” for the app’s more than 170 million monthly users. But don’t expect any more updates from the app or the ability to download it, if the ban takes place.  Two leaders of the US House of Representatives’ committee on China sent a bipartisan letter to the CEOs of Apple and Google parent company Alphabet that said they should prepare to remove TikTok from their US app stores on January 19.  TikTok will also be unavailable on internet hosting platforms. The Justice Department warned users can expect the app to “eventually” be unworkable.  Can the ban be avoided?  There’s still some hope that TikTok could remain active in the United States, though ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell it.  The ban’s legislation leaves room for Biden to grant a one-time, 90-day extension if he determines a company has made progress toward a sale. He hasn’t suggested any plans to do so.  President-elect Donald Trump, who begins his term a day after the ban, could be on TikTok’s side. He said in July (in a video posted to the app) that he would “never ban TikTok” — although he did try to ban it during his first term.  There are a few options: Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, though experts say that’s unlikely to be successful. He could also direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month.",US,0.9622
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-shop-ban/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,TikTok Shop was going to be the next big thing. A potential ban could change that,"CNN —  Aakaanksh Autade was iffy on TikTok Shop, TikTok’s in-app shopping feature, when it launched last year. Then the content creator grossed over $100,000 in sales when he hosted a live event on Black Friday and went from skeptic to believer.  Autade is known for sharing tech-related tips and tricks on his TikTok channel, “kaansanity.” He took to TikTok Live for the first time on Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend to promote gadgets like headphones and game consoles. “It was my first time going live, and to make $102,000 in 10 hours was just insane. I didn’t expect it at all,” he said.  Aakaanksh Autade (left) promoted gadgets like the Nintendo Switch via TikTok Live on Cyber Monday. Courtesy Aakaanksh Autade/kaansanity  TikTok Shop allows users to buy and sell products without leaving the app. The sales platform combines entertainment and retail, making it particularly popular among Gen Z buyers, and it continues to grow. It has over 500,000 sellers in the US, including brands like L’Oréal, PacSun and Scrub Daddy.  TikTok Shop raked in $100 million in single-day sales this Black Friday — that’s triple the number from 2023, according to the company. Over Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend alone, the shop saw a 165% increase in shoppers year-over-year, according to a statement by the company this month.  However, a US appeals court this month upheld a law that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 or face a US ban.  That ban could grind the sales platform’s progress to a halt — but creators who spoke to CNN say that they’re sticking with TikTok Shop anyway because they don’t think a ban will actually happen.  “I don’t think TikTok is going anywhere. I think they’re going to figure it out, and there’s so many people invested in TikTok,” Autade said. “It’s hard to ignore how much it means to its users.”  What makes TikTok Shop tick?  TikTok Shop provides a pipeline from discovery to purchase by letting users shop products featured in live videos, pinned on brand and influencer profiles, or tagged in content shown on their algorithm-driven For You page.  Even before the launch of its shopping feature, TikTok had already established a reputation as a place for users to find items to add to their wishlists. A study conducted in 2022 by marketing consulting firm Material Plus found that 61% of users purchased an item after seeing content about it on TikTok, helped by hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which has over 12 million posts.  Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and TikTok creator, said combining passive entertainment with a shopping function can tempt users to open their wallets.  “You’ve got all these people who are spending so much time just being (on TikTok) consuming and creating content,” she said. “When you mix in commerce with our favorite source of entertainment, then we’re going to spend all our money there.”  TikTok Shop’s reliance on user-generated content allows consumers to hear from voices they trust.  Lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk says TikTok Shop's main draw is its ability to let consumers see their favorite influencers use the products they promote in real time. Courtesy Carrie Berk  Social media strategist Keenya Kelly says that TikTok Shop is another avenue for content creators to make money on TikTok without having to leave the app. Courtesy Keenya Kelly  “If you see your favorite creator promoting a product on a live stream or a video, you’re more likely to buy it in that moment,” said Carrie Berk, a lifestyle content creator. The thinking among viewers, she said, is that “if a makeup influencer is promoting a product on TikTok Shop, if she says it’s good, then it must be good.”  TikTok users like Autade also say that the app’s focus on short-form videos gives it an edge over other social media platforms.  “When I click on a product and I can see hundreds or even thousands of people posting a video about that product authentically, that really helps,” he said. “On a different platform, I might just see some words, some reviews, some stars here and there,” but seeing the product in action is different.  Another component of TikTok Shop’s growth is its popularity with younger users. Some 62% of Gen Z consumers say that TikTok is their platform of choice when they need to look something up, beating out search engines like Google, according to a report by marketing technology company SOCi published this year.  “Gen Z as a whole has really chosen TikTok as their premier destination for content,” said Jen Jones, chief marketing officer of e-commerce platform Commercetools. “TikTok shop just seemed like a natural place for those dollars to be spent.”  What would a TikTok ban mean for other social media retail platforms?  Social media shopping is not a new phenomenon.  Ninety-two percent of retailers plan to invest more in social commerce this holiday season, according to a study by Commercetools published in October. The same study showed that Facebook Marketplace was the social commerce platform of choice for businesses, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok Shop and X.  In particular, Jones sees an opportunity for YouTube to fill in the space TikTok could leave behind if a ban comes into force.  She says that YouTube could potentially meet demand for the style of short-form videos popularized by TikTok through YouTube Shorts while capitalizing on its longer-form content.  In the past year alone, people watched over 30 billion hours of shopping-related content on YouTube, the company previously told CNN in an email. In 2023, it launched YouTube Shopping, allowing content creators to tag products from brands featured in their videos and earn commissions.  Experts say that if the TikTok ban happens, it will serve as a lesson for brands to not put all their eggs into one marketing basket.  The Shop tab of the TikTok app is seen on an iPhone on June 23 in Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images  “It’s just really important for companies to have a very diversified strategy when it comes to social shopping,” said Jones. “We know that social shopping is here to stay. You can’t get locked into just one platform.”  Kelly says the same advice applies to individual content creators who make money off their posts and videos, and recommends cultivating a following through more direct forms of outreach like email lists.  “We use social media to reach a group of people,” she said. “You need to pull those people off social media onto email so that you have control over your business.”  Still, Kelly says she sees no reason for content creators to be concerned over the court ruling that moves TikTok one step closer to a ban.  “I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, she said. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.”  Berk commands an audience of almost 4 million followers on TikTok and describes the social media platform as a big part of her livelihood, but she says she’s not worried by the prospect of a total ban next month.  “There has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical,” she said.  Autade still has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, but he told CNN that TikTok was his primary marketing avenue and the platform that has brought him the most success.  Even as the threat of a ban looms nearer, he says it’s still business as usual and plans to continue with a live event in January similar to the one he hosted on Black Friday.  “I’m still all-in on TikTok. I’m still living my day-to-day life, running my businesses, and everything’s pretty much the same until I hear otherwise,” Autade said.",US,0.9961
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked.",US,0.2114
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/sony-stock-record/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Sony hasn’t been this hot since it made the Walkman,"CNN —  The last time Sony was worth this much on the stock market, Bill Clinton was president and the PlayStation 2 was about to debut on American store shelves.  It’s been a rough past two and a half decades for Sony, the 78-year-old company that invented the Walkman and the PlayStation and had long been an icon of consumer electronics. It largely missed the boat on the mobile phone revolution, and while the PlayStation has been profitable, production costs for other electronics have risen while demand has softened.  But as opportunities arise in streaming, Sony is trying to transition from being a legacy consumer electronics company to an original content and entertainment company.  The strategy is working: In the past three years, Sony’s stock (SONY) has started to break out of a decades-long slump. Sony’s stock price in Japan recently closed at the first record high since March 2000, signifying confidence in the company’s ability to evolve its game offerings and steer itself toward entertainment, Damian Thong, a research equity analyst at Macquarie, told CNN.  “If you went back 30 years ago, it was an electronics company, so best known as a seller of hardware,” Thong said. “But today, the company is primarily generating profits off of entertainment, which is games, music and (TV and movies).”  Less hardware, more content  Sony Group, Japan’s third largest company by market value, has turned itself around by innovating its games business beyond consoles and making acquisitions to expand its IP, Joost van Dreunen, an adjunct assistant professor at NYU Stern who teaches the business of video games, told CNN.  Sony acquired Anime powerhouse Crunchyroll in 2021, and it acquired American video game company Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion.  In addition to Sony Interactive Entertainment, which makes the PlayStation, the behemoth Sony Group also includes Sony Pictures, which produces films like the Spider-Man series, and Sony Music, which includes Columbia Records.  Sony is trying to unlock synergy across its subsidiary companies to produce original entertainment content for consumers, van Dreunen said.  Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal in the first season of ""The Last of Us."" Liane Hentscher/HBO  That strategy of leveraging its intellectual property across its brands became apparent at the 75th Emmy Awards in January, when the TV series “The Last of Us” won eight primetime awards. It was the first time a TV show adapted from a videogame earned major consideration at a Hollywood awards ceremony.  It was a momentous occasion for Sony, which first published “The Last of Us” as a videogame in 2013 before it was adapted to become a TV series released in 2023 on HBO and Max. (HBO and Max share ownership with CNN.)  Without a streaming network of its own, licensing its intellectual property and original content is part of Sony’s strategy to compete with streaming giants like Netflix, Disney and Amazon.  Robert Lawson, the chief communications officer for Sony Group, said in a statement that since 2018 when the company acquired EMI publishing, making Sony Music the world’s largest publisher of music, Sony has invested approximately 1.5 trillion yen into content IP across various entertainment businesses.  “Sony Group has shifted its corporate strategies towards strengthening its creation and entertainment assets,” Lawson said, noting the company is focusing on “new collaborations between Sony sister companies,” including leaning heavily into the anime genre.  In the last fiscal year ending March, Sony’s entertainment business, which includes music, movies and games, accounted for 60% of total revenue. That’s double from a decade ago, when the entertainment business accounted for just 30% of total revenue.  A long road to dominance  Doubling down on entertainment represents a departure from Sony’s origins.  Before there was Sony, there was Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, founded in 1946 by Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka. The company released Japan’s first-ever magnetic tape record in 1950. In 1958, the company changed its name to Sony Corporation.  In the 1960s, Sony established its business in the United States. For the next three decades, the Japanese company emerged as a household name in consumer electronics, producing iconic devices from the Trinitron color TV in 1968 to the Walkman cassette player in 1979 to the world’s first CD player in 1982, in addition to numerous cameras and video recorders.  Sony has also been involved with music since the 1960s through a joint venture with CBS that became Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Yet it’s largely been known for its electronics.

Aflo/Shutterstock  The 1990s were a high point for Sony as it broke into the world of gaming consoles. With the release of the PlayStation in 1994, Sony disrupted the arcade and gaming industry.  Since the 1990s, Sony has been a dominant player in the videogame console business with iterations of the PlayStation. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, which has consistently outsold its main competitors like Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Nintendo’s Switch, according to data from Ampere Analysis, an analytics firm for the games business.  Van Dreunen said that Sony is also looking to evolve in gaming beyond its console business, looking for new audiences and methods of distribution.  “We’re currently going through a softer period in gaming, and so it really raises the stakes for companies like, what’s next?” he said. “How do you as the dominant console maker continue to innovate and continue to grow your business?”  An original PlayStation is pictured at a display of various memorabilia in the lobby of the Sony headquarters building in central Tokyo on November 27, 2024.

Brooks/AFP/Getty Images  A customer walks away after purchasing the new Sony Playstation PS5 in Seoul on November 12, 2020, after Sony launched the new console in select markets around the world. Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images  Thong said that Sony has been successful in becoming a profitable channel for third-party publishers to sell videogames.  Sony has tried to diversify its strategy toward gaming, including publishing a videogame called Helldivers 2 across PlayStation5 and also PC. Helldivers 2 was a hit for Sony and sold over 12 million copies within three months of its release, according to Anna Kerr, a research manager for games at Ampere Analytics.  “The games business is spreading out its IP,” NYU Stern’s van Dreunen said. “It’s looking for new ways to reach customers, to expand that customer reach.”  In November, Sony announced a 69% percent jump in net quarterly profit, driven in part by its game segment. The company has had consistently strong quarters this year, driven by profitability in its games.  The company is now in talks to acquire Kadokawa, a Japanese videogame powerhouse that produces the popular videogame “Elden Ring,” according to people familiar with the matter.  There have been some headwinds: Sony’s rollout of the “Concord” vieogame and Sony Pictures’ latest installment of the Spider-Man universe were largely flops among fans this year. However, they are trial and error runs, van Dreunen said, and manageable expenditures for a company that has denoted 1.8 trillion yen ($11 billion) for acquisitions and stock buybacks through March 2027.  In May, at Sony’s annual investor conference, Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida said that the company was embracing a “creative entertainment vision.”  Sony’s emergence as an entertainment company was not always certain, Thong said.  “Sony had some years of quite substantial pain, I would say,” Thong said. “And I think to their credit, they managed to weather and see through it.”  Bringing Sony IP to the big screen  Van Dreunen said in the past, there wasn’t as much demand for videogame adaptations for movie and TV. Yet “The Last of Us” showed that Sony had an opportunity to bring more Sony IP to the big screen.  Before “The Last of Us,” Sony also tried its hand at videogame adaptation with “Uncharted,” a 2022 movie featuring actor Tom Holland that was based on a video game franchise first published by Sony in 2007.

Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg/Getty Images  Additionally, Sony is planning to adapt videogame franchise “God of War,” which it first published in 2005, to the big screen next year, Kerr said.  Sony is still in the electronics business, Thong said, noting its image sensors business works with companies like Apple and it produces high-end cameras. However, it has shed its identity as a mass consumer electronics company.  In 2025, Sony intends to spin off its online banking and insurance units, further doubling down on its entertainment offerings.  Sony’s stock is up almost 18% in the past month, outpacing entertainment heavyweights like Disney and Netflix, and boosted from investors piling into the Nasdaq, which crossed 20,000 for the first time this week.",US,0.9996
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/business/unitedhealthcare-insurance-denials-change/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,UnitedHealth Group CEO: America’s health system is poorly designed,"CNN —  In his first public response to the consumer outcry following the fatal shooting of one of his top executives, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said Friday that the US health system “is not perfect” and that coverage decisions “are not well understood.”  “We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people’s frustrations with it,” Witty wrote in a guest essay in the New York Times. “No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It’s a patchwork built over decades.”  Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.  “Together with employers, governments and others who pay for care, we need to improve how we explain what insurance covers and how decisions are made,” Witty wrote. “Behind each decision lies a comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety.”  Witty also praised UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was killed in midtown Manhattan last week, writing that Thompson “fought for preventive health and quality health outcomes rather than simply adding ever more tests and procedures.”  In a statement on Friday, UnitedHealthcare said “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company’s treatment of insurance claims” and that it “approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission,” noting that “around one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons.”  Will changes be made?  Thompson’s fatal shooting pushed Americans’ dissatisfaction with their health insurance into the spotlight. Many have made their frustrations abundantly clear on social media.  Journalists have also chronicled insurers’ efforts to twist the system to their benefit. STAT, a news site that focuses on health care, has published a series of investigative stories on UnitedHealth, including articles on how the nation’s largest health insurer uses a computer algorithm to cut off rehabilitation care for Medicare enrollees, limiting clinical case managers’ discretion.  Whether the public outcry prompts UnitedHealthcare and other insurers to adjust their practices — particularly the much-maligned denials of treatment and claims — or pushes lawmakers to force the industry to make changes remains to be seen. It depends, in part, on whether patients continue making their voices heard, experts say.  Angry consumers have had success in overhauling the health insurance industry in the past. They railed against the restrictions of health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, in the 1990s, as captured in the 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” That helped spur insurers to offer more preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, which have fewer constraints but are more costly.  Any shifts in the nation’s complex health care system, however, will not come easily, nor quickly, experts say. There are many players involved, each of which has its own patient care concerns, financial interests and lobbying dollars to influence lawmakers.  UnitedHealthcare’s mission  While many patients and their advocates argue that insurers deny care to pad their profits, the industry maintains that it is protecting consumers from high prices and unnecessary care.  Soon after Thompson’s murder, Witty vowed in an internal message to employees to continue the insurer’s mission of helping “the system improve.”  “Our role is a critical role, and we make sure that care is safe, appropriate, and it’s delivered when people need it,” said Witty in a video message obtained by CNN. “And we guard against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex and ultimately unsustainable. So we’re going to continue to make that case.”  “What we know to be true is that the health system needs a company like UnitedHealth Group,” he continued.  Asked Thursday whether it will make any changes in response to consumers’ public complaints, UnitedHealthcare referred CNN to Witty’s video. Other major insurers either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment, but a leading industry association said that hospitals, providers and employers all have “a direct impact on the cost and accessibility of medical services.”  “In the fragmented and heavily regulated health care system, health plans, providers and drugmakers share a responsibility to make high-quality care as affordable as possible and easier to navigate for the people we collectively serve,” AHIP, the trade group, said in a statement. “Health plans are working to protect patients from the full impact of rising costs while connecting them to care that is safe, evidence-based and coordinated.”  But the recent events may prompt insurers to investigate their practices and make some changes, Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in an email to CNN. This is especially likely if they see risks to their businesses, such as if employers threaten to leave because coverage decisions are too onerous for their workers.  On the flip side, “the main reason to not change their practices is to maintain their profitability while also keeping costs reasonable in a broad sense for their clients and end users,” Utterback wrote.  Video Ad Feedback Scott Galloway says online rage directed at health care CEOs is directed at the wrong people. Hear why. 01:43 - Source: CNN  The HMO backlash  Though former President Bill Clinton failed to reform health care in the early 1990s, his administration’s efforts spurred increased concerns over the cost of care. That cued the growth of the HMO model, which allowed policyholders to see only certain doctors and required referrals from primary care physicians to see specialists and get certain tests and procedures. But HMOs also typically featured low premiums, low or no co-pays and no deductibles.  Policyholders rebelled because they felt they couldn’t access the care they needed, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.  Their angst was captured in extensive media coverage and in the 1997 film “As Good As It Gets,” when a young boy’s mother (played by Helen Hunt) tells a doctor (played by Harold Ramis) that her insurer would not cover an allergy test for her son’s asthma.  “F**king HMO, bastard pieces of sh*t,” Hunt says, before apologizing.  “That’s ok. Actually, I think that’s their technical name,” Ramis replies.  Many states responded to the complaints by passing patients’ bills of rights that limited HMO cost-control practices in state-regulated plans. Employers, who were hearing from angry workers, began shifting to PPOs, which generally provide coverage for a wider range of doctors but have much higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. PPOs have now largely eclipsed the managed care model.  But as health care costs continue to skyrocket, PPOs are instituting practices that resemble those of HMOs, particularly requiring approval of care in advance, known as prior authorization, Levitt said.  “If you think health care costs are rough now, imagine them without constraints,” said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+, a health care consulting group, and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.  Health insurers, however, do at times backtrack when faced with intense blowback. Earlier this month, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield halted its plan to limit the amount of time it would cover anesthesia used in surgeries and procedures after criticism from doctors and politicians. The policy was designed to reduce overbilling and make care more affordable, the insurer had said.  Efforts in Congress  Congress has tried for years to improve access to care and curtail costs, which are far higher in the US than in its peers even though it ranks last on key health measures. Lawmakers have held hearings and introduced bills, but there haven’t been comprehensive reforms enacted since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 — aside from several significant Medicare drug cost provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.  An effort to improve the prior authorization process in Medicare Advantage plans failed to advance in the Senate in 2022 after the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost about $16 billion over a decade.  However, there is now more bipartisan appetite on Capitol Hill to enact reforms, said Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive and vocal critic of the health care industry. Lawmakers reintroduced the prior authorization bill, which now comes with a zero cost estimate, and released a framework to establish so-called site-neutral payments in Medicare, under which Medicare would pay the same rate for a service provided in a hospital outpatient department, an ambulatory surgical center or physician’s office.  Plus, lawmakers are looking at reforms to the pharmacy benefit manager industry, which serves as a middleman between health insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers.  Republicans, who will control Congress starting in January, will be looking for cost savings to offset extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Whitlock said. That could push them to pass measures that would save the government money, such as site-neutral payments.  Meanwhile, the murder of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO will remain in the news as the case against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, winds its way through the court system. That will keep public frustration with health insurers in the spotlight – and could help advance legislation on Capitol Hill, Potter said.  “It will be a years long fight, but it’s going to happen,” he said. “Some kind of reform is inevitable.”",US,0.9982

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads. Try and win an argument with any woman in Canada,” he said. “We’re pretty tough and resilient people.”",US,-0.7272

(AP) — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.  Advertisement  This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what’s behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  More drone sightings have been reported in New York City, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials. And then President-elect Donald Trump posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  This photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. (Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.  Advertisement  “Whether or not it’s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I’m saying is it’s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,” he added.  ___",US,0.9502

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia’s opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.  The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.  ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

Advertisement  “You can’t just be the resistance,” he said. “Be the voice against crazy and injustice and unfairness. But go in there and find places that you can work with Republicans to get things done.”  Asked what advice he would give Democrats, Tony Fabrizio of Fabrizio Ward, President-elect Donald Trump’s chief pollster, said: “Stop being prisoners to your own special interests.  “They’re more worried about their base and honestly they went too far,” Fabrizio told a reporter roundtable organized by the AARP. (Fabrizio emphasized that he was speaking as a pollster for the interest group for older Americans and not for the Trump campaign.) “One of the reasons why the ad we did about the trans thing worked was the tagline: Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”  Advertisement  Fabrizio was referencing what was widely considered one of the most effective yet polarizing ads of the 2024 election, which seized on a clip in which Harris expressed support for taxpayer-funded transgender surgery for prison inmates. Anzalone and Fabrizio agreed the footage, from Harris’ 2019 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, was a gift to Republicans and Trump.  Democrats are still divided on why Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Getty Images  “We’ve gotten to a point in society where if you disagree with something like that, you’re the extremist, you’re out of the mainstream,” Fabrizio said. “And in my opinion Democrats, particularly Democrats in D.C., are very much captive of that political correctness that the rest of the country just doesn’t get. And actually it’s off-putting to the rest of the country.”  Advertisement  Both pollsters agreed the economy was the driving factor in this year’s election — and that Trump crafted a more compelling economic message to woo undecided voters.  “Watching every TV ad in every battleground state, I think [the Trump campaign] did a brilliant job of the economic narrative on the cost of living,” Anzalone said.  The party is divided on where Harris ultimately fell short on Election Day, resulting in the loss of every swing state and the national popular vote — a first for the party since 2004. Democrats including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont believe the party further abandoned a jilted working class, while others downplayed the overall degree of its losses.  Advertisement  Anzalone and Fabrizio also agreed that, despite an early surge following Harris’ replacement of President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, the Trump campaign did a better job defining Harris using mostly her own words.  “I think the sugar high never put into the equation the pushback that ... when she ran in 2019, she was the most liberal candidate of what, 17 candidates? That’s not a criticism, that’s just where she was. And those interviews came back,” Anzalone said.  And yet, Anzalone — Biden’s longtime pollster — said Democratic losses would have been far more devastating had Biden remained the nominee.  Advertisement  “I’m a Biden guy. I’ve been working for him since I was 22. I love the man,” he said. “But if Joe Biden was the nominee, I think we lose [Michigan Sen.-elect] Elissa Slotkin. I think we lose [Wisconsin Sen. Tammy] Baldwin. I think we lose [Nevada Sen. Jacky] Rosen. … I actually think we probably would have lost Arizona [in the U.S.] Senate.”  The political climate, however, can shift dramatically over the next two years, giving Democrats an opening.  “America is kind of pissed off right now,” Anzalone said. “Don’t think they’re joyous about Republicans. They were just a little less joyous about Democrats … this was still a lesser of two evils election.”",US,0.9652

There is no mechanism to deport U.S. citizens, regardless of their parent’s status.  When asked how mass deportation would impact America’s roughly 4 million mixed-status families, President-elect Donald Trump said, ""The only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back."" Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images  It also remains to be seen whether Trump’s bluster is just an off-the-cuff remark from someone with a hazy grasp of the details or will amount to actual policy. Tom Homan, who headed Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump in 2017 and has been tapped to serve as his “border czar,” made a similar claim in an interview with “60 Minutes” in October, then tried to walk back his comments in a later interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity.  Advertisement  But if Homan and Trump are serious about removing American citizen children along with their parents, they’ll face one major hurdle: ICE won’t have the authority to do so.  “This is blatantly illegal territory,” said Azadeh Erfani, policy director for the National Immigrant Justice Center. “They have no jurisdiction to deport U.S. citizens — children or adults.”  Instead, legal experts say that Trump and Homan are issuing threats to create a climate of fear while laying the groundwork for a campaign to pressure unauthorized immigrants to return to their home countries on their own, taking families that may include U.S. citizens with them.  Advertisement  “You cannot deport U.S. citizens,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. “However, when faced with the deportation of family members, families might make difficult choices about whether to leave the country with their relatives.”  In some ways, Trump’s comments simply reflect the reality of removal proceedings. Deportation has always put parents of American citizen children in the agonizing position of choosing between leaving their kids behind or bringing them to a country they had reason to leave.  “Even under current policies and practices, it’s not uncommon that U.S. citizen children are effectively deported when their parents are deported and there aren’t good options for their children,” Denise Gilman, a law professor who directs the University of Texas at Austin Immigration Clinic, told HuffPost. “We see that all the time.”  Advertisement  But while deportation has always threatened to either tear families apart or force American kids into removal along with a parent, having a president come to office promising to target families — especially ones with U.S.-born kids — puts the United States on a new course.  “Everybody is going to be really afraid,” Gilman said.  The Obama administration sharply blunted the impact of deportation on mixed-status families with the implementation of a prosecutorial discretion policy in 2011 that limited enforcement against unauthorized migrants in removal proceedings who did not have serious criminal records but did have significant ties to the United States, including U.S. citizen or permanent resident children, parents or spouses.    Deportations from the interior of the United States plummeted from a peak of 223,755 in 2010, Barack Obama’s second year in office, to 65,332 in his last year in 2016, largely due to prosecutorial discretion.  Advertisement  Trump scrapped his predecessor’s discretion policy in his first term, but President Joe Biden reimplemented it the day he took office. Trump is expected to do away with prosecutorial discretion once again next month.  With neither the resources nor the legal authority to remove U.S. citizens, ICE may explore other options. They may affix ankle monitors to unauthorized immigrants with American-born children and tell them to arrange to return to their home country on their own, according to David Leopold, a partner at UB Greensfelder’s immigration law practice.  “They’ll say, ‘Come back and show us you got a plane ticket’ — it’s easier and cheaper for ICE to do it that way,” Leopold told HuffPost. “For all intents and purposes, they were deported with their parents, but you have the legal fiction of them leaving voluntarily.”  Advertisement  Trump’s attacks on U.S.-born children are also laying the groundwork for his broadside against birthright citizenship, Leopold said — the constitutionally protected standard of recognizing those born within the United States as American citizens.",US,0.8175

Johnson, when asked how “complicated” it’d be for the president-elect to roll out the deportation plan, told host Kristen Welker that someone should pass a law banning executive orders on the first day of a new administration.  “Because the reality is executive orders drafted by transition teams without the input of the affected agency before the Cabinet secretary is even confirmed are not great ideas,” Johnson explained.  Advertisement  He then referred to Trump’s travel ban in 2017, a move that barred people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, before pointing fingers at himself.  “I was involved in the transition 16 years ago and Guantanamo Bay is still open,” noted Johnson of Obama issuing an executive order to close the facility in the early days of his first term.  He stressed the need for “enforcement priorities” in an administration regardless of who is president.  Advertisement  “Start with the criminals, start with the national security threats, recent border crossers. Tom Homan knows that. I know he knows that because he used to work for me,” said Johnson of Trump’s pick to be “border czar” in his second term.  He continued, “And I’d rather see ERO go after the criminals versus somebody who’s been in this country 12 years, committed no crimes, has children who are U.S. citizens. And that’s the reality of enforcement and that’s — I’m sure that will be the reality of enforcement even under a President Trump.”  Enforcement and Removal Operations, or ERO, is the division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) responsible for the arrest and removal of undocumented immigrants.  Advertisement  Moments later, Welker told the show’s panel that it could be a “little bit tougher” for Trump to tackle his agenda as Republicans control the House by a “very narrow margin.”  Stephen Hayes, editor of The Dispatch, said this could make it “somewhat tenuous” for Trump.  “But I think that argues in favor of Donald Trump being aggressive on executive actions,” he added.  “He said he ran on tariffs. He ran on mass deportations. We know that these are issues that he cares about viscerally in a way that he doesn’t care about some other issues viscerally.

The Monday decision partially reversed a 2023 preliminary injunction that blocked enforcement of the state’s abortion trafficking law on First Amendment grounds. Although some national abortion rights groups described the ruling as “devastating for young people in Idaho,” an attorney for the pro-choice plaintiffs in the case told HuffPost on Friday there was one major victory in the ongoing case.  Advertisement  The Monday decision is only a small part of a larger case surrounding the state’s so-called “abortion trafficking” law. Litigation is currently ongoing and the merits of the case have yet to be argued. The law is not currently in effect.  The law, signed last year by Gov. Brad Little (R), created a new felony called “abortion trafficking,” defined as when an “adult ... with the intent to conceal an abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant, unemancipated minor, either procures an abortion … or obtains an abortion-inducing drug” for that minor. “Abortion trafficking” also involves “recruiting, harboring, or transporting” a pregnant minor for an abortion, the law states. Violations are punishable by two to five years in prison.  The law’s sweeping language seeks to criminalize anyone transporting a pregnant minor without parental consent with the intent to get an abortion, or any adult offering counseling to a pregnant minor on the minor’s reproductive health options.  Advertisement  Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a vocal opponent of abortion, called the ruling a “tremendous victory” in a press release.  “Idaho’s laws were passed specifically to protect the life of the unborn and the life of the mother,” Labrador said. “Trafficking a minor child for an abortion without parental consent puts both in grave danger, and we will not stop protecting life in Idaho.”  The court’s ruling said that the state can enforce the “harboring” and “transporting” part of the law, but it cannot enforce the “recruiting” statute. The anti-abortion Republicans who wrote the law did not define “recruiting,” which the appeals court found to be “unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expressive speech.”  Advertisement  This part of the ruling was a “huge victory,” said Wendy Heipt, an attorney for the plaintiffs. It’s the first abortion case at the federal level to acknowledge a person’s right to freely discuss abortion even if obtaining care is illegal in a person’s home state.  “I can’t stress enough how important it is that the most vulnerable people in Idaho ― which are minors in situations that are unsafe or violent ― can now actually turn to trusted adults and learn what their options are,” Heipt told HuffPost.  Raul Labrador, Idaho's attorney general, speaks outside the US Supreme Court earlier this year. Labrador has advocated for an interstate abortion ban travel as well as banning health-stabilizing abortions for women in medical emergencies. Bloomberg via Getty Images  Advertisement  The panel of judges effectively said Idaho cannot criminalize people who are simply providing information about abortion, including educational counseling, encouragement or how to logistically or financially obtain abortion care. Idahoans are protected by free speech to talk to anyone, including minors, about abortion care ― even if abortion is largely illegal in the state, the court ruled.  The judges used a hypothetical situation in their ruling to portray how slippery the slope would be if the state could prosecute people for “recruiting” minors under this law:  “Imagine an Idaho resident who lives near the border of Oregon and displays a bumper sticker that reads: ‘Legal abortions are okay, and they’re right next door. Ask me about it!’ A minor sees the sticker and, feeling desperate, approaches the driver to request a ride across state lines. ‘I need an abortion,’ the minor says, ‘and my parents can’t know.’ The driver says: ‘I’m sorry, I can’t drive you there. But, here, take this cash. That should cover the procedure.’ The minor takes the cash, finds a ride to Oregon with another minor, and gets a legal abortion with the money the driver provided. Under Section 18-623, the driver might be prosecuted for ‘recruiting.’ The driver’s expression invited contact, causing the minor to approach and find out how to get a legal abortion. The bumper sticker, and perhaps the offer of cash, arguably persuaded or even induced the minor to have the abortion. The cash also paid for, or ‘procured,’ the abortion. Thus, the driver procured an abortion for the minor, in part by recruiting.”  The ruling on the “recruiting” provision sets some kind of legal standard for other states looking to pass similar laws. Tennessee passed a similar law this year that is currently blocked with a preliminary injunction, and Republicans in Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi introduced similar abortion trafficking laws in 2024 that failed. A New Hampshire Republican has already filed a similar abortion travel ban for the state’s upcoming legislative session.  The court’s decision on the recruitment statute also offers some legal basis for future attacks on pro-choice groups that provide abortion counseling or financial aid for abortion.  Advertisement  “Idahoans should be concerned and upset about what the legislators are doing and what the law still does ― absolutely,” Heipt said. “But they should be so relieved that they can still talk about and support abortion.”  Read the 9th Circuit’s decision below:  This article was updated throughout with quotes from Heipt to better reflect the impact of Monday’s ruling.",US,-0.1637

Of the 10 states where abortion rights were on the ballot on Tuesday, seven voted to expand or enshrine abortion rights. The results are emblematic of what pro-choice advocates have been saying for decades: Abortion rights are widely popular.  In the biggest win of the night, deep-red Missouri decided to codify abortion protections into the state constitution. The measure will repeal the state’s near-total abortion ban and restore access until around 24 weeks of pregnancy — marking the first time since Roe v. Wade fell that voters have overturned an abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest.  Advertisement  Voters in Maryland and Colorado supported amendments to enshrine abortion access throughout pregnancy — a progressive win in states that have become safe havens for abortion care later in pregnancy. Notably, Colorado’s amendment also repeals a 1984 state law that barred the use of public funds for abortion care.  Arizona, Montana and Nevada all voted to pass amendments that codify abortion through fetal viability, or around 24 weeks of pregnancy, into the state constitution.  New Yorkers passed a historic amendment to expand the state’s equal rights amendment to include pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. The amendment also includes protections against discrimination based on ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.  Advertisement  People at an election night watch party react after an abortion rights amendment in Missouri passed. AP Photo/Charlie Riedel  Three states — Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota — voted against abortion rights. A slim majority of Nebraska voters supported an anti-abortion amendment to codify the state’s current 12-week abortion ban, beating out the state’s competing abortion rights measure.  Florida’s outcome was particularly heartbreaking for pro-choice groups because a majority of Floridians (57%) supported the amendment, voting to restore abortion access until fetal viability. But because voters didn’t meet the state’s 60% threshold for amending the state constitution, Amendment 4 did not pass.  Advertisement  “The reality is because of Florida’s constitution a minority ― a minority ― a minority of Florida voters have decided that Amendment 4 will not be adopted,” Lauren Brenzel, director of the Yes On 4 campaign, said during her Tuesday night concession speech.  “Republicans, Democrats and Independents do not support these extreme bans on abortion. They are tired of women dying because of abortion bans,” she continued. “...A bipartisan group of voters today sent a clear message to the Florida legislature.”  Despite 7 out of 10 states voting to protect abortion care, voters still supported a presidential candidate who will very likely decimate women’s reproductive health care. Donald Trump may have shied away from his anti-abortion record on the campaign trail, but now that he’s headed to the White House, those guardrails will likely fall by the wayside.  Advertisement  Trump has waffled on a national abortion ban, but many of his allies laid out a blueprint for how to ban abortion nationwide in Project 2025.  A federal abortion ban would trump state rights, including the abortion rights measures that seven states passed last night, according to Mary Ziegler, an expert in reproductive health law at the University of California, Davis, School of Law. The Comstock Act, an archaic law that bans the mailing of abortion pills, would also likely supersede state rights if Trump enforces it as a national abortion ban.  Although the GOP won control of the Senate, control of the House — and with it, Trump’s ability to pass a national abortion ban through Congress — is still up in the air.  Advertisement  “Yet again, the people have spoken loudly and clearly: abortion is health care, and politicians do not deserve the right to make people’s medical decisions,” Pro-Choice Caucus co-chairs Reps. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said in Wednesday statement.  “In the months and years to come, there is no doubt we face a daunting path to securing reproductive freedom nationwide,” the statement continues. “We are clear-eyed about the threats ahead, from emboldened Republican extremists to a hostile White House and administration. We believe in a future of reproductive freedom for every American, and we will never stop fighting for you.”  There will be litigation in every state that passed an abortion rights amendment on Tuesday night.

But their impact was barely noticeable in the overall economy, even if their aftershocks were clear in specific industries.  The data show they never fully delivered on his promised factory jobs. Nor did they provoke the avalanche of inflation that critics feared.  Advertisement  This time, though, his tariff threats might be different.  The president-elect is talking about going much bigger — on a potential scale that creates more uncertainty about whether he’ll do what he says and what the consequences could be.  “There’s going to be a lot more tariffs, I mean, he’s pretty clear,” said Michael Stumo, the CEO of Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that has supported import taxes to help domestic manufacturing.  The president-elect posted on social media Monday that on his first day in office he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada until those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States.  Advertisement  Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. But on Wednesday, Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) via Associated Press  Trump also posted on Monday that Chinese imports would face additional tariffs of 10% until Beijing cracks down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl.  Advertisement  Democrats and business groups warn of risks from Trump’s tariff threats  Business groups were quick to warn about rapidly escalating inflation. House Democrats put together legislation to strip a president’s ability to unilaterally apply tariffs this drastic, warning that they would likely lead to higher prices for autos, shoes, housing and groceries.  Sheinbaum initially said Wednesday that her administration is already working up a list of possible retaliatory tariffs “if the situation comes to that.” Similarly, the Canadian government has also started to explore retaliatory tariffs if Trump takes action.  House Democrats on Tuesday introduced a bill that would require congressional approval for a president to impose tariffs due to claims of a national emergency, a largely symbolic action given Republicans’ coming control of both the House and Senate.  Advertisement  “This legislation would enable Congress to limit this sweeping emergency authority and put in place the necessary Congressional oversight before any president – Democrat or Republican – could indiscriminately raise costs on the American people through tariffs,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash.  Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, President of Mexico, speaks during a briefing conference about the rescue of Mexican Petroleum (PEMEX), at the National Palace.

Advertisement  The tariffs he imposed on China in his first term were continued by President Joe Biden, a Democrat who even expanded tariffs and restrictions on the world’s second largest economy. Biden administration officials looked at removing Trump’s tariffs in order to bring down inflationary pressures, only to find they were unlikely to help significantly.  Tariffs were “so new and unique that it freaked everybody out in 2017,” said Stumo, but they are now seen as part of the policy toolkit by the United States and other countries.  Trump’s first term tariffs had a modest impact on economy  Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines at the start of 2018, moves that might have pushed up prices in those sectors even though they also overlapped with plans to open washing machine plants in Tennessee and South Carolina.  Advertisement  His administration also levied tariffs on steel and aluminum, including against allies. He then increased tariffs on China, leading to a trade conflict and a limited 2020 agreement that failed to produce the promised Chinese purchases of U.S. goods.  Still, the dispute changed relations with China as more U.S. companies looked for alternative suppliers in other countries. Economic research also found the United States may have sacrificed some of its “soft power” as the Chinese population began to watch fewer American movies.  The Federal Reserve kept inflation roughly on target, but factory construction spending never jumped in a way that suggested a lasting gain in manufacturing jobs. Separate economic research found the tariff war with China did nothing economically for the communities hurt by offshoring, but it did help Trump and Republicans in those communities politically.  Advertisement  When Trump first became president in 2017, the federal government collected $34.6 billion in customs, duties and fees. That sum more than doubled under Trump to $70.8 billion in 2019, according to Office of Management and Budget records.  While that sum might seem meaningful, it was relatively small compared with the overall economy. America’s gross domestic product is now $29.3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The total tariffs collected in the United States would equal less than 0.3% of GDP.  Trump wants much more far-reaching tariffs going forward  The new tariffs being floated by Trump now are dramatically larger and there could be far more significant impacts.  Advertisement  If Mexico, Canada, and China faced the additional tariffs proposed by Trump on all goods imported to the United States, that could be roughly equal to $266 billion in tax collections, a number that does not assume any disruptions in trade or retaliatory moves by other countries. The cost of those taxes would likely be borne by U.S. families, importers and domestic and foreign companies in the form of higher prices or lower profits.  Former Biden administration officials said they worried that companies could piggyback on Trump’s tariffs — if they’re imposed — as a rationale to raise their prices. This would mirror price increases by many companies in 2022 that were made possible because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy prices and gave the companies cover to further raise their own prices.  “I’m very worried about the total indiscriminate tariffs on more than China — that it gives cover to firms to jack up prices,” said Jen Harris, a former Biden White House official who is now director of the Economy and Society Initiative at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.  Advertisement  But what Trump didn’t really spell out is what might cause him to back down on tariffs and declare a victory. What he is creating instead with his tariff threats is a sense of uncertainty as companies and countries await the details to figure out what all of this could mean.  “We know the key economic policy priorities of the incoming Trump administration, but we don’t know how or when they will be addressed,” said Greg Daco, chief U.S. economist at EY-Parthenon.  __",US,0.511

The Commerce Department’s first estimate of economic growth in the July-September quarter, out Wednesday morning, found a 2.8% growth rate, a solid pace likely to keep unemployment down and wages rising.  Advertisement  On Tuesday, the Conference Board, a think tank, reported that its monthly consumer confidence measure jumped to 108.7 in October from 99.2 in September. That’s the biggest one-month change since March 2021, when the U.S. economy was still moving out of the slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Even gas prices have turned more favorable for the White House. The automotive organization AAA said the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.135 on Wednesday, and ranged as low as $2.897 to $2.687 in the Southern and central states.  The White House touted the statistics, the last major set of data that will be released ahead of the election aside from the October jobs report Friday.  Advertisement  “It wasn’t so long ago when commentators were certain that we would need a recession to beat inflation caused by the pandemic,” Lael Brainard, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters Wednesday. “But it’s now clear we’ve been able to bring inflation down to rates from before the pandemic while growing faster than projected. And that didn’t happen by accident.”  However, the reports, and Brainard’s assessment, stand in stark contrast with how voters perceive the economy. An Economist/YouGov survey found that 97% of respondents felt the economy was important and 38% of those polled felt the economy was in poor shape, compared to only 51% who felt it was fair or good.  But with the widely watched Dow Jones Industrial Average of stocks hitting record highs in recent weeks, the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates as insurance against a downturn, and price growth continuing to moderate, there are signs the economic mood may be lifting just in time to help Harris in her quest to succeed fellow Democrat Joe Biden as president.  Advertisement  The consumer confidence report data showed that expectations of the economy entering a recession fell in September, to their lowest levels since at least July 2022. Respondents’ expectations for their families’ financial situation six months from now were also the highest since then.  Brainard said the new estimate of economic growth, the first before revisions in November and December, brought the annual average rate of economic growth under Biden to 3.2%, the highest of any president since the turn of the century.  However, that hasn’t kept GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and his allies from talking about how inflation hit a four-decade high in 2022, and saying the economy had been artificially propped up.  Advertisement  Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, who has endorsed Trump, recently said federal debt has fueled the economy, and that budget cuts supported by Trump would cause “temporary hardship” for some people.  The next big economic report will be the monthly jobs tally released by the Labor Department on Friday morning. According to a survey of economists by Reuters, the projected growth in payrolls is only 90,000 jobs. That would be the lowest number in a while, as October saw a brief port strike as well as economic disruptions from Hurricane Helene in the Southeastern U.S.  Brainard downplayed expectations, calling the Labor release “a noisy report.”  “We anticipate that the payroll numbers will be lower as a result of those disruptions,” she said. “But nonetheless, we don’t anticipate that this will in any way affect the underlying trend. And the underlying trend, as you can see in several months of data, has been quite resilient.”",US,0.9632

Vice President Kamala Harris, who took Biden’s place as the Democratic presidential nominee, ultimately lost the election to her GOP opponent, President-elect Donald Trump. Carville argues that Biden’s initial wavering, and the Democrats’ subsequent electoral loss, turned an otherwise admirable run into a failure.  “The most tragic figure in American politics in my lifetime is President Biden,” Carville declared.  James Carville said that Joe Biden's tarnished legacy ""is fucking self-inflicted."" Left: Raul E.

Advertisement  “What’s so sad [is], it didn’t have to be this way,” Carville added. “He brought it all on himself.”  The strategist had predicted a clear-cut win for Harris but admitted after she lost that a lack of Democratic primaries had left the party without options.

Advertisement  Charlamagne, the outspoken “The Breakfast Club” radio show co-host, argued Wednesday on “The View” that the bipartisan condemnation of the pardon is “valid” because “Democrats stand on this moral high ground all the time” — and “act so self-righteous” about justice.  Joe Biden previously said he would not intervene in his son’s impending prosecutions. He also stated on social media following the guilty verdict of President-elect Donald Trump in his New York City criminal trial in May that “No one is above the law.”  “He could have said, ‘Hey man, I’m not focused on that right now,’ but since they were calling Trump a threat to democracy and they were saying nobody is above the law ... [they contradicted what] they were running on,” Charlamagne said Wednesday.  Advertisement  He continued, “So when he kept saying things like, ‘Ah, you know, nobody is above the law, I respect the jury’s decision in regards to my son,’ he didn’t believe that! But he didn’t have to volunteer that lie to begin with.”  That last line earned Charlamagne some temporary ire from Goldberg.  “I’m going to stop you for a second,” she said, and argued to the radio host, born Lenard McKelvey, that he doesn’t actually know if “it was a lie” or why the president reversed course regarding the pardon.  “You really think he just changed his mind over Thanksgiving weekend all of a sudden?” Charlamagne asked.  Advertisement  “I think he changed his mind because he got sick of watching everybody else get over,” said Goldberg. “At some point, you get to the place where you just go, ’So I’m just going to follow the straight and narrow, always, ‘cause that’s what’s expected of Democrats?’”  Charlamagne said the expectation in this case came from the president himself, however, and slammed the team-based mentality of partisan loyalists who “refuse to be objective” about their own party.  Goldberg, a Democrat, said in response, “Democrats are not a monolith.”  “Why can’t you say when Democrats are wrong?” Charlamagne replied. “And why can’t Republicans say when Republicans are wrong?”  Advertisement  Goldberg claimed she does hold the party accountable on the air and reiterated that she doesn’t think the pardon was a political mistake.  Charlamagne called her response “ridiculous,” which Goldberg misheard as an insult, prompting him to repeat his claim and make amends on air.  “I didn’t say you were ridiculous, Ms. Goldberg,” said Charlamagne before they hugged. “I would never.”",US,-0.9437

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads. Try and win an argument with any woman in Canada,” he said. “We’re pretty tough and resilient people.”",US,-0.7272

It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.  Advertisement  “Whether or not it’s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I’m saying is it’s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,” he added.  ___",US,0.9502

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

(AP Photo/Zurab Tsertsvadze) via Associated Press  Who is the outgoing president?  Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia’s opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.  The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.  ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us. He is controlled by a puppet government, by Bidzina Ivanishvili, by Putin,” protester Sandro Samkharadze said. Another protester waved a sign saying “We are children of Europe.”",US,0.9014

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

Advertisement  “You can’t just be the resistance,” he said. “Be the voice against crazy and injustice and unfairness. But go in there and find places that you can work with Republicans to get things done.”  Asked what advice he would give Democrats, Tony Fabrizio of Fabrizio Ward, President-elect Donald Trump’s chief pollster, said: “Stop being prisoners to your own special interests.  “They’re more worried about their base and honestly they went too far,” Fabrizio told a reporter roundtable organized by the AARP. (Fabrizio emphasized that he was speaking as a pollster for the interest group for older Americans and not for the Trump campaign.) “One of the reasons why the ad we did about the trans thing worked was the tagline: Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”  Advertisement  Fabrizio was referencing what was widely considered one of the most effective yet polarizing ads of the 2024 election, which seized on a clip in which Harris expressed support for taxpayer-funded transgender surgery for prison inmates. Anzalone and Fabrizio agreed the footage, from Harris’ 2019 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, was a gift to Republicans and Trump.  Democrats are still divided on why Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Getty Images  “We’ve gotten to a point in society where if you disagree with something like that, you’re the extremist, you’re out of the mainstream,” Fabrizio said. “And in my opinion Democrats, particularly Democrats in D.C., are very much captive of that political correctness that the rest of the country just doesn’t get. And actually it’s off-putting to the rest of the country.”  Advertisement  Both pollsters agreed the economy was the driving factor in this year’s election — and that Trump crafted a more compelling economic message to woo undecided voters.  “Watching every TV ad in every battleground state, I think [the Trump campaign] did a brilliant job of the economic narrative on the cost of living,” Anzalone said.  The party is divided on where Harris ultimately fell short on Election Day, resulting in the loss of every swing state and the national popular vote — a first for the party since 2004. Democrats including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont believe the party further abandoned a jilted working class, while others downplayed the overall degree of its losses.  Advertisement  Anzalone and Fabrizio also agreed that, despite an early surge following Harris’ replacement of President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, the Trump campaign did a better job defining Harris using mostly her own words.  “I think the sugar high never put into the equation the pushback that ... when she ran in 2019, she was the most liberal candidate of what, 17 candidates? That’s not a criticism, that’s just where she was. And those interviews came back,” Anzalone said.  And yet, Anzalone — Biden’s longtime pollster — said Democratic losses would have been far more devastating had Biden remained the nominee.  Advertisement  “I’m a Biden guy. I’ve been working for him since I was 22. I love the man,” he said. “But if Joe Biden was the nominee, I think we lose [Michigan Sen.-elect] Elissa Slotkin. I think we lose [Wisconsin Sen. Tammy] Baldwin. I think we lose [Nevada Sen. Jacky] Rosen. … I actually think we probably would have lost Arizona [in the U.S.] Senate.”  The political climate, however, can shift dramatically over the next two years, giving Democrats an opening.  “America is kind of pissed off right now,” Anzalone said. “Don’t think they’re joyous about Republicans. They were just a little less joyous about Democrats … this was still a lesser of two evils election.”",US,0.9652

There is no mechanism to deport U.S. citizens, regardless of their parent’s status.  When asked how mass deportation would impact America’s roughly 4 million mixed-status families, President-elect Donald Trump said, ""The only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back."" Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images  It also remains to be seen whether Trump’s bluster is just an off-the-cuff remark from someone with a hazy grasp of the details or will amount to actual policy. Tom Homan, who headed Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump in 2017 and has been tapped to serve as his “border czar,” made a similar claim in an interview with “60 Minutes” in October, then tried to walk back his comments in a later interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity.  Advertisement  But if Homan and Trump are serious about removing American citizen children along with their parents, they’ll face one major hurdle: ICE won’t have the authority to do so.  “This is blatantly illegal territory,” said Azadeh Erfani, policy director for the National Immigrant Justice Center. “They have no jurisdiction to deport U.S. citizens — children or adults.”  Instead, legal experts say that Trump and Homan are issuing threats to create a climate of fear while laying the groundwork for a campaign to pressure unauthorized immigrants to return to their home countries on their own, taking families that may include U.S. citizens with them.  Advertisement  “You cannot deport U.S. citizens,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. “However, when faced with the deportation of family members, families might make difficult choices about whether to leave the country with their relatives.”  In some ways, Trump’s comments simply reflect the reality of removal proceedings. Deportation has always put parents of American citizen children in the agonizing position of choosing between leaving their kids behind or bringing them to a country they had reason to leave.  “Even under current policies and practices, it’s not uncommon that U.S. citizen children are effectively deported when their parents are deported and there aren’t good options for their children,” Denise Gilman, a law professor who directs the University of Texas at Austin Immigration Clinic, told HuffPost. “We see that all the time.”  Advertisement  But while deportation has always threatened to either tear families apart or force American kids into removal along with a parent, having a president come to office promising to target families — especially ones with U.S.-born kids — puts the United States on a new course.  “Everybody is going to be really afraid,” Gilman said.  The Obama administration sharply blunted the impact of deportation on mixed-status families with the implementation of a prosecutorial discretion policy in 2011 that limited enforcement against unauthorized migrants in removal proceedings who did not have serious criminal records but did have significant ties to the United States, including U.S. citizen or permanent resident children, parents or spouses.    Deportations from the interior of the United States plummeted from a peak of 223,755 in 2010, Barack Obama’s second year in office, to 65,332 in his last year in 2016, largely due to prosecutorial discretion.  Advertisement  Trump scrapped his predecessor’s discretion policy in his first term, but President Joe Biden reimplemented it the day he took office. Trump is expected to do away with prosecutorial discretion once again next month.  With neither the resources nor the legal authority to remove U.S. citizens, ICE may explore other options. They may affix ankle monitors to unauthorized immigrants with American-born children and tell them to arrange to return to their home country on their own, according to David Leopold, a partner at UB Greensfelder’s immigration law practice.  “They’ll say, ‘Come back and show us you got a plane ticket’ — it’s easier and cheaper for ICE to do it that way,” Leopold told HuffPost. “For all intents and purposes, they were deported with their parents, but you have the legal fiction of them leaving voluntarily.”  Advertisement  Trump’s attacks on U.S.-born children are also laying the groundwork for his broadside against birthright citizenship, Leopold said — the constitutionally protected standard of recognizing those born within the United States as American citizens.",US,0.8175

Johnson, when asked how “complicated” it’d be for the president-elect to roll out the deportation plan, told host Kristen Welker that someone should pass a law banning executive orders on the first day of a new administration.  “Because the reality is executive orders drafted by transition teams without the input of the affected agency before the Cabinet secretary is even confirmed are not great ideas,” Johnson explained.  Advertisement  He then referred to Trump’s travel ban in 2017, a move that barred people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, before pointing fingers at himself.  “I was involved in the transition 16 years ago and Guantanamo Bay is still open,” noted Johnson of Obama issuing an executive order to close the facility in the early days of his first term.  He stressed the need for “enforcement priorities” in an administration regardless of who is president.  Advertisement  “Start with the criminals, start with the national security threats, recent border crossers. Tom Homan knows that. I know he knows that because he used to work for me,” said Johnson of Trump’s pick to be “border czar” in his second term.  He continued, “And I’d rather see ERO go after the criminals versus somebody who’s been in this country 12 years, committed no crimes, has children who are U.S. citizens. And that’s the reality of enforcement and that’s — I’m sure that will be the reality of enforcement even under a President Trump.”  Enforcement and Removal Operations, or ERO, is the division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) responsible for the arrest and removal of undocumented immigrants.  Advertisement  Moments later, Welker told the show’s panel that it could be a “little bit tougher” for Trump to tackle his agenda as Republicans control the House by a “very narrow margin.”  Stephen Hayes, editor of The Dispatch, said this could make it “somewhat tenuous” for Trump.  “But I think that argues in favor of Donald Trump being aggressive on executive actions,” he added.  “He said he ran on tariffs. He ran on mass deportations. We know that these are issues that he cares about viscerally in a way that he doesn’t care about some other issues viscerally. I expect him to go as far as he possibly can in those two areas.”",US,-0.7526

Do you have an actual plan at this point for health care?” Welker asked in reference to Trump’s vague claim during his debate with Kamala Harris.  Advertisement  “Yes, we have concepts of a plan that would be better,” Trump replied.  “Still just concepts? Do you have a fully developed plan?” asked the host of “Meet the Press.”  “We have the biggest health care companies looking at it. We have doctors who are always looking. Because Obamacare stinks, it’s lousy. There are better answers,” he said.  He continued: “If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I’d do something about it. But until we have that or until they can approve it — we’re not going to go through the big deal. I am the one that saved Obamacare, I will say, and I did the right thing.”  Trump, when asked if Americans will see his “fully developed” plan, said he doesn’t know if people will “see it at all.”  Advertisement  He told Welker that Americans with preexisting conditions will still have coverage under his “concepts of a plan” and declared that he wants “better health care for less money.”  The president-elect — who promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act during his 2016 campaign — has tried to rewrite history on his Obamacare record by claiming that he tried to “save” the law during his first term as president.  Earlier in the interview, Welker cited Republicans who told her it’s “no longer feasible” to repeal and replace Obamacare because it’s “so entrenched in the system.”  Advertisement  “Do you see it that way? Is that now off the table?” she asked.  In response, Trump slammed the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for his thumbs-down vote against repealing the ACA’s individual mandate. He went on to describe how he made it so Obamacare “works.”  “But you did try to overturn it, sir,” Welker noted.  “It’s lou — well, it’s lousy,” Trump said.  “You did try to overturn it.

The Monday decision partially reversed a 2023 preliminary injunction that blocked enforcement of the state’s abortion trafficking law on First Amendment grounds. Although some national abortion rights groups described the ruling as “devastating for young people in Idaho,” an attorney for the pro-choice plaintiffs in the case told HuffPost on Friday there was one major victory in the ongoing case.  Advertisement  The Monday decision is only a small part of a larger case surrounding the state’s so-called “abortion trafficking” law. Litigation is currently ongoing and the merits of the case have yet to be argued. The law is not currently in effect.  The law, signed last year by Gov. Brad Little (R), created a new felony called “abortion trafficking,” defined as when an “adult ... with the intent to conceal an abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant, unemancipated minor, either procures an abortion … or obtains an abortion-inducing drug” for that minor. “Abortion trafficking” also involves “recruiting, harboring, or transporting” a pregnant minor for an abortion, the law states. Violations are punishable by two to five years in prison.  The law’s sweeping language seeks to criminalize anyone transporting a pregnant minor without parental consent with the intent to get an abortion, or any adult offering counseling to a pregnant minor on the minor’s reproductive health options.  Advertisement  Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a vocal opponent of abortion, called the ruling a “tremendous victory” in a press release.  “Idaho’s laws were passed specifically to protect the life of the unborn and the life of the mother,” Labrador said. “Trafficking a minor child for an abortion without parental consent puts both in grave danger, and we will not stop protecting life in Idaho.”  The court’s ruling said that the state can enforce the “harboring” and “transporting” part of the law, but it cannot enforce the “recruiting” statute. The anti-abortion Republicans who wrote the law did not define “recruiting,” which the appeals court found to be “unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expressive speech.”  Advertisement  This part of the ruling was a “huge victory,” said Wendy Heipt, an attorney for the plaintiffs. It’s the first abortion case at the federal level to acknowledge a person’s right to freely discuss abortion even if obtaining care is illegal in a person’s home state.  “I can’t stress enough how important it is that the most vulnerable people in Idaho ― which are minors in situations that are unsafe or violent ― can now actually turn to trusted adults and learn what their options are,” Heipt told HuffPost.  Raul Labrador, Idaho's attorney general, speaks outside the US Supreme Court earlier this year. Labrador has advocated for an interstate abortion ban travel as well as banning health-stabilizing abortions for women in medical emergencies. Bloomberg via Getty Images  Advertisement  The panel of judges effectively said Idaho cannot criminalize people who are simply providing information about abortion, including educational counseling, encouragement or how to logistically or financially obtain abortion care. Idahoans are protected by free speech to talk to anyone, including minors, about abortion care ― even if abortion is largely illegal in the state, the court ruled.  The judges used a hypothetical situation in their ruling to portray how slippery the slope would be if the state could prosecute people for “recruiting” minors under this law:  “Imagine an Idaho resident who lives near the border of Oregon and displays a bumper sticker that reads: ‘Legal abortions are okay, and they’re right next door. Ask me about it!’ A minor sees the sticker and, feeling desperate, approaches the driver to request a ride across state lines. ‘I need an abortion,’ the minor says, ‘and my parents can’t know.’ The driver says: ‘I’m sorry, I can’t drive you there. But, here, take this cash. That should cover the procedure.’ The minor takes the cash, finds a ride to Oregon with another minor, and gets a legal abortion with the money the driver provided. Under Section 18-623, the driver might be prosecuted for ‘recruiting.’ The driver’s expression invited contact, causing the minor to approach and find out how to get a legal abortion. The bumper sticker, and perhaps the offer of cash, arguably persuaded or even induced the minor to have the abortion. The cash also paid for, or ‘procured,’ the abortion. Thus, the driver procured an abortion for the minor, in part by recruiting.”  The ruling on the “recruiting” provision sets some kind of legal standard for other states looking to pass similar laws. Tennessee passed a similar law this year that is currently blocked with a preliminary injunction, and Republicans in Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi introduced similar abortion trafficking laws in 2024 that failed. A New Hampshire Republican has already filed a similar abortion travel ban for the state’s upcoming legislative session.  The court’s decision on the recruitment statute also offers some legal basis for future attacks on pro-choice groups that provide abortion counseling or financial aid for abortion.  Advertisement  “Idahoans should be concerned and upset about what the legislators are doing and what the law still does ― absolutely,” Heipt said. “But they should be so relieved that they can still talk about and support abortion.”  Read the 9th Circuit’s decision below:  This article was updated throughout with quotes from Heipt to better reflect the impact of Monday’s ruling.",US,-0.1637

Of the 10 states where abortion rights were on the ballot on Tuesday, seven voted to expand or enshrine abortion rights. The results are emblematic of what pro-choice advocates have been saying for decades: Abortion rights are widely popular.  In the biggest win of the night, deep-red Missouri decided to codify abortion protections into the state constitution. The measure will repeal the state’s near-total abortion ban and restore access until around 24 weeks of pregnancy — marking the first time since Roe v. Wade fell that voters have overturned an abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest.  Advertisement  Voters in Maryland and Colorado supported amendments to enshrine abortion access throughout pregnancy — a progressive win in states that have become safe havens for abortion care later in pregnancy. Notably, Colorado’s amendment also repeals a 1984 state law that barred the use of public funds for abortion care.  Arizona, Montana and Nevada all voted to pass amendments that codify abortion through fetal viability, or around 24 weeks of pregnancy, into the state constitution.  New Yorkers passed a historic amendment to expand the state’s equal rights amendment to include pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. The amendment also includes protections against discrimination based on ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.  Advertisement  People at an election night watch party react after an abortion rights amendment in Missouri passed. AP Photo/Charlie Riedel  Three states — Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota — voted against abortion rights. A slim majority of Nebraska voters supported an anti-abortion amendment to codify the state’s current 12-week abortion ban, beating out the state’s competing abortion rights measure.  Florida’s outcome was particularly heartbreaking for pro-choice groups because a majority of Floridians (57%) supported the amendment, voting to restore abortion access until fetal viability. But because voters didn’t meet the state’s 60% threshold for amending the state constitution, Amendment 4 did not pass.  Advertisement  “The reality is because of Florida’s constitution a minority ― a minority ― a minority of Florida voters have decided that Amendment 4 will not be adopted,” Lauren Brenzel, director of the Yes On 4 campaign, said during her Tuesday night concession speech.  “Republicans, Democrats and Independents do not support these extreme bans on abortion. They are tired of women dying because of abortion bans,” she continued. “...A bipartisan group of voters today sent a clear message to the Florida legislature.”  Despite 7 out of 10 states voting to protect abortion care, voters still supported a presidential candidate who will very likely decimate women’s reproductive health care. Donald Trump may have shied away from his anti-abortion record on the campaign trail, but now that he’s headed to the White House, those guardrails will likely fall by the wayside.  Advertisement  Trump has waffled on a national abortion ban, but many of his allies laid out a blueprint for how to ban abortion nationwide in Project 2025.  A federal abortion ban would trump state rights, including the abortion rights measures that seven states passed last night, according to Mary Ziegler, an expert in reproductive health law at the University of California, Davis, School of Law. The Comstock Act, an archaic law that bans the mailing of abortion pills, would also likely supersede state rights if Trump enforces it as a national abortion ban.  Although the GOP won control of the Senate, control of the House — and with it, Trump’s ability to pass a national abortion ban through Congress — is still up in the air.  Advertisement  “Yet again, the people have spoken loudly and clearly: abortion is health care, and politicians do not deserve the right to make people’s medical decisions,” Pro-Choice Caucus co-chairs Reps. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said in Wednesday statement.  “In the months and years to come, there is no doubt we face a daunting path to securing reproductive freedom nationwide,” the statement continues. “We are clear-eyed about the threats ahead, from emboldened Republican extremists to a hostile White House and administration. We believe in a future of reproductive freedom for every American, and we will never stop fighting for you.”  There will be litigation in every state that passed an abortion rights amendment on Tuesday night. Opponents of the measures will likely bring legal challenges against the successful initiatives and fight to keep other abortion regulations in place, like waiting periods and mandatory counseling.",US,0.974

But their impact was barely noticeable in the overall economy, even if their aftershocks were clear in specific industries.  The data show they never fully delivered on his promised factory jobs. Nor did they provoke the avalanche of inflation that critics feared.  Advertisement  This time, though, his tariff threats might be different.  The president-elect is talking about going much bigger — on a potential scale that creates more uncertainty about whether he’ll do what he says and what the consequences could be.  “There’s going to be a lot more tariffs, I mean, he’s pretty clear,” said Michael Stumo, the CEO of Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that has supported import taxes to help domestic manufacturing.  The president-elect posted on social media Monday that on his first day in office he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada until those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States.  Advertisement  Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. But on Wednesday, Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States.  Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump listens during a campaign rally at Santander Arena, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Reading, Pa. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) via Associated Press  Trump also posted on Monday that Chinese imports would face additional tariffs of 10% until Beijing cracks down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl.  Advertisement  Democrats and business groups warn of risks from Trump’s tariff threats  Business groups were quick to warn about rapidly escalating inflation. House Democrats put together legislation to strip a president’s ability to unilaterally apply tariffs this drastic, warning that they would likely lead to higher prices for autos, shoes, housing and groceries.  Sheinbaum initially said Wednesday that her administration is already working up a list of possible retaliatory tariffs “if the situation comes to that.” Similarly, the Canadian government has also started to explore retaliatory tariffs if Trump takes action.  House Democrats on Tuesday introduced a bill that would require congressional approval for a president to impose tariffs due to claims of a national emergency, a largely symbolic action given Republicans’ coming control of both the House and Senate.  Advertisement  “This legislation would enable Congress to limit this sweeping emergency authority and put in place the necessary Congressional oversight before any president – Democrat or Republican – could indiscriminately raise costs on the American people through tariffs,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash.  Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, President of Mexico, speaks during a briefing conference about the rescue of Mexican Petroleum (PEMEX), at the National Palace. (Photo by Carlos Santiago/Eyepix Group/LightRocket via Getty Images) Eyepix Group via Getty Images  But for Trump, tariffs are now a tested tool that seems less politically controversial even if the mandate he received in November’s election largely involved restraining inflation.  Advertisement  The tariffs he imposed on China in his first term were continued by President Joe Biden, a Democrat who even expanded tariffs and restrictions on the world’s second largest economy. Biden administration officials looked at removing Trump’s tariffs in order to bring down inflationary pressures, only to find they were unlikely to help significantly.  Tariffs were “so new and unique that it freaked everybody out in 2017,” said Stumo, but they are now seen as part of the policy toolkit by the United States and other countries.  Trump’s first term tariffs had a modest impact on economy  Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines at the start of 2018, moves that might have pushed up prices in those sectors even though they also overlapped with plans to open washing machine plants in Tennessee and South Carolina.  Advertisement  His administration also levied tariffs on steel and aluminum, including against allies. He then increased tariffs on China, leading to a trade conflict and a limited 2020 agreement that failed to produce the promised Chinese purchases of U.S. goods.  Still, the dispute changed relations with China as more U.S. companies looked for alternative suppliers in other countries. Economic research also found the United States may have sacrificed some of its “soft power” as the Chinese population began to watch fewer American movies.  The Federal Reserve kept inflation roughly on target, but factory construction spending never jumped in a way that suggested a lasting gain in manufacturing jobs. Separate economic research found the tariff war with China did nothing economically for the communities hurt by offshoring, but it did help Trump and Republicans in those communities politically.  Advertisement  When Trump first became president in 2017, the federal government collected $34.6 billion in customs, duties and fees. That sum more than doubled under Trump to $70.8 billion in 2019, according to Office of Management and Budget records.  While that sum might seem meaningful, it was relatively small compared with the overall economy. America’s gross domestic product is now $29.3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The total tariffs collected in the United States would equal less than 0.3% of GDP.  Trump wants much more far-reaching tariffs going forward  The new tariffs being floated by Trump now are dramatically larger and there could be far more significant impacts.  Advertisement  If Mexico, Canada, and China faced the additional tariffs proposed by Trump on all goods imported to the United States, that could be roughly equal to $266 billion in tax collections, a number that does not assume any disruptions in trade or retaliatory moves by other countries. The cost of those taxes would likely be borne by U.S. families, importers and domestic and foreign companies in the form of higher prices or lower profits.  Former Biden administration officials said they worried that companies could piggyback on Trump’s tariffs — if they’re imposed — as a rationale to raise their prices. This would mirror price increases by many companies in 2022 that were made possible because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy prices and gave the companies cover to further raise their own prices.  “I’m very worried about the total indiscriminate tariffs on more than China — that it gives cover to firms to jack up prices,” said Jen Harris, a former Biden White House official who is now director of the Economy and Society Initiative at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.  Advertisement  But what Trump didn’t really spell out is what might cause him to back down on tariffs and declare a victory. What he is creating instead with his tariff threats is a sense of uncertainty as companies and countries await the details to figure out what all of this could mean.  “We know the key economic policy priorities of the incoming Trump administration, but we don’t know how or when they will be addressed,” said Greg Daco, chief U.S. economist at EY-Parthenon.  __",US,0.511

The Commerce Department’s first estimate of economic growth in the July-September quarter, out Wednesday morning, found a 2.8% growth rate, a solid pace likely to keep unemployment down and wages rising.  Advertisement  On Tuesday, the Conference Board, a think tank, reported that its monthly consumer confidence measure jumped to 108.7 in October from 99.2 in September. That’s the biggest one-month change since March 2021, when the U.S. economy was still moving out of the slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Even gas prices have turned more favorable for the White House. The automotive organization AAA said the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.135 on Wednesday, and ranged as low as $2.897 to $2.687 in the Southern and central states.  The White House touted the statistics, the last major set of data that will be released ahead of the election aside from the October jobs report Friday.  Advertisement  “It wasn’t so long ago when commentators were certain that we would need a recession to beat inflation caused by the pandemic,” Lael Brainard, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters Wednesday. “But it’s now clear we’ve been able to bring inflation down to rates from before the pandemic while growing faster than projected. And that didn’t happen by accident.”  However, the reports, and Brainard’s assessment, stand in stark contrast with how voters perceive the economy. An Economist/YouGov survey found that 97% of respondents felt the economy was important and 38% of those polled felt the economy was in poor shape, compared to only 51% who felt it was fair or good.  But with the widely watched Dow Jones Industrial Average of stocks hitting record highs in recent weeks, the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates as insurance against a downturn, and price growth continuing to moderate, there are signs the economic mood may be lifting just in time to help Harris in her quest to succeed fellow Democrat Joe Biden as president.  Advertisement  The consumer confidence report data showed that expectations of the economy entering a recession fell in September, to their lowest levels since at least July 2022. Respondents’ expectations for their families’ financial situation six months from now were also the highest since then.  Brainard said the new estimate of economic growth, the first before revisions in November and December, brought the annual average rate of economic growth under Biden to 3.2%, the highest of any president since the turn of the century.  However, that hasn’t kept GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and his allies from talking about how inflation hit a four-decade high in 2022, and saying the economy had been artificially propped up.  Advertisement  Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, who has endorsed Trump, recently said federal debt has fueled the economy, and that budget cuts supported by Trump would cause “temporary hardship” for some people.  The next big economic report will be the monthly jobs tally released by the Labor Department on Friday morning. According to a survey of economists by Reuters, the projected growth in payrolls is only 90,000 jobs. That would be the lowest number in a while, as October saw a brief port strike as well as economic disruptions from Hurricane Helene in the Southeastern U.S.  Brainard downplayed expectations, calling the Labor release “a noisy report.”  “We anticipate that the payroll numbers will be lower as a result of those disruptions,” she said. “But nonetheless, we don’t anticipate that this will in any way affect the underlying trend. And the underlying trend, as you can see in several months of data, has been quite resilient.”",US,0.9632

Vice President Kamala Harris, who took Biden’s place as the Democratic presidential nominee, ultimately lost the election to her GOP opponent, President-elect Donald Trump. Carville argues that Biden’s initial wavering, and the Democrats’ subsequent electoral loss, turned an otherwise admirable run into a failure.  “The most tragic figure in American politics in my lifetime is President Biden,” Carville declared.  James Carville said that Joe Biden's tarnished legacy ""is fucking self-inflicted."" Left: Raul E. Diego/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images; Right: Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press  Advertisement  Addressing Biden’s reversal on pardoning his own son, Carville seemed relatively unbothered. “So he said, ‘I’ll never pardon the kid,’ OK … everybody’s going to do whatever they’re gonna do with their own children,” he reasoned.  “But ... if he would have in September of 2023 or August said that he wasn’t going to run, goddamn we would have won this election,” Carville argued. “And it wouldn’t have been that close because we would’ve had so many talented frickin’ people that were running.”  The longtime Democratic strategist said that Biden could have left the White House “on a high note” as “the toast of Washington” with landmarks named after him, and that a future Democratic president could’ve pardoned Hunter Biden.  Advertisement  “What’s so sad [is], it didn’t have to be this way,” Carville added. “He brought it all on himself.”  The strategist had predicted a clear-cut win for Harris but admitted after she lost that a lack of Democratic primaries had left the party without options. Carville reiterated Thursday that he deeply respects Biden, which made the election outcome all the more devastating, he said.",US,-0.7011

Advertisement  Charlamagne, the outspoken “The Breakfast Club” radio show co-host, argued Wednesday on “The View” that the bipartisan condemnation of the pardon is “valid” because “Democrats stand on this moral high ground all the time” — and “act so self-righteous” about justice.  Joe Biden previously said he would not intervene in his son’s impending prosecutions. He also stated on social media following the guilty verdict of President-elect Donald Trump in his New York City criminal trial in May that “No one is above the law.”  “He could have said, ‘Hey man, I’m not focused on that right now,’ but since they were calling Trump a threat to democracy and they were saying nobody is above the law ... [they contradicted what] they were running on,” Charlamagne said Wednesday.  Advertisement  He continued, “So when he kept saying things like, ‘Ah, you know, nobody is above the law, I respect the jury’s decision in regards to my son,’ he didn’t believe that! But he didn’t have to volunteer that lie to begin with.”  That last line earned Charlamagne some temporary ire from Goldberg.  “I’m going to stop you for a second,” she said, and argued to the radio host, born Lenard McKelvey, that he doesn’t actually know if “it was a lie” or why the president reversed course regarding the pardon.  “You really think he just changed his mind over Thanksgiving weekend all of a sudden?” Charlamagne asked.  Advertisement  “I think he changed his mind because he got sick of watching everybody else get over,” said Goldberg. “At some point, you get to the place where you just go, ’So I’m just going to follow the straight and narrow, always, ‘cause that’s what’s expected of Democrats?’”  Charlamagne said the expectation in this case came from the president himself, however, and slammed the team-based mentality of partisan loyalists who “refuse to be objective” about their own party.  Goldberg, a Democrat, said in response, “Democrats are not a monolith.”  “Why can’t you say when Democrats are wrong?” Charlamagne replied. “And why can’t Republicans say when Republicans are wrong?”  Advertisement  Goldberg claimed she does hold the party accountable on the air and reiterated that she doesn’t think the pardon was a political mistake.  Charlamagne called her response “ridiculous,” which Goldberg misheard as an insult, prompting him to repeat his claim and make amends on air.  “I didn’t say you were ridiculous, Ms. Goldberg,” said Charlamagne before they hugged. “I would never.”",US,-0.9437

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads. Try and win an argument with any woman in Canada,” he said. “We’re pretty tough and resilient people.”",US,-0.7272

(AP) — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.  Advertisement  This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what’s behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  More drone sightings have been reported in New York City, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials. And then President-elect Donald Trump posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  This photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. (Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.  Advertisement  “Whether or not it’s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I’m saying is it’s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,” he added.  ___",US,0.9502

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

(AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia’s opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.  The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.  ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

Advertisement  “You can’t just be the resistance,” he said. “Be the voice against crazy and injustice and unfairness. But go in there and find places that you can work with Republicans to get things done.”  Asked what advice he would give Democrats, Tony Fabrizio of Fabrizio Ward, President-elect Donald Trump’s chief pollster, said: “Stop being prisoners to your own special interests.  “They’re more worried about their base and honestly they went too far,” Fabrizio told a reporter roundtable organized by the AARP. (Fabrizio emphasized that he was speaking as a pollster for the interest group for older Americans and not for the Trump campaign.) “One of the reasons why the ad we did about the trans thing worked was the tagline: Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”  Advertisement  Fabrizio was referencing what was widely considered one of the most effective yet polarizing ads of the 2024 election, which seized on a clip in which Harris expressed support for taxpayer-funded transgender surgery for prison inmates. Anzalone and Fabrizio agreed the footage, from Harris’ 2019 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, was a gift to Republicans and Trump.  Democrats are still divided on why Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Getty Images  “We’ve gotten to a point in society where if you disagree with something like that, you’re the extremist, you’re out of the mainstream,” Fabrizio said. “And in my opinion Democrats, particularly Democrats in D.C., are very much captive of that political correctness that the rest of the country just doesn’t get. And actually it’s off-putting to the rest of the country.”  Advertisement  Both pollsters agreed the economy was the driving factor in this year’s election — and that Trump crafted a more compelling economic message to woo undecided voters.  “Watching every TV ad in every battleground state, I think [the Trump campaign] did a brilliant job of the economic narrative on the cost of living,” Anzalone said.  The party is divided on where Harris ultimately fell short on Election Day, resulting in the loss of every swing state and the national popular vote — a first for the party since 2004. Democrats including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont believe the party further abandoned a jilted working class, while others downplayed the overall degree of its losses.  Advertisement  Anzalone and Fabrizio also agreed that, despite an early surge following Harris’ replacement of President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, the Trump campaign did a better job defining Harris using mostly her own words.  “I think the sugar high never put into the equation the pushback that ... when she ran in 2019, she was the most liberal candidate of what, 17 candidates? That’s not a criticism, that’s just where she was. And those interviews came back,” Anzalone said.  And yet, Anzalone — Biden’s longtime pollster — said Democratic losses would have been far more devastating had Biden remained the nominee.  Advertisement  “I’m a Biden guy. I’ve been working for him since I was 22. I love the man,” he said. “But if Joe Biden was the nominee, I think we lose [Michigan Sen.-elect] Elissa Slotkin. I think we lose [Wisconsin Sen. Tammy] Baldwin. I think we lose [Nevada Sen. Jacky] Rosen. … I actually think we probably would have lost Arizona [in the U.S.] Senate.”  The political climate, however, can shift dramatically over the next two years, giving Democrats an opening.  “America is kind of pissed off right now,” Anzalone said. “Don’t think they’re joyous about Republicans. They were just a little less joyous about Democrats … this was still a lesser of two evils election.”",US,0.9652

There is no mechanism to deport U.S. citizens, regardless of their parent’s status.  When asked how mass deportation would impact America’s roughly 4 million mixed-status families, President-elect Donald Trump said, ""The only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back."" Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images  It also remains to be seen whether Trump’s bluster is just an off-the-cuff remark from someone with a hazy grasp of the details or will amount to actual policy. Tom Homan, who headed Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump in 2017 and has been tapped to serve as his “border czar,” made a similar claim in an interview with “60 Minutes” in October, then tried to walk back his comments in a later interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity.  Advertisement  But if Homan and Trump are serious about removing American citizen children along with their parents, they’ll face one major hurdle: ICE won’t have the authority to do so.  “This is blatantly illegal territory,” said Azadeh Erfani, policy director for the National Immigrant Justice Center. “They have no jurisdiction to deport U.S. citizens — children or adults.”  Instead, legal experts say that Trump and Homan are issuing threats to create a climate of fear while laying the groundwork for a campaign to pressure unauthorized immigrants to return to their home countries on their own, taking families that may include U.S. citizens with them.  Advertisement  “You cannot deport U.S. citizens,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. “However, when faced with the deportation of family members, families might make difficult choices about whether to leave the country with their relatives.”  In some ways, Trump’s comments simply reflect the reality of removal proceedings. Deportation has always put parents of American citizen children in the agonizing position of choosing between leaving their kids behind or bringing them to a country they had reason to leave.  “Even under current policies and practices, it’s not uncommon that U.S. citizen children are effectively deported when their parents are deported and there aren’t good options for their children,” Denise Gilman, a law professor who directs the University of Texas at Austin Immigration Clinic, told HuffPost. “We see that all the time.”  Advertisement  But while deportation has always threatened to either tear families apart or force American kids into removal along with a parent, having a president come to office promising to target families — especially ones with U.S.-born kids — puts the United States on a new course.  “Everybody is going to be really afraid,” Gilman said.  The Obama administration sharply blunted the impact of deportation on mixed-status families with the implementation of a prosecutorial discretion policy in 2011 that limited enforcement against unauthorized migrants in removal proceedings who did not have serious criminal records but did have significant ties to the United States, including U.S. citizen or permanent resident children, parents or spouses.    Deportations from the interior of the United States plummeted from a peak of 223,755 in 2010, Barack Obama’s second year in office, to 65,332 in his last year in 2016, largely due to prosecutorial discretion.  Advertisement  Trump scrapped his predecessor’s discretion policy in his first term, but President Joe Biden reimplemented it the day he took office. Trump is expected to do away with prosecutorial discretion once again next month.  With neither the resources nor the legal authority to remove U.S. citizens, ICE may explore other options. They may affix ankle monitors to unauthorized immigrants with American-born children and tell them to arrange to return to their home country on their own, according to David Leopold, a partner at UB Greensfelder’s immigration law practice.  “They’ll say, ‘Come back and show us you got a plane ticket’ — it’s easier and cheaper for ICE to do it that way,” Leopold told HuffPost. “For all intents and purposes, they were deported with their parents, but you have the legal fiction of them leaving voluntarily.”  Advertisement  Trump’s attacks on U.S.-born children are also laying the groundwork for his broadside against birthright citizenship, Leopold said — the constitutionally protected standard of recognizing those born within the United States as American citizens.",US,0.8175

Johnson, when asked how “complicated” it’d be for the president-elect to roll out the deportation plan, told host Kristen Welker that someone should pass a law banning executive orders on the first day of a new administration.  “Because the reality is executive orders drafted by transition teams without the input of the affected agency before the Cabinet secretary is even confirmed are not great ideas,” Johnson explained.  Advertisement  He then referred to Trump’s travel ban in 2017, a move that barred people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, before pointing fingers at himself.  “I was involved in the transition 16 years ago and Guantanamo Bay is still open,” noted Johnson of Obama issuing an executive order to close the facility in the early days of his first term.  He stressed the need for “enforcement priorities” in an administration regardless of who is president.  Advertisement  “Start with the criminals, start with the national security threats, recent border crossers. Tom Homan knows that. I know he knows that because he used to work for me,” said Johnson of Trump’s pick to be “border czar” in his second term.  He continued, “And I’d rather see ERO go after the criminals versus somebody who’s been in this country 12 years, committed no crimes, has children who are U.S. citizens. And that’s the reality of enforcement and that’s — I’m sure that will be the reality of enforcement even under a President Trump.”  Enforcement and Removal Operations, or ERO, is the division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) responsible for the arrest and removal of undocumented immigrants.  Advertisement  Moments later, Welker told the show’s panel that it could be a “little bit tougher” for Trump to tackle his agenda as Republicans control the House by a “very narrow margin.”  Stephen Hayes, editor of The Dispatch, said this could make it “somewhat tenuous” for Trump.  “But I think that argues in favor of Donald Trump being aggressive on executive actions,” he added.  “He said he ran on tariffs. He ran on mass deportations. We know that these are issues that he cares about viscerally in a way that he doesn’t care about some other issues viscerally.

The Monday decision partially reversed a 2023 preliminary injunction that blocked enforcement of the state’s abortion trafficking law on First Amendment grounds. Although some national abortion rights groups described the ruling as “devastating for young people in Idaho,” an attorney for the pro-choice plaintiffs in the case told HuffPost on Friday there was one major victory in the ongoing case.  Advertisement  The Monday decision is only a small part of a larger case surrounding the state’s so-called “abortion trafficking” law. Litigation is currently ongoing and the merits of the case have yet to be argued. The law is not currently in effect.  The law, signed last year by Gov. Brad Little (R), created a new felony called “abortion trafficking,” defined as when an “adult ... with the intent to conceal an abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant, unemancipated minor, either procures an abortion … or obtains an abortion-inducing drug” for that minor. “Abortion trafficking” also involves “recruiting, harboring, or transporting” a pregnant minor for an abortion, the law states. Violations are punishable by two to five years in prison.  The law’s sweeping language seeks to criminalize anyone transporting a pregnant minor without parental consent with the intent to get an abortion, or any adult offering counseling to a pregnant minor on the minor’s reproductive health options.  Advertisement  Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a vocal opponent of abortion, called the ruling a “tremendous victory” in a press release.  “Idaho’s laws were passed specifically to protect the life of the unborn and the life of the mother,” Labrador said. “Trafficking a minor child for an abortion without parental consent puts both in grave danger, and we will not stop protecting life in Idaho.”  The court’s ruling said that the state can enforce the “harboring” and “transporting” part of the law, but it cannot enforce the “recruiting” statute. The anti-abortion Republicans who wrote the law did not define “recruiting,” which the appeals court found to be “unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expressive speech.”  Advertisement  This part of the ruling was a “huge victory,” said Wendy Heipt, an attorney for the plaintiffs. It’s the first abortion case at the federal level to acknowledge a person’s right to freely discuss abortion even if obtaining care is illegal in a person’s home state.  “I can’t stress enough how important it is that the most vulnerable people in Idaho ― which are minors in situations that are unsafe or violent ― can now actually turn to trusted adults and learn what their options are,” Heipt told HuffPost.  Raul Labrador, Idaho's attorney general, speaks outside the US Supreme Court earlier this year. Labrador has advocated for an interstate abortion ban travel as well as banning health-stabilizing abortions for women in medical emergencies. Bloomberg via Getty Images  Advertisement  The panel of judges effectively said Idaho cannot criminalize people who are simply providing information about abortion, including educational counseling, encouragement or how to logistically or financially obtain abortion care. Idahoans are protected by free speech to talk to anyone, including minors, about abortion care ― even if abortion is largely illegal in the state, the court ruled.  The judges used a hypothetical situation in their ruling to portray how slippery the slope would be if the state could prosecute people for “recruiting” minors under this law:  “Imagine an Idaho resident who lives near the border of Oregon and displays a bumper sticker that reads: ‘Legal abortions are okay, and they’re right next door. Ask me about it!’ A minor sees the sticker and, feeling desperate, approaches the driver to request a ride across state lines. ‘I need an abortion,’ the minor says, ‘and my parents can’t know.’ The driver says: ‘I’m sorry, I can’t drive you there. But, here, take this cash. That should cover the procedure.’ The minor takes the cash, finds a ride to Oregon with another minor, and gets a legal abortion with the money the driver provided. Under Section 18-623, the driver might be prosecuted for ‘recruiting.’ The driver’s expression invited contact, causing the minor to approach and find out how to get a legal abortion. The bumper sticker, and perhaps the offer of cash, arguably persuaded or even induced the minor to have the abortion. The cash also paid for, or ‘procured,’ the abortion. Thus, the driver procured an abortion for the minor, in part by recruiting.”  The ruling on the “recruiting” provision sets some kind of legal standard for other states looking to pass similar laws. Tennessee passed a similar law this year that is currently blocked with a preliminary injunction, and Republicans in Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi introduced similar abortion trafficking laws in 2024 that failed. A New Hampshire Republican has already filed a similar abortion travel ban for the state’s upcoming legislative session.  The court’s decision on the recruitment statute also offers some legal basis for future attacks on pro-choice groups that provide abortion counseling or financial aid for abortion.

Of the 10 states where abortion rights were on the ballot on Tuesday, seven voted to expand or enshrine abortion rights. The results are emblematic of what pro-choice advocates have been saying for decades: Abortion rights are widely popular.  In the biggest win of the night, deep-red Missouri decided to codify abortion protections into the state constitution. The measure will repeal the state’s near-total abortion ban and restore access until around 24 weeks of pregnancy — marking the first time since Roe v. Wade fell that voters have overturned an abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest.  Advertisement  Voters in Maryland and Colorado supported amendments to enshrine abortion access throughout pregnancy — a progressive win in states that have become safe havens for abortion care later in pregnancy. Notably, Colorado’s amendment also repeals a 1984 state law that barred the use of public funds for abortion care.  Arizona, Montana and Nevada all voted to pass amendments that codify abortion through fetal viability, or around 24 weeks of pregnancy, into the state constitution.  New Yorkers passed a historic amendment to expand the state’s equal rights amendment to include pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. The amendment also includes protections against discrimination based on ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.  Advertisement  People at an election night watch party react after an abortion rights amendment in Missouri passed. AP Photo/Charlie Riedel  Three states — Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota — voted against abortion rights. A slim majority of Nebraska voters supported an anti-abortion amendment to codify the state’s current 12-week abortion ban, beating out the state’s competing abortion rights measure.  Florida’s outcome was particularly heartbreaking for pro-choice groups because a majority of Floridians (57%) supported the amendment, voting to restore abortion access until fetal viability. But because voters didn’t meet the state’s 60% threshold for amending the state constitution, Amendment 4 did not pass.  Advertisement  “The reality is because of Florida’s constitution a minority ― a minority ― a minority of Florida voters have decided that Amendment 4 will not be adopted,” Lauren Brenzel, director of the Yes On 4 campaign, said during her Tuesday night concession speech.  “Republicans, Democrats and Independents do not support these extreme bans on abortion. They are tired of women dying because of abortion bans,” she continued. “...A bipartisan group of voters today sent a clear message to the Florida legislature.”  Despite 7 out of 10 states voting to protect abortion care, voters still supported a presidential candidate who will very likely decimate women’s reproductive health care. Donald Trump may have shied away from his anti-abortion record on the campaign trail, but now that he’s headed to the White House, those guardrails will likely fall by the wayside.  Advertisement  Trump has waffled on a national abortion ban, but many of his allies laid out a blueprint for how to ban abortion nationwide in Project 2025.  A federal abortion ban would trump state rights, including the abortion rights measures that seven states passed last night, according to Mary Ziegler, an expert in reproductive health law at the University of California, Davis, School of Law. The Comstock Act, an archaic law that bans the mailing of abortion pills, would also likely supersede state rights if Trump enforces it as a national abortion ban.  Although the GOP won control of the Senate, control of the House — and with it, Trump’s ability to pass a national abortion ban through Congress — is still up in the air.  Advertisement  “Yet again, the people have spoken loudly and clearly: abortion is health care, and politicians do not deserve the right to make people’s medical decisions,” Pro-Choice Caucus co-chairs Reps. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said in Wednesday statement.  “In the months and years to come, there is no doubt we face a daunting path to securing reproductive freedom nationwide,” the statement continues. “We are clear-eyed about the threats ahead, from emboldened Republican extremists to a hostile White House and administration. We believe in a future of reproductive freedom for every American, and we will never stop fighting for you.”  There will be litigation in every state that passed an abortion rights amendment on Tuesday night. Opponents of the measures will likely bring legal challenges against the successful initiatives and fight to keep other abortion regulations in place, like waiting periods and mandatory counseling.",US,0.974

But their impact was barely noticeable in the overall economy, even if their aftershocks were clear in specific industries.  The data show they never fully delivered on his promised factory jobs. Nor did they provoke the avalanche of inflation that critics feared.  Advertisement  This time, though, his tariff threats might be different.  The president-elect is talking about going much bigger — on a potential scale that creates more uncertainty about whether he’ll do what he says and what the consequences could be.  “There’s going to be a lot more tariffs, I mean, he’s pretty clear,” said Michael Stumo, the CEO of Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that has supported import taxes to help domestic manufacturing.  The president-elect posted on social media Monday that on his first day in office he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada until those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States.  Advertisement  Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. But on Wednesday, Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States.  Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump listens during a campaign rally at Santander Arena, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Reading, Pa. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) via Associated Press  Trump also posted on Monday that Chinese imports would face additional tariffs of 10% until Beijing cracks down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl.  Advertisement  Democrats and business groups warn of risks from Trump’s tariff threats  Business groups were quick to warn about rapidly escalating inflation. House Democrats put together legislation to strip a president’s ability to unilaterally apply tariffs this drastic, warning that they would likely lead to higher prices for autos, shoes, housing and groceries.  Sheinbaum initially said Wednesday that her administration is already working up a list of possible retaliatory tariffs “if the situation comes to that.” Similarly, the Canadian government has also started to explore retaliatory tariffs if Trump takes action.  House Democrats on Tuesday introduced a bill that would require congressional approval for a president to impose tariffs due to claims of a national emergency, a largely symbolic action given Republicans’ coming control of both the House and Senate.  Advertisement  “This legislation would enable Congress to limit this sweeping emergency authority and put in place the necessary Congressional oversight before any president – Democrat or Republican – could indiscriminately raise costs on the American people through tariffs,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash.  Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, President of Mexico, speaks during a briefing conference about the rescue of Mexican Petroleum (PEMEX), at the National Palace.

Advertisement  The tariffs he imposed on China in his first term were continued by President Joe Biden, a Democrat who even expanded tariffs and restrictions on the world’s second largest economy. Biden administration officials looked at removing Trump’s tariffs in order to bring down inflationary pressures, only to find they were unlikely to help significantly.  Tariffs were “so new and unique that it freaked everybody out in 2017,” said Stumo, but they are now seen as part of the policy toolkit by the United States and other countries.  Trump’s first term tariffs had a modest impact on economy  Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines at the start of 2018, moves that might have pushed up prices in those sectors even though they also overlapped with plans to open washing machine plants in Tennessee and South Carolina.  Advertisement  His administration also levied tariffs on steel and aluminum, including against allies. He then increased tariffs on China, leading to a trade conflict and a limited 2020 agreement that failed to produce the promised Chinese purchases of U.S. goods.  Still, the dispute changed relations with China as more U.S. companies looked for alternative suppliers in other countries. Economic research also found the United States may have sacrificed some of its “soft power” as the Chinese population began to watch fewer American movies.  The Federal Reserve kept inflation roughly on target, but factory construction spending never jumped in a way that suggested a lasting gain in manufacturing jobs. Separate economic research found the tariff war with China did nothing economically for the communities hurt by offshoring, but it did help Trump and Republicans in those communities politically.  Advertisement  When Trump first became president in 2017, the federal government collected $34.6 billion in customs, duties and fees. That sum more than doubled under Trump to $70.8 billion in 2019, according to Office of Management and Budget records.  While that sum might seem meaningful, it was relatively small compared with the overall economy. America’s gross domestic product is now $29.3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The total tariffs collected in the United States would equal less than 0.3% of GDP.  Trump wants much more far-reaching tariffs going forward  The new tariffs being floated by Trump now are dramatically larger and there could be far more significant impacts.  Advertisement  If Mexico, Canada, and China faced the additional tariffs proposed by Trump on all goods imported to the United States, that could be roughly equal to $266 billion in tax collections, a number that does not assume any disruptions in trade or retaliatory moves by other countries. The cost of those taxes would likely be borne by U.S. families, importers and domestic and foreign companies in the form of higher prices or lower profits.  Former Biden administration officials said they worried that companies could piggyback on Trump’s tariffs — if they’re imposed — as a rationale to raise their prices. This would mirror price increases by many companies in 2022 that were made possible because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy prices and gave the companies cover to further raise their own prices.  “I’m very worried about the total indiscriminate tariffs on more than China — that it gives cover to firms to jack up prices,” said Jen Harris, a former Biden White House official who is now director of the Economy and Society Initiative at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.  Advertisement  But what Trump didn’t really spell out is what might cause him to back down on tariffs and declare a victory. What he is creating instead with his tariff threats is a sense of uncertainty as companies and countries await the details to figure out what all of this could mean.  “We know the key economic policy priorities of the incoming Trump administration, but we don’t know how or when they will be addressed,” said Greg Daco, chief U.S. economist at EY-Parthenon.  __",US,0.511

The Commerce Department’s first estimate of economic growth in the July-September quarter, out Wednesday morning, found a 2.8% growth rate, a solid pace likely to keep unemployment down and wages rising.  Advertisement  On Tuesday, the Conference Board, a think tank, reported that its monthly consumer confidence measure jumped to 108.7 in October from 99.2 in September. That’s the biggest one-month change since March 2021, when the U.S. economy was still moving out of the slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Even gas prices have turned more favorable for the White House. The automotive organization AAA said the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.135 on Wednesday, and ranged as low as $2.897 to $2.687 in the Southern and central states.  The White House touted the statistics, the last major set of data that will be released ahead of the election aside from the October jobs report Friday.  Advertisement  “It wasn’t so long ago when commentators were certain that we would need a recession to beat inflation caused by the pandemic,” Lael Brainard, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters Wednesday. “But it’s now clear we’ve been able to bring inflation down to rates from before the pandemic while growing faster than projected. And that didn’t happen by accident.”  However, the reports, and Brainard’s assessment, stand in stark contrast with how voters perceive the economy. An Economist/YouGov survey found that 97% of respondents felt the economy was important and 38% of those polled felt the economy was in poor shape, compared to only 51% who felt it was fair or good.  But with the widely watched Dow Jones Industrial Average of stocks hitting record highs in recent weeks, the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates as insurance against a downturn, and price growth continuing to moderate, there are signs the economic mood may be lifting just in time to help Harris in her quest to succeed fellow Democrat Joe Biden as president.  Advertisement  The consumer confidence report data showed that expectations of the economy entering a recession fell in September, to their lowest levels since at least July 2022. Respondents’ expectations for their families’ financial situation six months from now were also the highest since then.  Brainard said the new estimate of economic growth, the first before revisions in November and December, brought the annual average rate of economic growth under Biden to 3.2%, the highest of any president since the turn of the century.  However, that hasn’t kept GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and his allies from talking about how inflation hit a four-decade high in 2022, and saying the economy had been artificially propped up.  Advertisement  Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, who has endorsed Trump, recently said federal debt has fueled the economy, and that budget cuts supported by Trump would cause “temporary hardship” for some people.  The next big economic report will be the monthly jobs tally released by the Labor Department on Friday morning. According to a survey of economists by Reuters, the projected growth in payrolls is only 90,000 jobs. That would be the lowest number in a while, as October saw a brief port strike as well as economic disruptions from Hurricane Helene in the Southeastern U.S.  Brainard downplayed expectations, calling the Labor release “a noisy report.”  “We anticipate that the payroll numbers will be lower as a result of those disruptions,” she said. “But nonetheless, we don’t anticipate that this will in any way affect the underlying trend. And the underlying trend, as you can see in several months of data, has been quite resilient.”",US,0.9632

Vice President Kamala Harris, who took Biden’s place as the Democratic presidential nominee, ultimately lost the election to her GOP opponent, President-elect Donald Trump. Carville argues that Biden’s initial wavering, and the Democrats’ subsequent electoral loss, turned an otherwise admirable run into a failure.  “The most tragic figure in American politics in my lifetime is President Biden,” Carville declared.  James Carville said that Joe Biden's tarnished legacy ""is fucking self-inflicted."" Left: Raul E.

Advertisement  “What’s so sad [is], it didn’t have to be this way,” Carville added. “He brought it all on himself.”  The strategist had predicted a clear-cut win for Harris but admitted after she lost that a lack of Democratic primaries had left the party without options.

Advertisement  Charlamagne, the outspoken “The Breakfast Club” radio show co-host, argued Wednesday on “The View” that the bipartisan condemnation of the pardon is “valid” because “Democrats stand on this moral high ground all the time” — and “act so self-righteous” about justice.  Joe Biden previously said he would not intervene in his son’s impending prosecutions. He also stated on social media following the guilty verdict of President-elect Donald Trump in his New York City criminal trial in May that “No one is above the law.”  “He could have said, ‘Hey man, I’m not focused on that right now,’ but since they were calling Trump a threat to democracy and they were saying nobody is above the law ... [they contradicted what] they were running on,” Charlamagne said Wednesday.  Advertisement  He continued, “So when he kept saying things like, ‘Ah, you know, nobody is above the law, I respect the jury’s decision in regards to my son,’ he didn’t believe that! But he didn’t have to volunteer that lie to begin with.”  That last line earned Charlamagne some temporary ire from Goldberg.  “I’m going to stop you for a second,” she said, and argued to the radio host, born Lenard McKelvey, that he doesn’t actually know if “it was a lie” or why the president reversed course regarding the pardon.  “You really think he just changed his mind over Thanksgiving weekend all of a sudden?” Charlamagne asked.  Advertisement  “I think he changed his mind because he got sick of watching everybody else get over,” said Goldberg. “At some point, you get to the place where you just go, ’So I’m just going to follow the straight and narrow, always, ‘cause that’s what’s expected of Democrats?’”  Charlamagne said the expectation in this case came from the president himself, however, and slammed the team-based mentality of partisan loyalists who “refuse to be objective” about their own party.  Goldberg, a Democrat, said in response, “Democrats are not a monolith.”  “Why can’t you say when Democrats are wrong?” Charlamagne replied. “And why can’t Republicans say when Republicans are wrong?”  Advertisement  Goldberg claimed she does hold the party accountable on the air and reiterated that she doesn’t think the pardon was a political mistake.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads. Try and win an argument with any woman in Canada,” he said. “We’re pretty tough and resilient people.”",US,-0.7272

(AP) — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.  Advertisement  This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what’s behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  More drone sightings have been reported in New York City, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials. And then President-elect Donald Trump posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  This photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. (Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.  Advertisement  “Whether or not it’s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I’m saying is it’s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,” he added.  ___",US,0.9502

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia’s opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.  The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.  ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

Advertisement  “You can’t just be the resistance,” he said. “Be the voice against crazy and injustice and unfairness. But go in there and find places that you can work with Republicans to get things done.”  Asked what advice he would give Democrats, Tony Fabrizio of Fabrizio Ward, President-elect Donald Trump’s chief pollster, said: “Stop being prisoners to your own special interests.  “They’re more worried about their base and honestly they went too far,” Fabrizio told a reporter roundtable organized by the AARP. (Fabrizio emphasized that he was speaking as a pollster for the interest group for older Americans and not for the Trump campaign.) “One of the reasons why the ad we did about the trans thing worked was the tagline: Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”  Advertisement  Fabrizio was referencing what was widely considered one of the most effective yet polarizing ads of the 2024 election, which seized on a clip in which Harris expressed support for taxpayer-funded transgender surgery for prison inmates. Anzalone and Fabrizio agreed the footage, from Harris’ 2019 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, was a gift to Republicans and Trump.  Democrats are still divided on why Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Getty Images  “We’ve gotten to a point in society where if you disagree with something like that, you’re the extremist, you’re out of the mainstream,” Fabrizio said. “And in my opinion Democrats, particularly Democrats in D.C., are very much captive of that political correctness that the rest of the country just doesn’t get. And actually it’s off-putting to the rest of the country.”  Advertisement  Both pollsters agreed the economy was the driving factor in this year’s election — and that Trump crafted a more compelling economic message to woo undecided voters.  “Watching every TV ad in every battleground state, I think [the Trump campaign] did a brilliant job of the economic narrative on the cost of living,” Anzalone said.  The party is divided on where Harris ultimately fell short on Election Day, resulting in the loss of every swing state and the national popular vote — a first for the party since 2004. Democrats including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont believe the party further abandoned a jilted working class, while others downplayed the overall degree of its losses.  Advertisement  Anzalone and Fabrizio also agreed that, despite an early surge following Harris’ replacement of President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, the Trump campaign did a better job defining Harris using mostly her own words.  “I think the sugar high never put into the equation the pushback that ... when she ran in 2019, she was the most liberal candidate of what, 17 candidates? That’s not a criticism, that’s just where she was. And those interviews came back,” Anzalone said.  And yet, Anzalone — Biden’s longtime pollster — said Democratic losses would have been far more devastating had Biden remained the nominee.  Advertisement  “I’m a Biden guy. I’ve been working for him since I was 22. I love the man,” he said. “But if Joe Biden was the nominee, I think we lose [Michigan Sen.-elect] Elissa Slotkin. I think we lose [Wisconsin Sen. Tammy] Baldwin. I think we lose [Nevada Sen. Jacky] Rosen. … I actually think we probably would have lost Arizona [in the U.S.] Senate.”  The political climate, however, can shift dramatically over the next two years, giving Democrats an opening.  “America is kind of pissed off right now,” Anzalone said. “Don’t think they’re joyous about Republicans. They were just a little less joyous about Democrats … this was still a lesser of two evils election.”",US,0.9652

There is no mechanism to deport U.S. citizens, regardless of their parent’s status.  When asked how mass deportation would impact America’s roughly 4 million mixed-status families, President-elect Donald Trump said, ""The only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back."" Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images  It also remains to be seen whether Trump’s bluster is just an off-the-cuff remark from someone with a hazy grasp of the details or will amount to actual policy. Tom Homan, who headed Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump in 2017 and has been tapped to serve as his “border czar,” made a similar claim in an interview with “60 Minutes” in October, then tried to walk back his comments in a later interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity.  Advertisement  But if Homan and Trump are serious about removing American citizen children along with their parents, they’ll face one major hurdle: ICE won’t have the authority to do so.  “This is blatantly illegal territory,” said Azadeh Erfani, policy director for the National Immigrant Justice Center. “They have no jurisdiction to deport U.S. citizens — children or adults.”  Instead, legal experts say that Trump and Homan are issuing threats to create a climate of fear while laying the groundwork for a campaign to pressure unauthorized immigrants to return to their home countries on their own, taking families that may include U.S. citizens with them.  Advertisement  “You cannot deport U.S. citizens,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. “However, when faced with the deportation of family members, families might make difficult choices about whether to leave the country with their relatives.”  In some ways, Trump’s comments simply reflect the reality of removal proceedings. Deportation has always put parents of American citizen children in the agonizing position of choosing between leaving their kids behind or bringing them to a country they had reason to leave.  “Even under current policies and practices, it’s not uncommon that U.S. citizen children are effectively deported when their parents are deported and there aren’t good options for their children,” Denise Gilman, a law professor who directs the University of Texas at Austin Immigration Clinic, told HuffPost. “We see that all the time.”  Advertisement  But while deportation has always threatened to either tear families apart or force American kids into removal along with a parent, having a president come to office promising to target families — especially ones with U.S.-born kids — puts the United States on a new course.  “Everybody is going to be really afraid,” Gilman said.  The Obama administration sharply blunted the impact of deportation on mixed-status families with the implementation of a prosecutorial discretion policy in 2011 that limited enforcement against unauthorized migrants in removal proceedings who did not have serious criminal records but did have significant ties to the United States, including U.S. citizen or permanent resident children, parents or spouses.    Deportations from the interior of the United States plummeted from a peak of 223,755 in 2010, Barack Obama’s second year in office, to 65,332 in his last year in 2016, largely due to prosecutorial discretion.  Advertisement  Trump scrapped his predecessor’s discretion policy in his first term, but President Joe Biden reimplemented it the day he took office. Trump is expected to do away with prosecutorial discretion once again next month.  With neither the resources nor the legal authority to remove U.S. citizens, ICE may explore other options. They may affix ankle monitors to unauthorized immigrants with American-born children and tell them to arrange to return to their home country on their own, according to David Leopold, a partner at UB Greensfelder’s immigration law practice.  “They’ll say, ‘Come back and show us you got a plane ticket’ — it’s easier and cheaper for ICE to do it that way,” Leopold told HuffPost. “For all intents and purposes, they were deported with their parents, but you have the legal fiction of them leaving voluntarily.”  Advertisement  Trump’s attacks on U.S.-born children are also laying the groundwork for his broadside against birthright citizenship, Leopold said — the constitutionally protected standard of recognizing those born within the United States as American citizens.",US,0.8175

Johnson, when asked how “complicated” it’d be for the president-elect to roll out the deportation plan, told host Kristen Welker that someone should pass a law banning executive orders on the first day of a new administration.  “Because the reality is executive orders drafted by transition teams without the input of the affected agency before the Cabinet secretary is even confirmed are not great ideas,” Johnson explained.  Advertisement  He then referred to Trump’s travel ban in 2017, a move that barred people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, before pointing fingers at himself.  “I was involved in the transition 16 years ago and Guantanamo Bay is still open,” noted Johnson of Obama issuing an executive order to close the facility in the early days of his first term.  He stressed the need for “enforcement priorities” in an administration regardless of who is president.  Advertisement  “Start with the criminals, start with the national security threats, recent border crossers. Tom Homan knows that. I know he knows that because he used to work for me,” said Johnson of Trump’s pick to be “border czar” in his second term.  He continued, “And I’d rather see ERO go after the criminals versus somebody who’s been in this country 12 years, committed no crimes, has children who are U.S. citizens. And that’s the reality of enforcement and that’s — I’m sure that will be the reality of enforcement even under a President Trump.”  Enforcement and Removal Operations, or ERO, is the division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) responsible for the arrest and removal of undocumented immigrants.  Advertisement  Moments later, Welker told the show’s panel that it could be a “little bit tougher” for Trump to tackle his agenda as Republicans control the House by a “very narrow margin.”  Stephen Hayes, editor of The Dispatch, said this could make it “somewhat tenuous” for Trump.  “But I think that argues in favor of Donald Trump being aggressive on executive actions,” he added.  “He said he ran on tariffs. He ran on mass deportations. We know that these are issues that he cares about viscerally in a way that he doesn’t care about some other issues viscerally.

Do you have an actual plan at this point for health care?” Welker asked in reference to Trump’s vague claim during his debate with Kamala Harris.  Advertisement  “Yes, we have concepts of a plan that would be better,” Trump replied.  “Still just concepts?

The Monday decision partially reversed a 2023 preliminary injunction that blocked enforcement of the state’s abortion trafficking law on First Amendment grounds. Although some national abortion rights groups described the ruling as “devastating for young people in Idaho,” an attorney for the pro-choice plaintiffs in the case told HuffPost on Friday there was one major victory in the ongoing case.  Advertisement  The Monday decision is only a small part of a larger case surrounding the state’s so-called “abortion trafficking” law. Litigation is currently ongoing and the merits of the case have yet to be argued. The law is not currently in effect.  The law, signed last year by Gov. Brad Little (R), created a new felony called “abortion trafficking,” defined as when an “adult ... with the intent to conceal an abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant, unemancipated minor, either procures an abortion … or obtains an abortion-inducing drug” for that minor. “Abortion trafficking” also involves “recruiting, harboring, or transporting” a pregnant minor for an abortion, the law states. Violations are punishable by two to five years in prison.  The law’s sweeping language seeks to criminalize anyone transporting a pregnant minor without parental consent with the intent to get an abortion, or any adult offering counseling to a pregnant minor on the minor’s reproductive health options.  Advertisement  Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a vocal opponent of abortion, called the ruling a “tremendous victory” in a press release.  “Idaho’s laws were passed specifically to protect the life of the unborn and the life of the mother,” Labrador said. “Trafficking a minor child for an abortion without parental consent puts both in grave danger, and we will not stop protecting life in Idaho.”  The court’s ruling said that the state can enforce the “harboring” and “transporting” part of the law, but it cannot enforce the “recruiting” statute. The anti-abortion Republicans who wrote the law did not define “recruiting,” which the appeals court found to be “unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expressive speech.”  Advertisement  This part of the ruling was a “huge victory,” said Wendy Heipt, an attorney for the plaintiffs. It’s the first abortion case at the federal level to acknowledge a person’s right to freely discuss abortion even if obtaining care is illegal in a person’s home state.  “I can’t stress enough how important it is that the most vulnerable people in Idaho ― which are minors in situations that are unsafe or violent ― can now actually turn to trusted adults and learn what their options are,” Heipt told HuffPost.  Raul Labrador, Idaho's attorney general, speaks outside the US Supreme Court earlier this year. Labrador has advocated for an interstate abortion ban travel as well as banning health-stabilizing abortions for women in medical emergencies. Bloomberg via Getty Images  Advertisement  The panel of judges effectively said Idaho cannot criminalize people who are simply providing information about abortion, including educational counseling, encouragement or how to logistically or financially obtain abortion care. Idahoans are protected by free speech to talk to anyone, including minors, about abortion care ― even if abortion is largely illegal in the state, the court ruled.  The judges used a hypothetical situation in their ruling to portray how slippery the slope would be if the state could prosecute people for “recruiting” minors under this law:  “Imagine an Idaho resident who lives near the border of Oregon and displays a bumper sticker that reads: ‘Legal abortions are okay, and they’re right next door. Ask me about it!’ A minor sees the sticker and, feeling desperate, approaches the driver to request a ride across state lines. ‘I need an abortion,’ the minor says, ‘and my parents can’t know.’ The driver says: ‘I’m sorry, I can’t drive you there. But, here, take this cash. That should cover the procedure.’ The minor takes the cash, finds a ride to Oregon with another minor, and gets a legal abortion with the money the driver provided. Under Section 18-623, the driver might be prosecuted for ‘recruiting.’ The driver’s expression invited contact, causing the minor to approach and find out how to get a legal abortion. The bumper sticker, and perhaps the offer of cash, arguably persuaded or even induced the minor to have the abortion. The cash also paid for, or ‘procured,’ the abortion. Thus, the driver procured an abortion for the minor, in part by recruiting.”  The ruling on the “recruiting” provision sets some kind of legal standard for other states looking to pass similar laws. Tennessee passed a similar law this year that is currently blocked with a preliminary injunction, and Republicans in Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi introduced similar abortion trafficking laws in 2024 that failed. A New Hampshire Republican has already filed a similar abortion travel ban for the state’s upcoming legislative session.  The court’s decision on the recruitment statute also offers some legal basis for future attacks on pro-choice groups that provide abortion counseling or financial aid for abortion.  Advertisement  “Idahoans should be concerned and upset about what the legislators are doing and what the law still does ― absolutely,” Heipt said. “But they should be so relieved that they can still talk about and support abortion.”  Read the 9th Circuit’s decision below:  This article was updated throughout with quotes from Heipt to better reflect the impact of Monday’s ruling.",US,-0.1637

Of the 10 states where abortion rights were on the ballot on Tuesday, seven voted to expand or enshrine abortion rights. The results are emblematic of what pro-choice advocates have been saying for decades: Abortion rights are widely popular.  In the biggest win of the night, deep-red Missouri decided to codify abortion protections into the state constitution. The measure will repeal the state’s near-total abortion ban and restore access until around 24 weeks of pregnancy — marking the first time since Roe v. Wade fell that voters have overturned an abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest.  Advertisement  Voters in Maryland and Colorado supported amendments to enshrine abortion access throughout pregnancy — a progressive win in states that have become safe havens for abortion care later in pregnancy. Notably, Colorado’s amendment also repeals a 1984 state law that barred the use of public funds for abortion care.  Arizona, Montana and Nevada all voted to pass amendments that codify abortion through fetal viability, or around 24 weeks of pregnancy, into the state constitution.  New Yorkers passed a historic amendment to expand the state’s equal rights amendment to include pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. The amendment also includes protections against discrimination based on ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.  Advertisement  People at an election night watch party react after an abortion rights amendment in Missouri passed. AP Photo/Charlie Riedel  Three states — Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota — voted against abortion rights. A slim majority of Nebraska voters supported an anti-abortion amendment to codify the state’s current 12-week abortion ban, beating out the state’s competing abortion rights measure.  Florida’s outcome was particularly heartbreaking for pro-choice groups because a majority of Floridians (57%) supported the amendment, voting to restore abortion access until fetal viability. But because voters didn’t meet the state’s 60% threshold for amending the state constitution, Amendment 4 did not pass.  Advertisement  “The reality is because of Florida’s constitution a minority ― a minority ― a minority of Florida voters have decided that Amendment 4 will not be adopted,” Lauren Brenzel, director of the Yes On 4 campaign, said during her Tuesday night concession speech.  “Republicans, Democrats and Independents do not support these extreme bans on abortion. They are tired of women dying because of abortion bans,” she continued. “...A bipartisan group of voters today sent a clear message to the Florida legislature.”  Despite 7 out of 10 states voting to protect abortion care, voters still supported a presidential candidate who will very likely decimate women’s reproductive health care. Donald Trump may have shied away from his anti-abortion record on the campaign trail, but now that he’s headed to the White House, those guardrails will likely fall by the wayside.  Advertisement  Trump has waffled on a national abortion ban, but many of his allies laid out a blueprint for how to ban abortion nationwide in Project 2025.  A federal abortion ban would trump state rights, including the abortion rights measures that seven states passed last night, according to Mary Ziegler, an expert in reproductive health law at the University of California, Davis, School of Law. The Comstock Act, an archaic law that bans the mailing of abortion pills, would also likely supersede state rights if Trump enforces it as a national abortion ban.  Although the GOP won control of the Senate, control of the House — and with it, Trump’s ability to pass a national abortion ban through Congress — is still up in the air.  Advertisement  “Yet again, the people have spoken loudly and clearly: abortion is health care, and politicians do not deserve the right to make people’s medical decisions,” Pro-Choice Caucus co-chairs Reps. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said in Wednesday statement.  “In the months and years to come, there is no doubt we face a daunting path to securing reproductive freedom nationwide,” the statement continues. “We are clear-eyed about the threats ahead, from emboldened Republican extremists to a hostile White House and administration. We believe in a future of reproductive freedom for every American, and we will never stop fighting for you.”  There will be litigation in every state that passed an abortion rights amendment on Tuesday night. Opponents of the measures will likely bring legal challenges against the successful initiatives and fight to keep other abortion regulations in place, like waiting periods and mandatory counseling.",US,0.974

But their impact was barely noticeable in the overall economy, even if their aftershocks were clear in specific industries.  The data show they never fully delivered on his promised factory jobs. Nor did they provoke the avalanche of inflation that critics feared.  Advertisement  This time, though, his tariff threats might be different.  The president-elect is talking about going much bigger — on a potential scale that creates more uncertainty about whether he’ll do what he says and what the consequences could be.  “There’s going to be a lot more tariffs, I mean, he’s pretty clear,” said Michael Stumo, the CEO of Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that has supported import taxes to help domestic manufacturing.  The president-elect posted on social media Monday that on his first day in office he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada until those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States.  Advertisement  Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. But on Wednesday, Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States.  Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump listens during a campaign rally at Santander Arena, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Reading, Pa. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) via Associated Press  Trump also posted on Monday that Chinese imports would face additional tariffs of 10% until Beijing cracks down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl.  Advertisement  Democrats and business groups warn of risks from Trump’s tariff threats  Business groups were quick to warn about rapidly escalating inflation. House Democrats put together legislation to strip a president’s ability to unilaterally apply tariffs this drastic, warning that they would likely lead to higher prices for autos, shoes, housing and groceries.  Sheinbaum initially said Wednesday that her administration is already working up a list of possible retaliatory tariffs “if the situation comes to that.” Similarly, the Canadian government has also started to explore retaliatory tariffs if Trump takes action.  House Democrats on Tuesday introduced a bill that would require congressional approval for a president to impose tariffs due to claims of a national emergency, a largely symbolic action given Republicans’ coming control of both the House and Senate.  Advertisement  “This legislation would enable Congress to limit this sweeping emergency authority and put in place the necessary Congressional oversight before any president – Democrat or Republican – could indiscriminately raise costs on the American people through tariffs,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash.  Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, President of Mexico, speaks during a briefing conference about the rescue of Mexican Petroleum (PEMEX), at the National Palace.

Advertisement  The tariffs he imposed on China in his first term were continued by President Joe Biden, a Democrat who even expanded tariffs and restrictions on the world’s second largest economy. Biden administration officials looked at removing Trump’s tariffs in order to bring down inflationary pressures, only to find they were unlikely to help significantly.  Tariffs were “so new and unique that it freaked everybody out in 2017,” said Stumo, but they are now seen as part of the policy toolkit by the United States and other countries.  Trump’s first term tariffs had a modest impact on economy  Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines at the start of 2018, moves that might have pushed up prices in those sectors even though they also overlapped with plans to open washing machine plants in Tennessee and South Carolina.  Advertisement  His administration also levied tariffs on steel and aluminum, including against allies. He then increased tariffs on China, leading to a trade conflict and a limited 2020 agreement that failed to produce the promised Chinese purchases of U.S. goods.  Still, the dispute changed relations with China as more U.S. companies looked for alternative suppliers in other countries. Economic research also found the United States may have sacrificed some of its “soft power” as the Chinese population began to watch fewer American movies.  The Federal Reserve kept inflation roughly on target, but factory construction spending never jumped in a way that suggested a lasting gain in manufacturing jobs. Separate economic research found the tariff war with China did nothing economically for the communities hurt by offshoring, but it did help Trump and Republicans in those communities politically.  Advertisement  When Trump first became president in 2017, the federal government collected $34.6 billion in customs, duties and fees. That sum more than doubled under Trump to $70.8 billion in 2019, according to Office of Management and Budget records.  While that sum might seem meaningful, it was relatively small compared with the overall economy. America’s gross domestic product is now $29.3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The total tariffs collected in the United States would equal less than 0.3% of GDP.  Trump wants much more far-reaching tariffs going forward  The new tariffs being floated by Trump now are dramatically larger and there could be far more significant impacts.  Advertisement  If Mexico, Canada, and China faced the additional tariffs proposed by Trump on all goods imported to the United States, that could be roughly equal to $266 billion in tax collections, a number that does not assume any disruptions in trade or retaliatory moves by other countries. The cost of those taxes would likely be borne by U.S. families, importers and domestic and foreign companies in the form of higher prices or lower profits.  Former Biden administration officials said they worried that companies could piggyback on Trump’s tariffs — if they’re imposed — as a rationale to raise their prices. This would mirror price increases by many companies in 2022 that were made possible because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy prices and gave the companies cover to further raise their own prices.  “I’m very worried about the total indiscriminate tariffs on more than China — that it gives cover to firms to jack up prices,” said Jen Harris, a former Biden White House official who is now director of the Economy and Society Initiative at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.  Advertisement  But what Trump didn’t really spell out is what might cause him to back down on tariffs and declare a victory. What he is creating instead with his tariff threats is a sense of uncertainty as companies and countries await the details to figure out what all of this could mean.  “We know the key economic policy priorities of the incoming Trump administration, but we don’t know how or when they will be addressed,” said Greg Daco, chief U.S. economist at EY-Parthenon.  __",US,0.511

The Commerce Department’s first estimate of economic growth in the July-September quarter, out Wednesday morning, found a 2.8% growth rate, a solid pace likely to keep unemployment down and wages rising.  Advertisement  On Tuesday, the Conference Board, a think tank, reported that its monthly consumer confidence measure jumped to 108.7 in October from 99.2 in September. That’s the biggest one-month change since March 2021, when the U.S. economy was still moving out of the slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Even gas prices have turned more favorable for the White House. The automotive organization AAA said the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.135 on Wednesday, and ranged as low as $2.897 to $2.687 in the Southern and central states.  The White House touted the statistics, the last major set of data that will be released ahead of the election aside from the October jobs report Friday.  Advertisement  “It wasn’t so long ago when commentators were certain that we would need a recession to beat inflation caused by the pandemic,” Lael Brainard, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters Wednesday. “But it’s now clear we’ve been able to bring inflation down to rates from before the pandemic while growing faster than projected. And that didn’t happen by accident.”  However, the reports, and Brainard’s assessment, stand in stark contrast with how voters perceive the economy. An Economist/YouGov survey found that 97% of respondents felt the economy was important and 38% of those polled felt the economy was in poor shape, compared to only 51% who felt it was fair or good.  But with the widely watched Dow Jones Industrial Average of stocks hitting record highs in recent weeks, the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates as insurance against a downturn, and price growth continuing to moderate, there are signs the economic mood may be lifting just in time to help Harris in her quest to succeed fellow Democrat Joe Biden as president.  Advertisement  The consumer confidence report data showed that expectations of the economy entering a recession fell in September, to their lowest levels since at least July 2022. Respondents’ expectations for their families’ financial situation six months from now were also the highest since then.  Brainard said the new estimate of economic growth, the first before revisions in November and December, brought the annual average rate of economic growth under Biden to 3.2%, the highest of any president since the turn of the century.  However, that hasn’t kept GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and his allies from talking about how inflation hit a four-decade high in 2022, and saying the economy had been artificially propped up.  Advertisement  Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, who has endorsed Trump, recently said federal debt has fueled the economy, and that budget cuts supported by Trump would cause “temporary hardship” for some people.  The next big economic report will be the monthly jobs tally released by the Labor Department on Friday morning. According to a survey of economists by Reuters, the projected growth in payrolls is only 90,000 jobs. That would be the lowest number in a while, as October saw a brief port strike as well as economic disruptions from Hurricane Helene in the Southeastern U.S.  Brainard downplayed expectations, calling the Labor release “a noisy report.”  “We anticipate that the payroll numbers will be lower as a result of those disruptions,” she said. “But nonetheless, we don’t anticipate that this will in any way affect the underlying trend. And the underlying trend, as you can see in several months of data, has been quite resilient.”",US,0.9632

Vice President Kamala Harris, who took Biden’s place as the Democratic presidential nominee, ultimately lost the election to her GOP opponent, President-elect Donald Trump. Carville argues that Biden’s initial wavering, and the Democrats’ subsequent electoral loss, turned an otherwise admirable run into a failure.  “The most tragic figure in American politics in my lifetime is President Biden,” Carville declared.  James Carville said that Joe Biden's tarnished legacy ""is fucking self-inflicted."" Left: Raul E.

Advertisement  “What’s so sad [is], it didn’t have to be this way,” Carville added. “He brought it all on himself.”  The strategist had predicted a clear-cut win for Harris but admitted after she lost that a lack of Democratic primaries had left the party without options.

Advertisement  Charlamagne, the outspoken “The Breakfast Club” radio show co-host, argued Wednesday on “The View” that the bipartisan condemnation of the pardon is “valid” because “Democrats stand on this moral high ground all the time” — and “act so self-righteous” about justice.  Joe Biden previously said he would not intervene in his son’s impending prosecutions. He also stated on social media following the guilty verdict of President-elect Donald Trump in his New York City criminal trial in May that “No one is above the law.”  “He could have said, ‘Hey man, I’m not focused on that right now,’ but since they were calling Trump a threat to democracy and they were saying nobody is above the law ... [they contradicted what] they were running on,” Charlamagne said Wednesday.  Advertisement  He continued, “So when he kept saying things like, ‘Ah, you know, nobody is above the law, I respect the jury’s decision in regards to my son,’ he didn’t believe that! But he didn’t have to volunteer that lie to begin with.”  That last line earned Charlamagne some temporary ire from Goldberg.  “I’m going to stop you for a second,” she said, and argued to the radio host, born Lenard McKelvey, that he doesn’t actually know if “it was a lie” or why the president reversed course regarding the pardon.  “You really think he just changed his mind over Thanksgiving weekend all of a sudden?” Charlamagne asked.  Advertisement  “I think he changed his mind because he got sick of watching everybody else get over,” said Goldberg. “At some point, you get to the place where you just go, ’So I’m just going to follow the straight and narrow, always, ‘cause that’s what’s expected of Democrats?’”  Charlamagne said the expectation in this case came from the president himself, however, and slammed the team-based mentality of partisan loyalists who “refuse to be objective” about their own party.  Goldberg, a Democrat, said in response, “Democrats are not a monolith.”  “Why can’t you say when Democrats are wrong?” Charlamagne replied. “And why can’t Republicans say when Republicans are wrong?”  Advertisement  Goldberg claimed she does hold the party accountable on the air and reiterated that she doesn’t think the pardon was a political mistake.  Charlamagne called her response “ridiculous,” which Goldberg misheard as an insult, prompting him to repeat his claim and make amends on air.  “I didn’t say you were ridiculous, Ms. Goldberg,” said Charlamagne before they hugged. “I would never.”",US,-0.9437

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads. Try and win an argument with any woman in Canada,” he said. “We’re pretty tough and resilient people.”",US,-0.7272

(AP) — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.  Advertisement  This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what’s behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.

This photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. (Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.  Advertisement  “Whether or not it’s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I’m saying is it’s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,” he added.  ___",US,0.9502

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

(AP Photo/Zurab Tsertsvadze) via Associated Press  Who is the outgoing president?  Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia’s opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.  The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.  ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us. He is controlled by a puppet government, by Bidzina Ivanishvili, by Putin,” protester Sandro Samkharadze said. Another protester waved a sign saying “We are children of Europe.”",US,0.9014

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

Advertisement  “You can’t just be the resistance,” he said. “Be the voice against crazy and injustice and unfairness. But go in there and find places that you can work with Republicans to get things done.”  Asked what advice he would give Democrats, Tony Fabrizio of Fabrizio Ward, President-elect Donald Trump’s chief pollster, said: “Stop being prisoners to your own special interests.  “They’re more worried about their base and honestly they went too far,” Fabrizio told a reporter roundtable organized by the AARP. (Fabrizio emphasized that he was speaking as a pollster for the interest group for older Americans and not for the Trump campaign.) “One of the reasons why the ad we did about the trans thing worked was the tagline: Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”  Advertisement  Fabrizio was referencing what was widely considered one of the most effective yet polarizing ads of the 2024 election, which seized on a clip in which Harris expressed support for taxpayer-funded transgender surgery for prison inmates. Anzalone and Fabrizio agreed the footage, from Harris’ 2019 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, was a gift to Republicans and Trump.  Democrats are still divided on why Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Getty Images  “We’ve gotten to a point in society where if you disagree with something like that, you’re the extremist, you’re out of the mainstream,” Fabrizio said. “And in my opinion Democrats, particularly Democrats in D.C., are very much captive of that political correctness that the rest of the country just doesn’t get. And actually it’s off-putting to the rest of the country.”  Advertisement  Both pollsters agreed the economy was the driving factor in this year’s election — and that Trump crafted a more compelling economic message to woo undecided voters.  “Watching every TV ad in every battleground state, I think [the Trump campaign] did a brilliant job of the economic narrative on the cost of living,” Anzalone said.  The party is divided on where Harris ultimately fell short on Election Day, resulting in the loss of every swing state and the national popular vote — a first for the party since 2004. Democrats including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont believe the party further abandoned a jilted working class, while others downplayed the overall degree of its losses.  Advertisement  Anzalone and Fabrizio also agreed that, despite an early surge following Harris’ replacement of President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, the Trump campaign did a better job defining Harris using mostly her own words.  “I think the sugar high never put into the equation the pushback that ... when she ran in 2019, she was the most liberal candidate of what, 17 candidates? That’s not a criticism, that’s just where she was. And those interviews came back,” Anzalone said.  And yet, Anzalone — Biden’s longtime pollster — said Democratic losses would have been far more devastating had Biden remained the nominee.  Advertisement  “I’m a Biden guy. I’ve been working for him since I was 22. I love the man,” he said. “But if Joe Biden was the nominee, I think we lose [Michigan Sen.-elect] Elissa Slotkin. I think we lose [Wisconsin Sen. Tammy] Baldwin. I think we lose [Nevada Sen. Jacky] Rosen. … I actually think we probably would have lost Arizona [in the U.S.] Senate.”  The political climate, however, can shift dramatically over the next two years, giving Democrats an opening.  “America is kind of pissed off right now,” Anzalone said. “Don’t think they’re joyous about Republicans. They were just a little less joyous about Democrats … this was still a lesser of two evils election.”",US,0.9652

There is no mechanism to deport U.S. citizens, regardless of their parent’s status.  When asked how mass deportation would impact America’s roughly 4 million mixed-status families, President-elect Donald Trump said, ""The only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back."" Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images  It also remains to be seen whether Trump’s bluster is just an off-the-cuff remark from someone with a hazy grasp of the details or will amount to actual policy. Tom Homan, who headed Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump in 2017 and has been tapped to serve as his “border czar,” made a similar claim in an interview with “60 Minutes” in October, then tried to walk back his comments in a later interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity.  Advertisement  But if Homan and Trump are serious about removing American citizen children along with their parents, they’ll face one major hurdle: ICE won’t have the authority to do so.  “This is blatantly illegal territory,” said Azadeh Erfani, policy director for the National Immigrant Justice Center. “They have no jurisdiction to deport U.S. citizens — children or adults.”  Instead, legal experts say that Trump and Homan are issuing threats to create a climate of fear while laying the groundwork for a campaign to pressure unauthorized immigrants to return to their home countries on their own, taking families that may include U.S. citizens with them.  Advertisement  “You cannot deport U.S. citizens,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. “However, when faced with the deportation of family members, families might make difficult choices about whether to leave the country with their relatives.”  In some ways, Trump’s comments simply reflect the reality of removal proceedings. Deportation has always put parents of American citizen children in the agonizing position of choosing between leaving their kids behind or bringing them to a country they had reason to leave.  “Even under current policies and practices, it’s not uncommon that U.S. citizen children are effectively deported when their parents are deported and there aren’t good options for their children,” Denise Gilman, a law professor who directs the University of Texas at Austin Immigration Clinic, told HuffPost. “We see that all the time.”  Advertisement  But while deportation has always threatened to either tear families apart or force American kids into removal along with a parent, having a president come to office promising to target families — especially ones with U.S.-born kids — puts the United States on a new course.  “Everybody is going to be really afraid,” Gilman said.  The Obama administration sharply blunted the impact of deportation on mixed-status families with the implementation of a prosecutorial discretion policy in 2011 that limited enforcement against unauthorized migrants in removal proceedings who did not have serious criminal records but did have significant ties to the United States, including U.S. citizen or permanent resident children, parents or spouses.    Deportations from the interior of the United States plummeted from a peak of 223,755 in 2010, Barack Obama’s second year in office, to 65,332 in his last year in 2016, largely due to prosecutorial discretion.  Advertisement  Trump scrapped his predecessor’s discretion policy in his first term, but President Joe Biden reimplemented it the day he took office. Trump is expected to do away with prosecutorial discretion once again next month.  With neither the resources nor the legal authority to remove U.S. citizens, ICE may explore other options. They may affix ankle monitors to unauthorized immigrants with American-born children and tell them to arrange to return to their home country on their own, according to David Leopold, a partner at UB Greensfelder’s immigration law practice.  “They’ll say, ‘Come back and show us you got a plane ticket’ — it’s easier and cheaper for ICE to do it that way,” Leopold told HuffPost. “For all intents and purposes, they were deported with their parents, but you have the legal fiction of them leaving voluntarily.”  Advertisement  Trump’s attacks on U.S.-born children are also laying the groundwork for his broadside against birthright citizenship, Leopold said — the constitutionally protected standard of recognizing those born within the United States as American citizens.",US,0.8175

Johnson, when asked how “complicated” it’d be for the president-elect to roll out the deportation plan, told host Kristen Welker that someone should pass a law banning executive orders on the first day of a new administration.  “Because the reality is executive orders drafted by transition teams without the input of the affected agency before the Cabinet secretary is even confirmed are not great ideas,” Johnson explained.  Advertisement  He then referred to Trump’s travel ban in 2017, a move that barred people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, before pointing fingers at himself.  “I was involved in the transition 16 years ago and Guantanamo Bay is still open,” noted Johnson of Obama issuing an executive order to close the facility in the early days of his first term.  He stressed the need for “enforcement priorities” in an administration regardless of who is president.  Advertisement  “Start with the criminals, start with the national security threats, recent border crossers. Tom Homan knows that. I know he knows that because he used to work for me,” said Johnson of Trump’s pick to be “border czar” in his second term.  He continued, “And I’d rather see ERO go after the criminals versus somebody who’s been in this country 12 years, committed no crimes, has children who are U.S. citizens. And that’s the reality of enforcement and that’s — I’m sure that will be the reality of enforcement even under a President Trump.”  Enforcement and Removal Operations, or ERO, is the division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) responsible for the arrest and removal of undocumented immigrants.  Advertisement  Moments later, Welker told the show’s panel that it could be a “little bit tougher” for Trump to tackle his agenda as Republicans control the House by a “very narrow margin.”  Stephen Hayes, editor of The Dispatch, said this could make it “somewhat tenuous” for Trump.  “But I think that argues in favor of Donald Trump being aggressive on executive actions,” he added.  “He said he ran on tariffs. He ran on mass deportations. We know that these are issues that he cares about viscerally in a way that he doesn’t care about some other issues viscerally. I expect him to go as far as he possibly can in those two areas.”",US,-0.7526

Do you have an actual plan at this point for health care?” Welker asked in reference to Trump’s vague claim during his debate with Kamala Harris.  Advertisement  “Yes, we have concepts of a plan that would be better,” Trump replied.  “Still just concepts? Do you have a fully developed plan?” asked the host of “Meet the Press.”  “We have the biggest health care companies looking at it. We have doctors who are always looking. Because Obamacare stinks, it’s lousy. There are better answers,” he said.  He continued: “If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I’d do something about it. But until we have that or until they can approve it — we’re not going to go through the big deal. I am the one that saved Obamacare, I will say, and I did the right thing.”  Trump, when asked if Americans will see his “fully developed” plan, said he doesn’t know if people will “see it at all.”  Advertisement  He told Welker that Americans with preexisting conditions will still have coverage under his “concepts of a plan” and declared that he wants “better health care for less money.”  The president-elect — who promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act during his 2016 campaign — has tried to rewrite history on his Obamacare record by claiming that he tried to “save” the law during his first term as president.  Earlier in the interview, Welker cited Republicans who told her it’s “no longer feasible” to repeal and replace Obamacare because it’s “so entrenched in the system.”  Advertisement  “Do you see it that way? Is that now off the table?” she asked.  In response, Trump slammed the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for his thumbs-down vote against repealing the ACA’s individual mandate. He went on to describe how he made it so Obamacare “works.”  “But you did try to overturn it, sir,” Welker noted.  “It’s lou — well, it’s lousy,” Trump said.  “You did try to overturn it. You did have your Justice Department try to direct the Supreme Court to overturn it,” she continued.  Trump claimed he got a “little bit of a surprising opinion” from the court before adding that Americans would have had “much better” health care if it were overturned.  Advertisement",US,0.9903

The Monday decision partially reversed a 2023 preliminary injunction that blocked enforcement of the state’s abortion trafficking law on First Amendment grounds. Although some national abortion rights groups described the ruling as “devastating for young people in Idaho,” an attorney for the pro-choice plaintiffs in the case told HuffPost on Friday there was one major victory in the ongoing case.  Advertisement  The Monday decision is only a small part of a larger case surrounding the state’s so-called “abortion trafficking” law. Litigation is currently ongoing and the merits of the case have yet to be argued. The law is not currently in effect.  The law, signed last year by Gov. Brad Little (R), created a new felony called “abortion trafficking,” defined as when an “adult ... with the intent to conceal an abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant, unemancipated minor, either procures an abortion … or obtains an abortion-inducing drug” for that minor. “Abortion trafficking” also involves “recruiting, harboring, or transporting” a pregnant minor for an abortion, the law states. Violations are punishable by two to five years in prison.  The law’s sweeping language seeks to criminalize anyone transporting a pregnant minor without parental consent with the intent to get an abortion, or any adult offering counseling to a pregnant minor on the minor’s reproductive health options.  Advertisement  Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a vocal opponent of abortion, called the ruling a “tremendous victory” in a press release.  “Idaho’s laws were passed specifically to protect the life of the unborn and the life of the mother,” Labrador said. “Trafficking a minor child for an abortion without parental consent puts both in grave danger, and we will not stop protecting life in Idaho.”  The court’s ruling said that the state can enforce the “harboring” and “transporting” part of the law, but it cannot enforce the “recruiting” statute. The anti-abortion Republicans who wrote the law did not define “recruiting,” which the appeals court found to be “unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expressive speech.”  Advertisement  This part of the ruling was a “huge victory,” said Wendy Heipt, an attorney for the plaintiffs. It’s the first abortion case at the federal level to acknowledge a person’s right to freely discuss abortion even if obtaining care is illegal in a person’s home state.  “I can’t stress enough how important it is that the most vulnerable people in Idaho ― which are minors in situations that are unsafe or violent ― can now actually turn to trusted adults and learn what their options are,” Heipt told HuffPost.  Raul Labrador, Idaho's attorney general, speaks outside the US Supreme Court earlier this year. Labrador has advocated for an interstate abortion ban travel as well as banning health-stabilizing abortions for women in medical emergencies. Bloomberg via Getty Images  Advertisement  The panel of judges effectively said Idaho cannot criminalize people who are simply providing information about abortion, including educational counseling, encouragement or how to logistically or financially obtain abortion care. Idahoans are protected by free speech to talk to anyone, including minors, about abortion care ― even if abortion is largely illegal in the state, the court ruled.  The judges used a hypothetical situation in their ruling to portray how slippery the slope would be if the state could prosecute people for “recruiting” minors under this law:  “Imagine an Idaho resident who lives near the border of Oregon and displays a bumper sticker that reads: ‘Legal abortions are okay, and they’re right next door. Ask me about it!’ A minor sees the sticker and, feeling desperate, approaches the driver to request a ride across state lines. ‘I need an abortion,’ the minor says, ‘and my parents can’t know.’ The driver says: ‘I’m sorry, I can’t drive you there. But, here, take this cash. That should cover the procedure.’ The minor takes the cash, finds a ride to Oregon with another minor, and gets a legal abortion with the money the driver provided. Under Section 18-623, the driver might be prosecuted for ‘recruiting.’ The driver’s expression invited contact, causing the minor to approach and find out how to get a legal abortion. The bumper sticker, and perhaps the offer of cash, arguably persuaded or even induced the minor to have the abortion. The cash also paid for, or ‘procured,’ the abortion. Thus, the driver procured an abortion for the minor, in part by recruiting.”  The ruling on the “recruiting” provision sets some kind of legal standard for other states looking to pass similar laws. Tennessee passed a similar law this year that is currently blocked with a preliminary injunction, and Republicans in Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi introduced similar abortion trafficking laws in 2024 that failed. A New Hampshire Republican has already filed a similar abortion travel ban for the state’s upcoming legislative session.  The court’s decision on the recruitment statute also offers some legal basis for future attacks on pro-choice groups that provide abortion counseling or financial aid for abortion.  Advertisement  “Idahoans should be concerned and upset about what the legislators are doing and what the law still does ― absolutely,” Heipt said. “But they should be so relieved that they can still talk about and support abortion.”  Read the 9th Circuit’s decision below:  This article was updated throughout with quotes from Heipt to better reflect the impact of Monday’s ruling.",US,-0.1637

Of the 10 states where abortion rights were on the ballot on Tuesday, seven voted to expand or enshrine abortion rights. The results are emblematic of what pro-choice advocates have been saying for decades: Abortion rights are widely popular.  In the biggest win of the night, deep-red Missouri decided to codify abortion protections into the state constitution. The measure will repeal the state’s near-total abortion ban and restore access until around 24 weeks of pregnancy — marking the first time since Roe v. Wade fell that voters have overturned an abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest.  Advertisement  Voters in Maryland and Colorado supported amendments to enshrine abortion access throughout pregnancy — a progressive win in states that have become safe havens for abortion care later in pregnancy. Notably, Colorado’s amendment also repeals a 1984 state law that barred the use of public funds for abortion care.  Arizona, Montana and Nevada all voted to pass amendments that codify abortion through fetal viability, or around 24 weeks of pregnancy, into the state constitution.  New Yorkers passed a historic amendment to expand the state’s equal rights amendment to include pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. The amendment also includes protections against discrimination based on ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.  Advertisement  People at an election night watch party react after an abortion rights amendment in Missouri passed. AP Photo/Charlie Riedel  Three states — Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota — voted against abortion rights. A slim majority of Nebraska voters supported an anti-abortion amendment to codify the state’s current 12-week abortion ban, beating out the state’s competing abortion rights measure.  Florida’s outcome was particularly heartbreaking for pro-choice groups because a majority of Floridians (57%) supported the amendment, voting to restore abortion access until fetal viability. But because voters didn’t meet the state’s 60% threshold for amending the state constitution, Amendment 4 did not pass.  Advertisement  “The reality is because of Florida’s constitution a minority ― a minority ― a minority of Florida voters have decided that Amendment 4 will not be adopted,” Lauren Brenzel, director of the Yes On 4 campaign, said during her Tuesday night concession speech.  “Republicans, Democrats and Independents do not support these extreme bans on abortion. They are tired of women dying because of abortion bans,” she continued. “...A bipartisan group of voters today sent a clear message to the Florida legislature.”  Despite 7 out of 10 states voting to protect abortion care, voters still supported a presidential candidate who will very likely decimate women’s reproductive health care. Donald Trump may have shied away from his anti-abortion record on the campaign trail, but now that he’s headed to the White House, those guardrails will likely fall by the wayside.  Advertisement  Trump has waffled on a national abortion ban, but many of his allies laid out a blueprint for how to ban abortion nationwide in Project 2025.  A federal abortion ban would trump state rights, including the abortion rights measures that seven states passed last night, according to Mary Ziegler, an expert in reproductive health law at the University of California, Davis, School of Law. The Comstock Act, an archaic law that bans the mailing of abortion pills, would also likely supersede state rights if Trump enforces it as a national abortion ban.  Although the GOP won control of the Senate, control of the House — and with it, Trump’s ability to pass a national abortion ban through Congress — is still up in the air.  Advertisement  “Yet again, the people have spoken loudly and clearly: abortion is health care, and politicians do not deserve the right to make people’s medical decisions,” Pro-Choice Caucus co-chairs Reps. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said in Wednesday statement.  “In the months and years to come, there is no doubt we face a daunting path to securing reproductive freedom nationwide,” the statement continues. “We are clear-eyed about the threats ahead, from emboldened Republican extremists to a hostile White House and administration. We believe in a future of reproductive freedom for every American, and we will never stop fighting for you.”  There will be litigation in every state that passed an abortion rights amendment on Tuesday night. Opponents of the measures will likely bring legal challenges against the successful initiatives and fight to keep other abortion regulations in place, like waiting periods and mandatory counseling.",US,0.974

But their impact was barely noticeable in the overall economy, even if their aftershocks were clear in specific industries.  The data show they never fully delivered on his promised factory jobs. Nor did they provoke the avalanche of inflation that critics feared.  Advertisement  This time, though, his tariff threats might be different.  The president-elect is talking about going much bigger — on a potential scale that creates more uncertainty about whether he’ll do what he says and what the consequences could be.  “There’s going to be a lot more tariffs, I mean, he’s pretty clear,” said Michael Stumo, the CEO of Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that has supported import taxes to help domestic manufacturing.  The president-elect posted on social media Monday that on his first day in office he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada until those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States.  Advertisement  Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. But on Wednesday, Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States.  Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump listens during a campaign rally at Santander Arena, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Reading, Pa. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) via Associated Press  Trump also posted on Monday that Chinese imports would face additional tariffs of 10% until Beijing cracks down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl.  Advertisement  Democrats and business groups warn of risks from Trump’s tariff threats  Business groups were quick to warn about rapidly escalating inflation. House Democrats put together legislation to strip a president’s ability to unilaterally apply tariffs this drastic, warning that they would likely lead to higher prices for autos, shoes, housing and groceries.  Sheinbaum initially said Wednesday that her administration is already working up a list of possible retaliatory tariffs “if the situation comes to that.” Similarly, the Canadian government has also started to explore retaliatory tariffs if Trump takes action.  House Democrats on Tuesday introduced a bill that would require congressional approval for a president to impose tariffs due to claims of a national emergency, a largely symbolic action given Republicans’ coming control of both the House and Senate.  Advertisement  “This legislation would enable Congress to limit this sweeping emergency authority and put in place the necessary Congressional oversight before any president – Democrat or Republican – could indiscriminately raise costs on the American people through tariffs,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash.  Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, President of Mexico, speaks during a briefing conference about the rescue of Mexican Petroleum (PEMEX), at the National Palace. (Photo by Carlos Santiago/Eyepix Group/LightRocket via Getty Images) Eyepix Group via Getty Images  But for Trump, tariffs are now a tested tool that seems less politically controversial even if the mandate he received in November’s election largely involved restraining inflation.  Advertisement  The tariffs he imposed on China in his first term were continued by President Joe Biden, a Democrat who even expanded tariffs and restrictions on the world’s second largest economy. Biden administration officials looked at removing Trump’s tariffs in order to bring down inflationary pressures, only to find they were unlikely to help significantly.  Tariffs were “so new and unique that it freaked everybody out in 2017,” said Stumo, but they are now seen as part of the policy toolkit by the United States and other countries.  Trump’s first term tariffs had a modest impact on economy  Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines at the start of 2018, moves that might have pushed up prices in those sectors even though they also overlapped with plans to open washing machine plants in Tennessee and South Carolina.  Advertisement  His administration also levied tariffs on steel and aluminum, including against allies. He then increased tariffs on China, leading to a trade conflict and a limited 2020 agreement that failed to produce the promised Chinese purchases of U.S. goods.  Still, the dispute changed relations with China as more U.S. companies looked for alternative suppliers in other countries. Economic research also found the United States may have sacrificed some of its “soft power” as the Chinese population began to watch fewer American movies.  The Federal Reserve kept inflation roughly on target, but factory construction spending never jumped in a way that suggested a lasting gain in manufacturing jobs. Separate economic research found the tariff war with China did nothing economically for the communities hurt by offshoring, but it did help Trump and Republicans in those communities politically.  Advertisement  When Trump first became president in 2017, the federal government collected $34.6 billion in customs, duties and fees. That sum more than doubled under Trump to $70.8 billion in 2019, according to Office of Management and Budget records.  While that sum might seem meaningful, it was relatively small compared with the overall economy. America’s gross domestic product is now $29.3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The total tariffs collected in the United States would equal less than 0.3% of GDP.  Trump wants much more far-reaching tariffs going forward  The new tariffs being floated by Trump now are dramatically larger and there could be far more significant impacts.  Advertisement  If Mexico, Canada, and China faced the additional tariffs proposed by Trump on all goods imported to the United States, that could be roughly equal to $266 billion in tax collections, a number that does not assume any disruptions in trade or retaliatory moves by other countries. The cost of those taxes would likely be borne by U.S. families, importers and domestic and foreign companies in the form of higher prices or lower profits.  Former Biden administration officials said they worried that companies could piggyback on Trump’s tariffs — if they’re imposed — as a rationale to raise their prices. This would mirror price increases by many companies in 2022 that were made possible because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy prices and gave the companies cover to further raise their own prices.  “I’m very worried about the total indiscriminate tariffs on more than China — that it gives cover to firms to jack up prices,” said Jen Harris, a former Biden White House official who is now director of the Economy and Society Initiative at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.  Advertisement  But what Trump didn’t really spell out is what might cause him to back down on tariffs and declare a victory. What he is creating instead with his tariff threats is a sense of uncertainty as companies and countries await the details to figure out what all of this could mean.  “We know the key economic policy priorities of the incoming Trump administration, but we don’t know how or when they will be addressed,” said Greg Daco, chief U.S. economist at EY-Parthenon.  __",US,0.511

The Commerce Department’s first estimate of economic growth in the July-September quarter, out Wednesday morning, found a 2.8% growth rate, a solid pace likely to keep unemployment down and wages rising.  Advertisement  On Tuesday, the Conference Board, a think tank, reported that its monthly consumer confidence measure jumped to 108.7 in October from 99.2 in September. That’s the biggest one-month change since March 2021, when the U.S. economy was still moving out of the slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Even gas prices have turned more favorable for the White House. The automotive organization AAA said the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.135 on Wednesday, and ranged as low as $2.897 to $2.687 in the Southern and central states.  The White House touted the statistics, the last major set of data that will be released ahead of the election aside from the October jobs report Friday.  Advertisement  “It wasn’t so long ago when commentators were certain that we would need a recession to beat inflation caused by the pandemic,” Lael Brainard, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters Wednesday. “But it’s now clear we’ve been able to bring inflation down to rates from before the pandemic while growing faster than projected. And that didn’t happen by accident.”  However, the reports, and Brainard’s assessment, stand in stark contrast with how voters perceive the economy. An Economist/YouGov survey found that 97% of respondents felt the economy was important and 38% of those polled felt the economy was in poor shape, compared to only 51% who felt it was fair or good.  But with the widely watched Dow Jones Industrial Average of stocks hitting record highs in recent weeks, the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates as insurance against a downturn, and price growth continuing to moderate, there are signs the economic mood may be lifting just in time to help Harris in her quest to succeed fellow Democrat Joe Biden as president.  Advertisement  The consumer confidence report data showed that expectations of the economy entering a recession fell in September, to their lowest levels since at least July 2022. Respondents’ expectations for their families’ financial situation six months from now were also the highest since then.  Brainard said the new estimate of economic growth, the first before revisions in November and December, brought the annual average rate of economic growth under Biden to 3.2%, the highest of any president since the turn of the century.  However, that hasn’t kept GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and his allies from talking about how inflation hit a four-decade high in 2022, and saying the economy had been artificially propped up.  Advertisement  Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, who has endorsed Trump, recently said federal debt has fueled the economy, and that budget cuts supported by Trump would cause “temporary hardship” for some people.  The next big economic report will be the monthly jobs tally released by the Labor Department on Friday morning. According to a survey of economists by Reuters, the projected growth in payrolls is only 90,000 jobs. That would be the lowest number in a while, as October saw a brief port strike as well as economic disruptions from Hurricane Helene in the Southeastern U.S.  Brainard downplayed expectations, calling the Labor release “a noisy report.”  “We anticipate that the payroll numbers will be lower as a result of those disruptions,” she said. “But nonetheless, we don’t anticipate that this will in any way affect the underlying trend. And the underlying trend, as you can see in several months of data, has been quite resilient.”",US,0.9632

Vice President Kamala Harris, who took Biden’s place as the Democratic presidential nominee, ultimately lost the election to her GOP opponent, President-elect Donald Trump. Carville argues that Biden’s initial wavering, and the Democrats’ subsequent electoral loss, turned an otherwise admirable run into a failure.  “The most tragic figure in American politics in my lifetime is President Biden,” Carville declared.

Advertisement  Charlamagne, the outspoken “The Breakfast Club” radio show co-host, argued Wednesday on “The View” that the bipartisan condemnation of the pardon is “valid” because “Democrats stand on this moral high ground all the time” — and “act so self-righteous” about justice.  Joe Biden previously said he would not intervene in his son’s impending prosecutions. He also stated on social media following the guilty verdict of President-elect Donald Trump in his New York City criminal trial in May that “No one is above the law.”  “He could have said, ‘Hey man, I’m not focused on that right now,’ but since they were calling Trump a threat to democracy and they were saying nobody is above the law ... [they contradicted what] they were running on,” Charlamagne said Wednesday.  Advertisement  He continued, “So when he kept saying things like, ‘Ah, you know, nobody is above the law, I respect the jury’s decision in regards to my son,’ he didn’t believe that! But he didn’t have to volunteer that lie to begin with.”  That last line earned Charlamagne some temporary ire from Goldberg.  “I’m going to stop you for a second,” she said, and argued to the radio host, born Lenard McKelvey, that he doesn’t actually know if “it was a lie” or why the president reversed course regarding the pardon.  “You really think he just changed his mind over Thanksgiving weekend all of a sudden?” Charlamagne asked.  Advertisement  “I think he changed his mind because he got sick of watching everybody else get over,” said Goldberg. “At some point, you get to the place where you just go, ’So I’m just going to follow the straight and narrow, always, ‘cause that’s what’s expected of Democrats?’”  Charlamagne said the expectation in this case came from the president himself, however, and slammed the team-based mentality of partisan loyalists who “refuse to be objective” about their own party.  Goldberg, a Democrat, said in response, “Democrats are not a monolith.”  “Why can’t you say when Democrats are wrong?” Charlamagne replied. “And why can’t Republicans say when Republicans are wrong?”  Advertisement  Goldberg claimed she does hold the party accountable on the air and reiterated that she doesn’t think the pardon was a political mistake.  Charlamagne called her response “ridiculous,” which Goldberg misheard as an insult, prompting him to repeat his claim and make amends on air.  “I didn’t say you were ridiculous, Ms. Goldberg,” said Charlamagne before they hugged. “I would never.”",US,-0.9437
https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-rookie-xavier-worthy-calls-dream-come-true-having-patrick-mahomes-his-quarterback,Fox News,right,Trending,Chiefs rookie Xavier Worthy calls it 'dream come true' having Patrick Mahomes as his quarterback,"Every rookie entering the NFL wishes to make an immediate impact on their team, especially first-round picks who carry loads of expectation when they hear their names called by Commissioner Roger Goodell on Draft night.  After breaking the 40-yard dash record at the NFL Scouting Combine, Xavier Worthy raised his draft stock, entering that zone of being a potential first-round pick.  All offseason, the Kansas City Chiefs were among teams looking for another playmaker to work with Patrick Mahomes on offense. With the 28th overall pick in hand, Worthy was still available, and they wasted no time adding his speed to the roster.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  While being over the moon that he was selected in the first round, Worthy quickly realized he had a two-time MVP, three-time Super Bowl champion and six-time Pro Bowl quarterback that would be throwing him the football.  One can guess how he feels about that after 13 games and a 12-1 record.  ""It’s kinda like a dream come true,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital ahead of Week 15.  CHIEFS ROOKIE XAVIER WORTHY SAYS TEAM THRIVES PLAYING IN VILLAIN ROLE: ‘EVERYBODY JUST WANTS US TO LOSE’  Worthy understood there was no time to geek out over Mahomes being his new signal caller. It was time to get to work, and he quickly realized that all the winning that comes with being a Chief is business at the end of the day.  ""You see why they win when you’re here,"" Worthy explained. ""They work hard, they go about their business the right way. They have the slogan called ‘The Formula’ – I feel like Coach Reid has hit [on] that in an interview. They really go about that every day, and I feel like it says a lot about the program.""  Of course, Worthy was not guaranteed to slot right in and get working with Mahomes immediately. First, he had to learn the playbook and then develop chemistry with his new quarterback on the practice field and in games.  Well, his first touch of his career, Worthy took an end-around flip from Mahomes to the house for a 21-yard rushing touchdown against the Baltimore Ravens.  Since then, Worthy has totaled 38 receptions on 67 targets for 448 yards with four touchdowns through the air, as well as 54 rushing yards and two touchdowns on the ground.  He feels the trust a quarterback needs in his receiver is there, leading to some pretty good first-year numbers.  ""Pat, he’s more of a guy that’s like, if you show you can go out there and do it, and he trusts you, and you earn his trust, he’s going to trust you throughout the season,"" Worthy said about Mahomes. ""I feel like I’ve earned his trust, and I feel like we’ve got something good rolling.""  A prime example of that came in the latest close-game victory for the Chiefs, which required Mahomes to orchestrate another game-winning drive.  On fourth-and-6 with the game on the line, Mahomes was scrambling around the pocket as the Los Angeles Chargers' pass rush was barreling through his offensive line, looking for a receiver to give him a chance to extend the drive.  Mahomes could have looked to Travis Kelce, DeAndre Hopkins or other veteran options if he wished. However, knowing where Worthy was going to be, he released the ball just as he turned around to look at his quarterback. Worthy ran back to the ball, secured it and kept the team's chances of winning alive.  Job well done, even if there was some pain involved.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play. I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video,"" Worthy said. ""But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  The stacked wins have resulted in what every rookie wants: playoff football.  Worthy gets that as the Chiefs secured the AFC West title for the ninth straight season after beating the Chargers, and the rookie is excited to continue developing that relationship with Mahomes to hopefully help their case for a third straight Super Bowl victory.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.

""It was fun,"" he said of the experience. ""It was always something I wanted to do just to give back to the community where I’m at, and it was just fun to see the reactions on the kids’ faces.

The lawsuit accused Jay-Z and Diddy of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000, Fox News Digital previously confirmed. Before Jay-Z was named, the rapper received a demand letter likely in an attempt to settle.  ""Things have escalated,"" Orange County criminal defense lawyer Lauren Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital, as the back-and-forth between Jay-Z's legal team and Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee now plays out in the public eye.  JAY-Z'S ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT: CAN RAP MOGUL FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES?  Fox News Digital looks back at the timeline leading to Jay-Z being named in the bombshell lawsuit:  Diddy accused of raping 13-year-old girl  Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was first accused of raping a 13-year-old while celebrities watched in October. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York on Oct. 20 by Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee on behalf of a Jane Doe.  The unidentified woman ended up at a VMAs afterparty after attempting to gain entry to the awards show at Radio City Music Hall, according to court documents.  ""One of the limousine drivers she spoke to claimed to work for [Diddy],"" the lawsuit read. ""He told her that Combs liked younger girls and said she ‘fit what Diddy was looking for,’ not allowing her into the Awards, but inviting her to an afterparty.""  The girl claimed after being given one drink, she found a room to lie down in because she became ""woozy and lightheaded."" At one point, Combs and two unidentified celebrities entered the room. ""Celebrity A"" allegedly raped the 13-year-old while Combs and ""Celebrity B"" watched. Afterwards, the young girl claimed Combs raped her while ""Celebrity A"" and ""Celebrity B"" watched.  Diddy denied the allegations in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.  WATCH ON FOX NATION: WHAT DIDDY DO?  Jay-Z receives a demand letter regarding the sexual assault lawsuit against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs  At some point, Jay-Z received a demand letter from the anonymous accuser's lawyer – unbeknownst to the public. Jay-Z confirmed this information in his statement denying the rape accusation.  ""My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a ‘lawyer’ named Tony Buzbee ,"" Jay-Z shared in the statement on Roc Nation's social media. ""What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.  ""No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!""  ""Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes."" — Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot  The decision to eventually publicly name Jay-Z was likely due to ""a failure to settle the case,"" a legal expert told Fox News Digital.  ""Jay-Z may have decided that settling the case would suggest to the public that he was somehow involved in the sexual assault of a minor,"" Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot, explained. ""After receiving a demand letter, Jay-Z and his legal team probably pushed back against the Plaintiff's accusations and may have tried to convince her counsel to not proceed with naming him as a Defendant.  ""The Plaintiff's attorney probably made a decision to proceed against Jay-Z after it became apparent that they would not settle the case. Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes.""  Jay-Z files lawsuit claiming extortion under ‘John Doe’  Before Jay-Z was named publicly in the lawsuit accusing him and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of rape, he sued his accuser's lawyer as a celebrity John Doe.  WATCH: JAY-Z ISSUES SCATHING DENIAL TO ALLEGATIONS HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL  On Nov. 18, his lawyers filed a lawsuit against Buzbee. Since then, Jay-Z confirmed he was the plaintiff in the anonymous lawsuit.  ""Plaintiff presently faces a gun to his head,"" the court document, obtained by Fox News Digital, read. Jay-Z's team claimed Buzbee and the anonymous accuser had demanded the rapper ""either repeatedly pay an exorbitant sum of money to stop Defendants from the wide publication of wildly false allegations of sexual assault that would subject [Jay-Z] to opprobrium and irreparably harm [Jay-Z's] reputation, family, career and livelihood, or else face the threat of an untold number of civil suits and financial and personal ruin.""  While Jay-Z accused Buzbee of extortion, legal experts claimed demand letters are typical in these types of cases.  ""It is standard for these types of letters to be sent before filing a case or including a defendant in a case,"" Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital. ""If a case can settle outside of court, that usually benefits everyone involved. It is not extortion, but it can feel like it to the defendant, especially if the ask is high.""  DeGroot added: ""The tone of these letters may vary. Given the high profile nature of Jay-Z, and having a sense that it would be leaked to the press, Mr. Buzbee is starting his litigation spin as early as possible to get the attention of Jay-Z and to influence potential jurors.""

The amended complaint, also filed by Tony Buzbee, named the rap mogul as ""Celebrity A.""  In the new version of the lawsuit, the 13-year-old became disoriented and found a bedroom to rest in after allegedly consuming one drink. Jay-Z, Diddy and female ""Celebrity B"" seemingly followed the girl into the room. She ""immediately recognized all three celebrities,"" according to the court document.  Jay-Z allegedly raped the girl, followed by Diddy's alleged rape of the plaintiff, all while ""celebrity B"" watched, the court document stated.  The ""Empire State of Mind"" rapper denied the allegations in a statement shared on Roc Nation's social media.  ""These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!! Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree? These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case,"" he wrote, in part.  ""Celebrity B"" remains unnamed, but will likely be revealed at some point in the process, according to a legal expert.  ""Since that person's participation appears to be that of a witness, her status is entirely different, unless there is a legal reason,"" DeGroot told Fox News Digital. ""It certainly appears that the celebrity would not want to be tarred with the same brush as Jay-Z and P. Diddy. Unless there is a protective order, her identity will in all likelihood be revealed during the discovery process.""  ""Celebrity B"" is ""undoubtedly"" in communication with Buzbee through a lawyer, Johnson-Norris noted.

Belichick sat in front of the media during his introductory press conference as the new head coach for the Tar Heels – an idea no college football fan would've fathomed until rumors began to swirl last week about his interest in running the program.  It was always thought that Belichick, who is 27 wins away from becoming the head coach with the most victories in NFL history, would return to the pros if he wished to continue coaching.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  But the 72-year-old explained on Thursday afternoon why he chose to go the college route.  ""​​I’ve always wanted to coach in college football,"" Belichick said. ""It just never really worked out. Had some good years in the NFL, so that was OK. But this is really a dream come true.""  BILL BELICHICK AGREES TO BECOME UNC'S NEXT HEAD FOOTBALL COACH  Belichick is obviously being modest by saying his time in the NFL was just ""good.""  Before the Kansas City Chiefs, he developed the New England Patriots into a dynasty, winning six Super Bowls and racking up wins that brought about the argument of greatest NFL head coach of all time.  College football, though, is a completely different beast, especially in this new NIL world. But these aren't waters Belichick just wants to dip his toes in – he's diving straight in and not looking to get out.  ""I didn't come here to leave,"" he said, dispelling thoughts for now that he's just trying to coach again before that next NFL opportunity opens up.  Belichick did say that, while the process may be different, the pros and college do have ""a lot of parallels."" It's why Michael Lombardi is coming in as the team's general manager, someone who knows how Belichick functions given their time together in New England.  ""I think that's the reason for the general structure with Michael as the general manager and myself as the coach and working collaboratively as we have done in a professional structure,"" Belichick explained.  For this big leap to be successful, Belichick knows he just needs to take things one day at a time. That starts with putting together his coaching staff, which he has already touched on with Freddie Kitchens coming aboard. More announcements should be made in the coming weeks.  Recruiting, not drafting, will also be interesting to watch with Belichick, but reports have indicated his wish for UNC to have the proper NIL resources to land top talent to make the program competitive.  As someone who was around the program as a kid – his father, Steve Belichick, coached with the Tar Heels in the 1950s – he understands what it means to be successful in Chapel Hill.

How could he not be happy when he is 12-1 to start off his first season in the NFL. Not many rookies get that luxury.  However, the first-round pick learned quickly what comes with the territory of being a team in search of three Super Bowls – playing the villain role.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Worthy, who broke the NFL Scouting Combine 40-yard dash record back in April, said he hears the outside noise, especially those wanting the Chiefs to lose each week.  ""I feel like everybody just wants us to lose,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital after highlighting the fun he had with the DICKS Holiday Shopping Sprint to impact kids in the Kansas City area for the holidays.  CHIEFS' ALTERNATE REALITY: KANSAS CITY WOULD BE 2011 IF THEIR ONE-SCORE GAME RESULTS WERE FLIPPED IN 2024  ""Every week, it’s a new excuse. First, the goal post is helping us. Then, it’s the refs helping us. I mean, we can’t get a break. But it’s cool to have that. It shows that everybody wants us to lose, we have a target on our backs, and we have to continue working each and every week.""  The Chiefs are a dynasty, and Worthy entered the fray right after they defeated the San Francisco 49ers in overtime to collect back-to-back Vince Lombardi trophies.  Just ask any other dynasty in the NFL what happens when they are on top. Fans will raise them up and ultimately want to watch them fall with a new winner crowned.  However, Worthy brings up a reason why some fans cannot stand to watch the Chiefs stack wins. They have been in so many close games this season, but they have maintained their winning streak in those one-score bouts.  For the last 15 games that have been determined by one score, the Chiefs have come out victorious. Yes, the goal post was involved this past week as Matthew Wright doinked it off the left side, but it went through to beat the Los Angeles Chargers. Additionally, there have been some controversial calls that have gone the Chiefs' way in the end.  Being the villain, though, is not something the Chiefs care about. They embrace it, and Worthy is just getting a taste of what Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and other veterans on the team have been feeling since last season.  ""It fuels us,"" Worthy explained. ""A lot of people say it’s hate, like, ‘Oh, people are always going against us.’ But how we look at it, the world’s watching us. You have all these eyes – you make the best of the opportunity with all these eyes on you.""  Worthy is no stranger to having a target on his back after playing for a large college program like the Texas Longhorns.  CHIEFS ARE KINGS OF CLOSING OUT GAMES, AND WHAT ELSE WE LEARNED IN WEEK 14  However, he touched on the senior leadership that helps guide the pact, especially Mahomes, who he continues to build a rapport with each week.  The proof is in the game tape, as Mahomes, scrambling on fourth-and-6 to continue the team's game-winning drive, threw a pass to Worthy with the game on the line, and he came back to the ball, secured it and kept the drive alive.  He even injured himself on the play, but his quarterback trusted him with the game on the line. A little pain is worth it in that case.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play,"" he said. ""I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video. But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  With four games remaining and the AFC West title locked up for the ninth straight season, Worthy knows he will also be a rookie that enjoys playoff football at the end of the regular season.  He is also well aware that the target will be even larger with the Chiefs looking to become the first team ever to win three straight Super Bowls.  If Kansas City has to be the villain to do so, then that is perfectly fine for Worthy, who is solely focused on being the team's hero when it is his turn to make a play.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.

Jay-Z allegedly raped the girl, followed by Diddy's alleged rape of the plaintiff, all while ""celebrity B"" watched, the court document stated.

In a statement provided to Fox News Digital, Diddy's reps once again denied the allegations.

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bill-belichick-unc-head-football-coach,Fox News,right,Trending,Bill Belichick agrees to become UNC's next head football coach,"Look out Chapel Hill, Bill Belichick is coming.  Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels finalized a deal for the 72-year-old to become their next head football coach, the university officially announced on Wednesday night.  ""I am excited for the opportunity at UNC-Chapel Hill. I grew up around college football with my Dad and treasured those times,"" Belichick wrote in a statement. ""I have always wanted to coach in college and now I look forward to building the football program in Chapel Hill.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  OutKick's Trey Wallace reports that UNC will give Belichick a five-year deal worth upwards of $50 million.  The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach remained interested in returning to the sidelines at some point in the future, but it was always expected that he would make his way back to the NFL after missing out on a new gig following his departure from the New England Patriots before this season. After all, Belichick had been in the league in some role since 1975 prior to this season.  But earlier this week, The Guardian US reported that Belichick agreed to become the new head coach in Chapel Hill, adding that Belichick handed the school a 400 page ""organizational bible"" with structure, payment plans, staffing choices etc.  Wallace reports one of the biggest components to the deal was Belichick having enough NIL money to compete in the recruiting space, which was agreed to. He also wanted to pick his assistant coaches, and UNC is giving them the resources to get who he wants, even if buyouts are necessary.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Among those assistants expected to join the staff is Stephen Belichick, his son who serves as Washington's defensive coordinator. It was reported that the elder Belichick had the unusual request of wanting his son to become his successor, stepping in when he decides to leave the program.  This will mark Belichick's first stint as a college football coach. His father, Steve Belichick, was a longtime assistant coach at Navy. But he did have a stint in the 1950s with the Tar Heels.  Belichick has spent much of the ongoing NFL season in the media spotlight after his interviews for NFL jobs didn't lead to a job offer.  While he interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons in January, the franchise opted against extending an offer. Belichick did not appear to draw much interest from any other NFL team, but his regular appearances on ESPN's ""ManningCast"" and the CW's ""Inside the NFL"" have kept him close to football.  During an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" earlier this week, Belichick confirmed he had talks with UNC about their head coaching vacancy, adding that he spent the 11 months since his departure from the Patriots taking a ""longer look"" at college football throughout the season as opposed to during the spring lead-up to the draft as a pro coach.  ""So it’s been, it’s been a good year for me. I’ve learned a lot,"" Belichick said. ""So, I’ve had the opportunity to talk to Chancellor [Lee] Roberts, and we’ve had a couple of good conversations. So we’ll see how it goes.""  Belichick opted not to go into more detail when asked by McAfee. Instead, Belichick offered a quip about his reputation for giving terse responses during news conferences with the Patriots.  ""Yeah, let’s just leave it at that, Pat,"" Belichick said with a grin. ""I mean, I don’t want to give out too much information. I want to get my press conference aura back.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Belichick shared some details about the makeup of a college program if he were a head coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" he said. ""It would be a professional program — training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history. He finished the 2023 season with 333 career wins — which places him in second on the all-time coaches wins list. Don Shula's 347 wins still leads all coaches.",US,0.9967
https://www.foxnews.com/sports/unc-on-board-have-bill-belichick-become-next-head-coach-still-working-out-issues-deal-report,Fox News,right,Trending,"UNC 'on board' to have Bill Belichick become next head coach, still working out issues with deal","Bill Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels are working to close a deal to make him their next head football coach, which would be his first-ever time coaching in college.  However, ESPN reported that ""there are still issues that both sides need to work through.""  The report adds that the ""ball is in Belichick’s court"" as UNC officials are indeed on board with him taking over the program. And there is expected to be a ""resolution"" soon.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  In fact, OutKick's Trey Wallace reports it's come down to just NIL money, which was among the issues that needed to be worked out in the negotiations. If that can be agreed to, an emergency trustee meeting would be called to finalize the deal.  What exactly are the other issues? Well, the potential role of Belichick’s son, Washington Huskies defensive coordinator Stephen Belichick, is one of them.  It was reported by The Guardian that, among the elder Belichick’s stipulations, his son would be named his heir to the head coach role once the 72-year-old moves on, whenever that would be.  ESPN added Belichick’s salary for taking over and more need to be ironed out before a deal can be agreed to.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  It came as a shock when Belichick’s name was floated for the Tar Heels' vacant position after longtime head coach Mack Brown said he wouldn’t return after this season.  Some of Belichick’s ex-pupils, like Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, had some fun on FOX NFL Sunday this past week mimicking their old coach trying to deal with recruiting in this NIL age of college sports.  ""There’s a lot of things he can do, and obviously he’s tremendous, and even showing his personality. But getting out there on the recruiting trail and dealing with all these college kids,"" Brady said on the NFL pregame show. ""’Listen, do you really want to come here?’"" Brady said, acting as Belichick. ""’I mean, we don’t really want you anyway, but I guess you could come, we’ll figure out if you play.’""  But this wasn’t just a publicity stunt. There’s more than just mutual interest in Belichick’s return to coaching in Chapel Hill.  ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Belichick and UNC officials spent five hours discussing a potential deal on Sunday, and in typical Belichick fashion, he wouldn’t divulge any details during his weekly spot on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Monday morning.  He admitted having a ""couple of good conversations"" with Lee Roberts, UNC’s chancellor, and added, ""We’ll see how that goes.""  If a deal goes through, it would be one of the most polarizing head coach hires for a college program in history, as Belichick has only ever been a head coach in the NFL, where he won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots.  FORMER NFL COACH BRUCE ARIANS OFFERS ADVICE TO BILL BELICHICK AS NORTH CAROLINA FOOTBALL COACHING RUMORS SWIRL  His time with the franchise came to an end before this 2024 season. They mutually parted ways and Belichick’s attempts at finding another role elsewhere were all for naught. He has since joined the sports media space, offering his insight to various outlets, including ESPN, but being open to another opportunity in football was always in the cards.  However, it was always expected that such an opportunity would come from the NFL, and there are several head coaching roles already open in the league, making this situation even more surprising.  But Belichick told McAfee and his crew what would happen if he were to become a college football coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" Belichick said. ""It would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Simply put, Belichick would bring to college football the system he knows works in the NFL, aiming for good players to join his team who will one day turn pro with the tools necessary for easy acclimation.  Time will tell if that program will be at UNC, but it appears some boxes need to be checked before a groundbreaking deal crosses the finish line.

The Boston Red Sox have landed Crochet in a blockbuster trade with the Chicago White Sox.  Boston is sending prospect catcher Kyle Teel, outfielder Braden Montgomery, infielder Chase Meidroth and right-handed pitcher Wikelman Gonzalez to the White Sox in exchange for Crochet.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  The New York Mets, who already landed Juan Soto on a record-breaking $765 million deal, were reportedly also in the running for Crochet's services next season. The Red Sox, a team with a deep farm system, unloaded four top-15 prospects to get the deal done, per MLB Pipeline.  What the Red Sox get in return is a budding star in their rotation, which needed a stud from the left side. Crochet is also under cheap team control for two years before becoming a free agent in 2027.  YANKEES SIGN ACE PITCHER TO HISTORIC CONTRACT AFTER LOSING JUAN SOTO SWEEPSTAKES: REPORTS  The White Sox made all the wrong MLB history last season with the worst record ever in a single year, but Crochet was a lone bright spot on the roster.  In his first All-Star season, Crochet pitched to a 3.58 ERA over 146 innings with 209 strikeouts and 33 walks.  His swing-and-miss stuff is what the Red Sox hope can be delivered at Fenway Park and beyond this season as a top-line rotation piece.  After the New York Yankees landed Max Fried, another reported Red Sox target in free agency, on an eight-year deal, Boston GM Craig Breslow quickly pivoted to Crochet to make sure they got a key piece for 2025 and beyond.  The Red Sox are not expected to be done, however. They were in on the Soto sweepstakes while also checking in on other position players as they hope to build a team worthy of reaching the postseason.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As for the White Sox, their rebuild continues, and top prospects like the ones they got in this deal are what’s needed to make that work in the long run.

https://noticias.foxnews.com/media/george-stephanopoulos-abc-apologize-trump-forced-pay-15-million-settle-defamation-suit,Fox News,right,Trending,"George Stephanopoulos y ABC piden disculpas a Trump, se ven obligados a pagar 15 millones de dólares para resolver una demanda por difamación","FIRST ON FOX- ABC News y su principal presentador George Stephanopoulos han llegado a un acuerdo con Donald Trump en su demanda por difamación, por el que la cadena de noticias pagará al presidente electo 15 millones de dólares.  El acuerdo se hizo público el sábado, revelando que las dos partes han llegado a un acuerdo y han evitado un costoso juicio. Según el acuerdo, ABC News pagará 15 millones de dólares como contribución benéfica a una ""fundación y museo presidenciales que serán establecidos por o para el demandante, como los presidentes de los Estados Unidos de América han establecido en el pasado"". Además, la cadena pagará 1 millón de dólares en concepto de honorarios de abogados a Trump.  Stephanopoulos y ABC News también tuvieron que emitir declaraciones de ""arrepentimiento"" como nota del editor al pie de un artículo publicado en Internet el 10 de marzo de 2024, sobre los comentarios realizados a principios de año que llevaron a Trump a presentar la demanda por difamación. La nota dice: ""ABC News y George Stephanopoulos lamentan las declaraciones sobre el presidente Donald J. Trump realizadas durante una entrevista de George Stephanopoulos con el diputado Nancy Mace en el programa This Week de la ABC el 10 de marzo de 2024"".  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, DE ABC NEWS, DIJO INEXACTAMENTE QUE TRUMP FUE DECLARADO ""RESPONSABLE DE VIOLACIÓN"" 10 VECES, DICEN GURÚS JURÍDICOS  ABC News dijo que la cadena estaba ""satisfecha"" de haber concluido el caso.  ""Nos complace que las partes hayan llegado a un acuerdo para desestimar la demanda en los términos de la presentación judicial"", dijo un portavoz de ABC News a Fox News Digital.  Trump presentó una demanda por difamación contra Stephanopoulos después de que éste afirmara que Trump había sido declarado ""responsable de violación"" en una causa civil durante una polémica entrevista con el diputado Nancy Mace, republicano de Carolina del Sur, el pasado mes de marzo.  Tras reproducir un fragmento en el que Mace hablaba de haber sido víctima de una violación, Stephanopoulos le preguntó: ""¿Cómo compaginas tu apoyo a Donald Trump con el testimonio que acabamos de ver?"".  ""Has apoyado a Donald Trump para presidente. Los jueces y dos jurados distintos le han declarado responsable de violación y de difamar a la víctima de esa violación"", dijo Stephanopoulos, en alusión a la victoria legal de la acusadora de Trump , E. Jean Carroll.  Stephanopoulos repitió esa afirmación diez veces durante su rifirrafe con Mace, a pesar de que un jurado determinó realmente que Trump era responsable de ""abuso sexual"", que tiene una definición distinta según la ley de Nueva York.  Después de que el jurado federal declarara a Trump responsable de abuso sexual, pero no de violación, el juez Lewis Kaplan escribió en una sentencia posterior que el hecho de que Carroll no probara la violación ""en el sentido de la Ley Penal de Nueva York no significa que no probara que el Sr. Trump la ""violara"" tal como mucha gente entiende comúnmente la palabra ""violación"""".  FETTERMAN DENUNCIA LOS CASOS LEGALES CONTRA TRUMP, HUNTER BIDEN EN SU PRIMER POST DE TRUTH SOCIAL: LOS DOS CASOS ERAN UNA MIERDA  Al principio, Stephanopoulos se mostró desafiante ante la demanda de Trumpy dijo al presentador de la CBS Stephen Colbert que no se dejaría ""amedrentar para dejar de hacer mi trabajo por una amenaza"".  ""Trump me demandó porque utilicé la palabra 'violación', aunque un juez dijo que eso es de hecho lo que ocurrió. Presentamos una moción de desestimación"", dijo Stephanopoulos.  El acuerdo se alcanzó después de que la juez Lisette M. Reid ordenara el viernes a Trump y Stephanopoulos que prestaran declaración la semana que viene, antes de la fecha límite del 24 de diciembre para que los acusados presentaran una petición de juicio sumario, con el fin de evitar un juicio.  En su demanda contra Stephanopoulos y ABC, Trump estuvo representado por los abogados de Florida Alejandro Brito y Richard Klugh. El acuerdo con ABC se presentó ante el Tribunal Federal del Distrito Sur de Florida , donde ambas partes firmaron y aceptaron los términos.  NEWT GINGRICH: BIDEN PUEDE SER PRESIDENTE PERO TRUMP YA ES LÍDER DEL MUNDO LIBRE  El acuerdo se produce tras una serie de victorias legales de Trump y su equipo jurídico, coordinado por el asesor jurídico principal Boris Epshteyn.  La juez federal Tanya Chutkan accedió recientemente a la petición del abogado especial Jack Smith de desestimar su caso contra Trump relacionado con las elecciones de 2020. Smith también desestimó el lunes su apelación en el caso de los registros clasificados, después de que un juez federal desestimara totalmente los cargos en julio, dictaminando que había sido nombrado ilegalmente como abogado especial.  En Nueva York contra Trump, el juez Juan Merchan accedió a la petición de Trumpde presentar una moción para desestimar los cargos derivados del caso del fiscal del distrito de Manhattan, Alvin Bragg, y retiró del calendario la fecha de sentencia del presidente electo.  Trump también ha demandado a CBS News por daños y perjuicios por valor de 10.000 millones de dólares, afirmando que la cadena practicó una ""conducta engañosa"" con el fin de interferir en las elecciones en su entrevista de octubre con el vicepresidente Kamala Harris .

https://noticias.foxnews.com/live-news/new-jersey-drone-mystery-reported-sightings-live-updates-12-14-2024,Fox News,right,Trending,"Los expertos descartan el pánico ""infundado"" a los drones mientras se informa de avistamientos en Nueva Jersey, Nueva York y otros lugares","Los avistamientos de ""drones"" en el noreste desatan un pánico ""infundado"", según un experto  ​  Un repunte de supuestos avistamientos de drones a lo largo de la Costa Este provocó el viernes una oleada de peticiones de investigación por parte de residentes y legisladores estatales, a pesar de que los funcionarios públicos insisten en que las aeronaves en cuestión vuelan, de hecho, legalmente, y un experto en aviación retirado de la autoridad portuaria dice a Fox News Digital que los temores son exagerados.  Las quejas sobre drones empezaron a llover el mes pasado en Nueva Jersey, donde testigos y residentes empezaron a informar de avistamientos de drones en zonas costeras, incluida Cape May, una pintoresca ciudad situada a las afueras de Atlantic City.  Más recientemente, legisladores de Nueva York, Connecticut, Pensilvania y Maryland han informado de nuevos supuestos avistamientos de drones en sus estados de origen, y algunos testigos alegan que las aeronaves en cuestión han sido del ""tamaño de coches"" o se han visto sobrevolando infraestructuras sensibles o en espacio aéreo restringido.  El teniente detective retirado de la policía de la Autoridad Portuaria John Ryan dijo a Fox News Digital en una entrevista el viernes que el repunte de la actividad se debe probablemente a dos cosas.  La primera, dijo, es que los drones son una tecnología en rápida evolución que ha experimentado un auge tanto en su uso recreativo como comercial en EE.UU. en los últimos 10 años. Los datos federales sobre el registro de drones reflejan este fuerte aumento de su uso, que en su mayor parte, si no en su totalidad, es legal. En octubre de este año, había más de 790.000 drones registrados en la Asociación Federal de Aviación (FAA), y casi 400.000 drones comerciales registrados.  Eso es ""sólo para que te hagas una idea"" de la magnitud del número de drones legales que hay en EE.UU., dijo Ryan, cuya extensa carrera policial incluyó el servicio durante una década como comandante de operaciones especiales del servicio de emergencias del aeropuerto internacional John F. Kennedy de Nueva York y, más tarde, como oficial jefe de la Autoridad Portuaria, cuya función incluye la supervisión de todas las instalaciones de transporte, incluidos Kennedy, LaGuardia y todos los demás aeropuertos y puertos de la zona.  El segundo error, según Ryan , es que las personas en cuestión piden ayuda a las autoridades equivocadas.  ""El error que veo que comete la gente es que acude a las agencias equivocadas y hace estas preguntas"", añadió.  La FAA es el organismo federal encargado de registrar los drones y otras aeronaves estadounidenses. También es el encargado de supervisar el uso recreativo y comercial de drones en EE.UU.  ""En Nueva Jersey, han estado preguntando a FBI, han estado preguntando al Departamento de Seguridad Nacional - han estado preguntando a todo el mundo excepto a la gente a la que deberían preguntar"", dijo Ryan.

El presidente Donald J. Trump obtuvo la pluralidad del voto popular y ganó decisivamente el colegio electoral (312 a 226). Esto ha dado a su segunda presidencia una sensación única de autoridad, de hecho, un mandato del pueblo estadounidense.  La regla del presidente Abraham Lincoln de que con sentimiento popular todo es posible y sin sentimiento popular nada es posible se está confirmando justo delante de nosotros.  Según Rasmussen Reports, el 55% de los votantes estadounidenses creían que las elecciones conferían un mandato claro a las políticas del presidente Trump. Sólo el 32% pensaba que no tenía un mandato (el 13% no estaba seguro).  Esto supone un apoyo de casi 2:1 a un mandato para la agenda Trump entre los que ya se han decidido.  NEWT GINGRICH: BIDEN PUEDE SER PRESIDENTE PERO TRUMP YA ES LÍDER DEL MUNDO LIBRE  El hecho es que: El presidente Trump tiene un programa amplio y creativo para reducir el tamaño del gobierno, recortar los impuestos, aumentar el sueldo neto y resolver una serie de problemas de la nación.  El pueblo estadounidense está de acuerdo en que la antorcha ha pasado de un demócrata liberal cognitivamente en declive y cada vez más pasivo al Presidente electo Trump. El Presidente Trump está llenando el vacío con notable rapidez.  Como escribí recientemente, estamos empezando a ver los primeros efectos del apoyo de la opinión pública a la agenda de Trump y el impulso de la aceptación internacional del presidente Trump como presidente de facto. Algunos demócratas están intentando averiguar cómo responder a los tiempos y a la política cambiantes de nuestra época.  El informe de esta semana de que el senador John Fetterman se inscribió en Truth Social y envió su primera verdad fue una primera señal de que algunos demócratas están abiertos a trabajar con la administración Trump . El demócrata de Pensilvania incluso atacó los casos legales contra el presidente Trump como políticos y pidió al presidente Joe Biden que indultara al nuevo presidente electo.  FETTERMAN DENUNCIA LOS CASOS LEGALES CONTRA TRUMP, HUNTER BIDEN EN SU PRIMER POST DE TRUTH SOCIAL: LOS DOS CASOS ERAN UNA MIERDA  Es posible que el senador Fetterman vaya a llenar el vacío dejado por el senador Joe Manchin, que se jubila, como pensador independiente dispuesto a trabajar con ambos partidos.  La incorporación de Elon Musk y Vivek Ramaswamy al equipo orientado al cambio del Presidente Trumpha añadido un nivel de prestigio y energía que resulta transformador. Tener la oportunidad de reunirse con el hombre más rico del mundo e intercambiar ideas con dos empresarios extraordinarios es una auténtica ruptura con el patrón normalmente aburrido de las reuniones a las que asisten los miembros.  Fue alentador cuando CNN informó el 4 de diciembre:  ""El representante demócrata Jared Moskowitz se unió a un grupo de congresistas liderado por los republicanos en apoyo del recién creado Departamento de Eficiencia Gubernamental, o DOGE, del presidente electo Donald Trump , codirigido por Musk y Vivek Ramaswamy. El representante demócrata Ro Khanna ha dicho que colaborará con Musk en determinados asuntos, y Vermont el senador independiente Bernie Sanders publicó recientemente en X que 'Elon Musk tiene razón'"".  El congresista Khanna representa a gran parte del sector innovador de alta tecnología del norte de California. Tiene un sentido real de hasta qué punto las nuevas tecnologías y el espíritu empresarial pueden modernizar el gobierno y reducir su coste. Escribió un artículo entero titulado ""Los demócratas pueden trabajar con el DOGE"" para MSNBC en el que señalaba cómo se podría hacer que el Pentágono fuera menos caro y más eficaz.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA VER MÁS OPINIONES DE FOX NEWS  Estos primeros indicadores de colaboración potencial pueden convertirse en una auténtica mayoría legislativa bipartidista para la agenda del presidente Trump.  La mayoría de los temas sobre los que hizo campaña el presidente Trump tienen entre un 60% y un 80% de aprobación. Con el púlpito intimidatorio de la Casa Blanca y los activistas de base que fueron una clave importante para que el presidente ganara el 5 de noviembre, puede ser positivo emprender una serie de iniciativas legislativas que atraigan los votos demócratas.  Cuando estaba en el Congreso, participé en dos asombrosos ciclos de victorias bipartidistas para temas conservadores populares.  En 1981, como miembro relativamente nuevo, trabajé en el programa trienal de recortes fiscales del presidente Ronald Reagan. Apelando al pueblo estadounidense y explicando cómo el bill mejoraría sus vidas, se desarrolló suficiente presión popular para conseguir que un tercio de los demócratas de la Cámara votaran con nosotros.  En 1996, como Presidente de la Cámara, aprobamos la reforma de la asistencia social bill , que fue la mayor reforma social conservadora de mi vida. Al hacer hincapié en el requisito del trabajo y reorientar las oficinas de asistencia social para que fueran agencias de ayuda al empleo , conseguimos que aumentara el número de niños que salían de la pobreza más que en ningún otro momento de la historia de EEUU. Aunque la izquierda dura odiaba los requisitos laborales, el apoyo popular a la reforma de la asistencia social (cerca del 90% en una encuesta, incluido el 88% de los que recibían asistencia social) hizo que los demócratas se dividieran por la mitad. Ganamos 101 demócratas y perdimos 101 demócratas.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA OBTENER LA APLICACIÓN FOX NEWS  Una conciliación bill que reduzca los impuestos y reforme la normativa para crear empleo -con tres o cuatro meses de comunicación, educación y organización de base- podría hacer que un número considerable de demócratas decidieran que tenían que apoyar la bill o enfrentarse a una derrota segura.  Existe el potencial para un bipartidismo positivo que reforme el establishment y cree una América mucho más dinámica, segura y próspera.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA LEER MÁS DE NEWT GINGRICH",US,
https://noticias.foxnews.com/us/rural-towns-push-divorce-big-cities-form-new-conservative-state,Fox News,right,Trending,Los pueblos rurales presionan para divorciarse de las grandes ciudades y formar un nuevo estado conservador,"Los votantes rurales de California están hartos de la mayoría demócrata de Sacramento y presionan para que sus comunidades se divorcien de las zonas urbanas azules que dominan la política estatal.  Los residentes conservadores de las regiones rurales de California están cansados del exceso de regulación, del elevado coste de la vida y de la miríada de políticas que salen de la Legislatura estatal dominada por los demócratas, dijo Paul Preston, que fundó el Nuevo Estado California con la esperanza de separarse de su sede actual.  ""Reconocimos que estábamos en una tiranía"", dijo Preston a Fox News Digital, citando la disparidad entre demócratas y republicanos en el gobierno estatal.  Preston, antiguo administrador escolar, describió California como un estadode ""partido único"" que funciona de forma similar a un régimen comunista, aprobando leyes que no tienen en cuenta a la clase rural.  GAVIN NEWSOM INTERROGADO POR EL ELEVADO PRECIO DE LA AYUDA 'A PRUEBA DETRUMP' CALIFORNIA: 'DESPILFARRO TOTAL'  Según el mapa propuesto, el nuevo estado de California comprendería casi todos los 58 condados de California, excepto la mayor parte del condado de Los Ángeles y partes del condado de Sacramento , San Francisco y otras partes de la zona de la Bahía. El mapa es puramente una propuesta y no representa las fronteras definitivas del estado, dijo Preston.  Sus partidarios sostienen que dividir California en dos proporcionaría una gobernanza más justa y receptiva a las zonas situadas fuera de las grandes ciudades del estado.  Preston señaló que el estado propuesto tendría frontera con México en un esfuerzo por combatir la inmigración ilegal. Entre sus muchas quejas están los problemas de delincuencia de California, que llevaron a los votantes a destituir al fiscal del distrito de San Francisco en 2022 y a la fiscal del condado de Alameda, Pamela Price, en noviembre. En el condado de Los Ángeles, los votantes destituyeron al fiscal del distrito George Gascon el 5 de noviembre, tras un solo mandato, ya que los críticos le culparon de ser demasiado indulgente con los delincuentes.  Los votantes también aprobaron firmemente la Proposición 36 de mano dura contra la delincuencia el mes pasado, a pesar de los esfuerzos de los demócratas del estado y del gobernador Gavin Newsom por preservar una década de políticas de reforma de la justicia penal que, según los críticos, permitieron a los delincuentes.  ""No creo que nadie vaya a decir a California que estamos libres de invasiones y de violencia doméstica"", dijo Preston, citando la delincuencia y el flujo de inmigrantes ilegales en el estado.  Fox News Digital se ha puesto en contacto con la oficina de Newsom y con el presidente de la Asamblea estatal, el demócrata Robert Rivas. El Partido Demócrata de California dijo que no había nadie disponible para comentar el asunto.  OPINIÓN: LA SENCILLA SOLUCIÓN A LA ""CALIFORNIZACIÓN"" DE LA POLÍTICA ENERGÉTICA ESTADOUNIDENSE  En los últimos años, California ha sido criticada por su elevado coste de la vida, su epidemia de personas sin hogar -a pesar de gastar miles de millones para abordar el problema- y sus indulgentes políticas de justicia penal y de estado santuario que, según los opositores, contribuyen a la delincuencia.  James Gallagher, líder republicano en la Asamblea estatal, dijo que no conocía el esfuerzo del Nuevo Estado California específicamente, pero afirmó: ""Lo entiendo perfectamente"". Sin embargo, Gallagher dijo que la división no es necesariamente urbana frente a rural, sino más bien costera frente a las comunidades del interior.  ""A menudo parece que hay dos estados separados en California,"" dijo a Fox News Digital. ""Esa parte del interior se siente completamente olvidada por Gavin Newsom y la supermayoría demócrata. Todas las políticas que salen de Sacramento no les afectan realmente (a los legisladores demócratas)"".  CALIFORNIA EL ENCLAVE COSTERO CERCANO A LA CIUDAD SANTUARIO INTENTA ""BLINDARSE"" CONTRA NEWSOM  Como ejemplo, Gallagher citó los mandatos sobre vehículos eléctricos dirigidos por California, que exigen que todas las ventas de vehículos nuevos en el estado sean modelos de emisiones cero para 2035, lo que, según él, perjudicaría a muchos residentes rurales.  Tina Hessong, de 55 años, que vive en Yuba City, unos kilómetros al norte de Sacramento, dijo que California es en realidad más conservadora de lo que se hace creer al resto del país. Citó el mapa del Colegio Electoral de las elecciones presidenciales de noviembre.  ""El mapa que ha salido de la reciente votación y lo rojo que es realmente el estado de California , es más representativo de lo que yo creo que es la realidad del estado de California "", declaró a Fox News Digital. ""Somos un estado rojo y los grandes centros azules -Los Ángeles y San Francisco - obtienen toda la representación porque tienen la mayor población"".  Ellen Lee Zhou, que creció en China y se ha presentado como candidata a la alcaldía de San Francisco, dijo que los legisladores demócratas y Newsom habían dado prioridad a los inmigrantes ilegales frente a los residentes legales y habían abandonado todo sentido común.  ""Lo que hemos visto en los últimos 10 años es increíble con los sin techo, el tráfico abierto de drogas y la prostitución"", dijo Zhou a Fox News Digital. ""No puedo explicarme lo que ha ocurrido con los dirigentes"".  A pesar de que el Vicepresidente Kamala Harris ganó el voto popular en todo el estado, con un gran apoyo de las regiones costeras, Trump se llevó la mayoría de los condados, principalmente en las zonas rurales.  LOS MIGRANTES CAPTURADOS EN LA FRONTERA FUERON TRASLADADOS EN AUTOBÚS Y SACADOS EN AVIÓN DE SAN DIEGO EN UN POSIBLE ""ENCUBRIMIENTO"" ANTES DE LAS ELECCIONES: FUNCIONARIO  Tras las elecciones del 5 de noviembre, Newsom visitó California's red counties, donde dijo a los votantes: ""Mensaje recibido"".  ""No me importa a quién hayas votado. Me importa la gente. Me importan los partidarios de Trump , me importan los partidarios de RFK Jr. (Robert Kennedy, Jr.), me importan los partidarios de Tucker Carlson, me importan los partidarios de Charlie Kirk, me importan los partidarios de Ben Shapiro, me importan todas las personas"", dijo durante una de sus paradas.  ""Me preocupan las personas que viven aquí, en las Sierras, la gente de San Diego, donde acabo de estar, o mi patio trasero en Fair Oaks, California"", añadió Newsom.  Trump ha atacado a las ciudades liberales, afirmando que están plagadas de delincuencia, que pagan demasiados impuestos y que se están desmoronando debido a las políticas demócratas centradas en la ideología ""woke"" en lugar de mejorar la calidad de vida de los residentes.  California tiene una larga historia de intentos de dividirse en trozos más pequeños. Desde 1850, cuando se convirtió en el 31º estado admitido en la unión, ha habido más de 220 intentos de bisecarlo, trisecarlo o diseccionarlo en seis estados más pequeños, según la Biblioteca Estatal California .  Más recientemente, el multimillonario capitalista de riesgo de Silicon Valley Tim Draper propuso una iniciativa para dividir California en seis estados, pero la propuesta no logró clasificarse para la votación de 2016.  NEWSOM VETA LA POLÉMICA BILL QUE HABRÍA DADO PRÉSTAMOS PARA VIVIENDA A INMIGRANTES ILEGALES  En 2018, Draper consiguió que se incluyera en la papeleta electoral de 2018 una medida para dividir California en tres estados, después de que el referéndum ""Cal 3"" obtuviera suficientes firmas de votantes. Sin embargo, el Tribunal Supremo del estado decidió el 18 de julio de 2018 retirar la pregunta de la papeleta ""porque se han planteado cuestiones significativas sobre la validez de la proposición"", afirma el sitio web de la biblioteca.  Otros estados también han apoyado algún tipo de esfuerzo sucesorio en el pasado.  En 2020, el gobernador de West Virginia, Jim Justice, dijo que los condados rurales descontentos de la vecina Virginia eran más que bienvenidos a unirse a su estado.  ""Si no eres realmente feliz donde estás, estamos con los brazos abiertos para sacarte de Virginia o de cualquier otro sitio donde puedas estar"", dijo entonces Justice, republicano. ""Defendemos firmemente la Segunda Enmienda y defendemos firmemente a los no nacidos"".  La división rural-urbana forma parte de la política desde hace mucho tiempo. En noviembre, Trump consiguió algunos avances en zonas urbanas, suburbanas y rurales, sorprendiendo a muchos.  CÓMO UN TERREMOTO POLÍTICO SACUDIÓ CALIFORNIA E HIZO QUE LA DELINCUENCIA ""POR FIN VOLVIERA A SER ILEGAL"".  A pesar de su creciente apoyo entre los californianos, Newsom ha convocado una sesión extraordinaria en medio de sus esfuerzos por ""Trump-proteger"" al Estado Dorado de posibles interferencias federales, pero dijo que trabajaría con la administración entrante.  ""Pero cuando haya una extralimitación, cuando se amenace la vida, cuando se atente contra los derechos y las libertades, actuaremos"", dijo. ""Y eso es exactamente de lo que trata esta sesión especial: de preparar a este estado para el éxito, independientemente de quién esté en la Casa Blanca"".  Aunque Preston no prevé una separación inmediata, teniendo en cuenta que el esfuerzo necesitaría la bendición de la Legislatura, cree que se producirá una apertura.  ""Se trata realmente de un debate urbano contra rural"", dijo. ""Nos han recibido muy bien en el Congreso (durante las visitas a Washington), incluso los demócratas. Es interesante que la gente que está empezando a ver lo que hacemos esté a bordo"".  Hawai fue el último estado admitido en la unión en 1959.

Luigi Mangione fue detenido el lunes tras una persecución y acusado del asesinato de Thompson, cometido a la salida de un hotel de Manhattan la semana pasada. Mangione se ha convertido en un héroe popular para algunas figuras de extrema izquierda que creen que la muerte de Thompson es una merecida reacción contra los gigantes de los seguros médicos, como UnitedHealthcare , que deniegan la cobertura o cobran primas elevadas.  La senadora demócrata por Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren condenó el asesinato esta semana, pero dijo que la muerte de Thompson debería servir también de ""advertencia"".  ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta, pero sólo se puede presionar a la gente hasta cierto punto"", declaró a HuffPost. ""Esta es una advertencia de que si presionas a la gente lo suficiente, pierde la fe en la capacidad de su gobierno para hacer cambios, pierde la fe en la capacidad de las personas que proporcionan la asistencia sanitaria para hacer cambios, y empieza a tomar el asunto en sus propias manos de formas que, en última instancia, serán una amenaza para todos"".  ELIZABETH WARREN DICE QUE EL ASESINATO DE UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO FUE UNA ADVERTENCIA: 'SÓLO SE PUEDE PRESIONAR A LA GENTE HASTA CIERTO PUNTO'  Warren hizo comentarios similares a la presentadora de MSNBC Joy Reid sobre el asesinato de Thompson.  ""La gente está muy enfadada por la asistencia sanitaria, creo que con razón, por negar la asistencia y por todo el sistema... matar a un CEO no es la forma de cambiar"", dijo Reid. ""Hay que regularlos"".  ""Lo diremos una y otra vez"", dijo Warren. ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta. Se juzga a este tipo que supuestamente ha matado al CEO de UnitedHealth[care], pero sólo se puede presionar a la gente hasta cierto punto, y entonces empiezan a tomarse la justicia por su mano.""  Warren se retractó más tarde de sus comentarios a Fox News Digital.  ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta. Punto"", dijo. ""Debería haber sido mucho más clara al decir que nunca hay justificación para el asesinato"".  El periodista Piers Morgan también se enfrentó a la periodista de izquierdas Taylor Lorenz por su aparente simpatía hacia Mangione durante un episodio de ""Piers Morgan Uncensored"" emitido el lunes por la noche. Durante el programa, Lorenz admitió que sentía ""alegría"" por la muerte de Thompson.  Cuando un escandalizado Morgan se enfrentó a Lorenz por sus comentarios, diciendo que Thompson es ""marido y padre"", Lorenz replicó: ""¡También lo son las decenas de miles de estadounidenses que asesinó! También lo son las decenas de miles de estadounidenses, estadounidenses inocentes, que murieron porque ejecutivos codiciosos de seguros sanitarios como éste impulsan una política de negar la asistencia a las personas más vulnerables.""  Más tarde dijo que nunca sintió ""alegría por la muerte de ese hombre"", sino porque más gente está prestando atención a los problemas sistémicos de la sanidad estadounidense.  La copresentadora de ""The View"" Sunny Hostin leyó comentarios la semana pasada burlándose de la muerte de Thompson en las redes sociales, diciendo que la celebración de parte del público estadounidense es ""reflejo de cómo se siente la gente respecto a su asistencia sanitaria"". En un momento dado dijo: ""¿No es algo?"".  EX REPORTERO DE LA WAPO DICE 'QUEREMOS A ESTOS EJECUTIVOS MUERTOS' TRAS EL ASESINATO DE LA ASEGURADORA CEO  ""Nuestro país es uno de los únicos que no tiene asistencia sanitaria universal, y no cuidamos de nuestros ancianos y la gente está sintiendo el pellizco"", dijo Hostin. ""Hablamos de ello todo el tiempo y creo que la gente está realmente enfadada con el sistema sanitario y, por desgracia, se está trasladando a este padre"".  La diputada Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, demócrata de Nueva York, también se ha pronunciado tras el asesinato de Thompson, afirmando que la violencia no estaba ""justificada"", pero que la gente considera la denegación del seguro médico como un acto propio de agresión.  ""Esto no quiere decir que un acto de violencia esté justificado, pero creo que para cualquiera que esté confundido o conmocionado o consternado, tiene que entender que la gente interpreta y siente y experimenta las reivindicaciones denegadas como un acto de violencia contra ellos"", declaró esta semana.

UNITED HEALTHCARE CEO EL SOSPECHOSO DE ASESINATO LUIGI MANGIONE SE QUEJÓ DE UNA OPERACIÓN DE ESPALDA ANTES DEL ASESINATO  EX REPORTERO DE LA WAPO DICE 'QUEREMOS A ESTOS EJECUTIVOS MUERTOS' TRAS EL ASESINATO DEL SEGURO CEO  ""Ninguno de los dos tuvo una relación significativa con una mujer"", dijo Kelly. ""Ambos podrían haber sufrido esquizofrenia. Seguro que el Unabomber sí. Luigi está en la edad madura en la que podría empezar"".  Kaczynski se suicidó en prisión el año pasado tras renunciar a someterse a tratamientos contra el cáncer. Cumplía cadena perpetua sin posibilidad de libertad condicional después de que su hermano leyera su manifiesto, enviado anónimamente al Washington Post en 1995 y lo delatara.  Al parecer, Mangione tenía un manifiesto escrito a mano cuando la policía de Altoona, Pensilvania, lo detuvo el lunes. En el manifiesto, supuestamente mencionaba UnitedHealthcare y la conferencia de accionistas a la que Thompson se dirigía en el momento del asesinato.  ""Ambos estaban obsesionados y centrados en industrias a las que querían hacer daño y concienciar a la opinión pública"", dijo Kelly.  SIGUE AL EQUIPO DE FOX TRUE CRIME EN X  Mangione aparecía periódicamente en Goodreads, la red social dedicada a la literatura, donde escribió una reseña de manifiesto de Kaczynski .  ""Es fácil tacharlo rápida e irreflexivamente (sic) de manifiesto de un lunático, para evitar enfrentarse a algunos de los incómodos problemas que identifica"", escribió. ""Pero es sencillamente imposible ignorar lo clarividentes que resultaron muchas de sus predicciones sobre la sociedad moderna"".  Escribiendo sobre ""La sociedad industrial y su futuro"" de Kaczynski, citó otra ""toma online que [le] pareció interesante"".  ""Cuando todas las demás formas de comunicación fracasan, la violencia es necesaria para sobrevivir"", escribió. ""Puede que no te gusten sus métodos, pero viendo las cosas desde su perspectiva, no es terrorismo, es guerra y revolución"".  UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO EL ATAQUE ""PREMEDITADO"" DE BRIAN THOMPSON Y LA HUIDA DEL SOSPECHOSO: CRONOLOGÍA  Elogió al terrorista en serie lobo solitario como un ""prodigio de las matemáticas"".  INSCRÍBETE PARA RECIBIR BOLETÍN DE TRUE CRIME  ""Era un individuo violento -justamente encarcelado- que mutilaba a personas inocentes"", escribió. ""Aunque estas acciones tienden a caracterizarse como las de un loco ludita (sic), sin embargo, se ven más exactamente como las de un revolucionario político extremo"".  Ambos hombres se habían recluido antes de sus presuntos crímenes. Kaczynski se mudó a una cabaña remota sin electricidad ni agua corriente para alejarse de la sociedad cada vez más tecnologizada que odiaba. La madre de Mangione denunció su desaparición a la policía de San Francisco el mes pasado, diciéndoles que no había podido ponerse en contacto con su hijo desde julio, según fuentes policiales.  La dirección de la empresa donde creía que trabajaba estaba permanentemente cerrada.  LA POLICÍA DE NUEVA YORK ENCUENTRA COINCIDENCIAS ENTRE EL ARMA Y LAS HUELLAS DACTILARES EN EL ASESINATO DE UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO , SEGÚN EL COMISARIO  ""Se convierte en un recluso"", dijo Nicole Parker, ex agente deFBI . ""Es entonces cuando realmente empieza a definir cómo va a ser. Eso es probablemente lo que le hizo empezar a recorrer este camino hacia la violencia. Pero no te engañes pensando que este chico nunca antes pensó así"".  Pero puso en duda que el presunto asesino actuara realmente solo.  ""Quiero ver el historial de llamadas de ese teléfono desechable"", dijo a Fox News Digital. ""Esos sentimientos no empezaron ayer ni hace tres meses. ¿Esos pensamientos internos que tenía? No"".  Al igual que Mangione, Kaczynski era un antiguo miembro de la Ivy Leaguer: licenciado en Harvard y matemático. El Unabomber mató a tres personas e hirió a 23 más entre 1978 y 1995 con una serie de bombas que envió por correo a sus víctimas.  MIRA 'ESCANDALOSO: UNABOMBER' EN FOX NATION  Un vídeo de vigilancia grabado en el exterior de un hotel Hilton del centro de Manhattan muestra a un asesino enmascarado acercándose sigilosamente por detrás a Thompson en la acera hacia las 6.45 horas del 4 de diciembre. Thompson se dirigía a una conferencia de accionistas en el establecimiento que iba a comenzar esa misma mañana, cuando el pistolero abrió fuego por la espalda.  Cuando el CEO se desplomó en la calle, una mujer que presenció el ataque huyó en una dirección y la figura enmascarada se alejó despreocupadamente en la otra. La policía siguió sus movimientos por toda Nueva York hasta una estación de autobuses, de donde salió una hora después del asesinato. Compartieron imágenes de vigilancia, que circularon ampliamente por Internet, y la policía lo detuvo el lunes en un McDonald's de Altoona, Pensilvania, después de que unos testigos lo reconocieran y llamaran al 911.

Su abogado dijo esta semana a un juez que piensa luchar contra la extradición a Nueva York, lo que retrasaría allí un caso de asesinato en segundo grado.  La policía dijo a Fox News que estaban investigando si se le había denegado una reclamación de asistencia sanitaria mientras investigan un posible motivo.

El libro no aparecía en su cuenta de Goodreads. La policía dijo el miércoles que los casquillos coincidían balísticamente con la pistola incautada durante la detención de Mangione.  ""Sentía simpatía por un individuo, y tenía una causa y supuestamente utilizó la violencia por esa causa"", dijo Parker. ""Se tarda mucho tiempo en desarrollar estos pensamientos. Este tirador tenía la inteligencia y la sofisticación para hacerlo, [una] personalidad de rasgos de alguien dispuesto a llegar a medidas extremas por algo que le apasiona.

Escribiendo en su página de Substack el viernes, Moore señaló que no aprueba el asesinato, pero insistió en que la rabia que la gente siente hacia la industria debería amplificarse tras el asesinato de UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.  ""El enfado está justificado al 1000%. Hace tiempo que los medios de comunicación deberían haberlo cubierto. No es algo nuevo. Ha estado hirviendo.

El tiroteo provocó una oleada de condena y horror por la matanza, pero también de celebración entre algunos que optaron por la simpatía hacia los estadounidenses que consideran víctimas del sistema sanitario del país.  El artículo de Moore indicaba que estaba en este último bando.  ""En su manifiesto, hace referencia a cómo he 'iluminado la corrupción y la codicia', dando a entender que la gente debería acudir a mi trabajo para comprender la complejidad -y el abuso hambriento de poder- de nuestro sistema actual"", escribió Moore, añadiendo que, desde que se le menciona en el manifiesto del sospechoso, le preguntan constantemente si condena el asesinato de Thompson.  CÓMO EL ARMA DEL PISTOLERO DE UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO PODRÍA JUGAR EN SU CONTRA Y A FAVOR DE LA POLICÍA  ""Hmmm. ¿Condeno el asesinato? Es una pregunta extraña"", escribió. ""En Fahrenheit 9/11, condené el asesinato de cientos de miles de iraquíes inocentes y el asesinato sin sentido de nuestros propios soldados estadounidenses a manos de nuestro gobierno estadounidense"".  Y añadió: ""En mis 35 años como cineasta, ¿he dicho o hecho algo que haya implicado que apruebo el asesinato?"".  Sin embargo, Moore optó por centrar su condena en las empresas sanitarias, afirmando: ""He aquí una triste estadística para ti: En Estados Unidos, tenemos la friolera de 1,4 millones de personas empleadas con el trabajo de NEGAR LA ATENCIÓN SANITARIA, ¡frente a sólo 1 millón de médicos en todo el país!""

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-rookie-xavier-worthy-calls-dream-come-true-having-patrick-mahomes-his-quarterback,Fox News,right,Politics,Chiefs rookie Xavier Worthy calls it 'dream come true' having Patrick Mahomes as his quarterback,"Every rookie entering the NFL wishes to make an immediate impact on their team, especially first-round picks who carry loads of expectation when they hear their names called by Commissioner Roger Goodell on Draft night.  After breaking the 40-yard dash record at the NFL Scouting Combine, Xavier Worthy raised his draft stock, entering that zone of being a potential first-round pick.  All offseason, the Kansas City Chiefs were among teams looking for another playmaker to work with Patrick Mahomes on offense. With the 28th overall pick in hand, Worthy was still available, and they wasted no time adding his speed to the roster.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  While being over the moon that he was selected in the first round, Worthy quickly realized he had a two-time MVP, three-time Super Bowl champion and six-time Pro Bowl quarterback that would be throwing him the football.  One can guess how he feels about that after 13 games and a 12-1 record.  ""It’s kinda like a dream come true,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital ahead of Week 15.  CHIEFS ROOKIE XAVIER WORTHY SAYS TEAM THRIVES PLAYING IN VILLAIN ROLE: ‘EVERYBODY JUST WANTS US TO LOSE’  Worthy understood there was no time to geek out over Mahomes being his new signal caller. It was time to get to work, and he quickly realized that all the winning that comes with being a Chief is business at the end of the day.  ""You see why they win when you’re here,"" Worthy explained. ""They work hard, they go about their business the right way. They have the slogan called ‘The Formula’ – I feel like Coach Reid has hit [on] that in an interview. They really go about that every day, and I feel like it says a lot about the program.""  Of course, Worthy was not guaranteed to slot right in and get working with Mahomes immediately. First, he had to learn the playbook and then develop chemistry with his new quarterback on the practice field and in games.  Well, his first touch of his career, Worthy took an end-around flip from Mahomes to the house for a 21-yard rushing touchdown against the Baltimore Ravens.  Since then, Worthy has totaled 38 receptions on 67 targets for 448 yards with four touchdowns through the air, as well as 54 rushing yards and two touchdowns on the ground.  He feels the trust a quarterback needs in his receiver is there, leading to some pretty good first-year numbers.  ""Pat, he’s more of a guy that’s like, if you show you can go out there and do it, and he trusts you, and you earn his trust, he’s going to trust you throughout the season,"" Worthy said about Mahomes. ""I feel like I’ve earned his trust, and I feel like we’ve got something good rolling.""  A prime example of that came in the latest close-game victory for the Chiefs, which required Mahomes to orchestrate another game-winning drive.  On fourth-and-6 with the game on the line, Mahomes was scrambling around the pocket as the Los Angeles Chargers' pass rush was barreling through his offensive line, looking for a receiver to give him a chance to extend the drive.  Mahomes could have looked to Travis Kelce, DeAndre Hopkins or other veteran options if he wished. However, knowing where Worthy was going to be, he released the ball just as he turned around to look at his quarterback. Worthy ran back to the ball, secured it and kept the team's chances of winning alive.  Job well done, even if there was some pain involved.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play. I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video,"" Worthy said. ""But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  The stacked wins have resulted in what every rookie wants: playoff football.  Worthy gets that as the Chiefs secured the AFC West title for the ninth straight season after beating the Chargers, and the rookie is excited to continue developing that relationship with Mahomes to hopefully help their case for a third straight Super Bowl victory.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  That is exactly what happened with this year's DICK’S Holiday Shopping Sprint, where two lucky winners – Tanisha and her 8-year-old son, AJ, as well as Molly from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City – curated a $2,500 holiday wish list that Worthy collected with his record-breaking speed and brought to them personally.  ""It was fun,"" he said of the experience. ""It was always something I wanted to do just to give back to the community where I’m at, and it was just fun to see the reactions on the kids’ faces. It brightened my day.""",US,0.9994

The lawsuit accused Jay-Z and Diddy of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000, Fox News Digital previously confirmed. Before Jay-Z was named, the rapper received a demand letter likely in an attempt to settle.  ""Things have escalated,"" Orange County criminal defense lawyer Lauren Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital, as the back-and-forth between Jay-Z's legal team and Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee now plays out in the public eye.  JAY-Z'S ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT: CAN RAP MOGUL FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES?  Fox News Digital looks back at the timeline leading to Jay-Z being named in the bombshell lawsuit:  Diddy accused of raping 13-year-old girl  Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was first accused of raping a 13-year-old while celebrities watched in October. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York on Oct. 20 by Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee on behalf of a Jane Doe.  The unidentified woman ended up at a VMAs afterparty after attempting to gain entry to the awards show at Radio City Music Hall, according to court documents.  ""One of the limousine drivers she spoke to claimed to work for [Diddy],"" the lawsuit read. ""He told her that Combs liked younger girls and said she ‘fit what Diddy was looking for,’ not allowing her into the Awards, but inviting her to an afterparty.""  The girl claimed after being given one drink, she found a room to lie down in because she became ""woozy and lightheaded."" At one point, Combs and two unidentified celebrities entered the room. ""Celebrity A"" allegedly raped the 13-year-old while Combs and ""Celebrity B"" watched. Afterwards, the young girl claimed Combs raped her while ""Celebrity A"" and ""Celebrity B"" watched.  Diddy denied the allegations in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.  WATCH ON FOX NATION: WHAT DIDDY DO?  Jay-Z receives a demand letter regarding the sexual assault lawsuit against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs  At some point, Jay-Z received a demand letter from the anonymous accuser's lawyer – unbeknownst to the public. Jay-Z confirmed this information in his statement denying the rape accusation.  ""My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a ‘lawyer’ named Tony Buzbee ,"" Jay-Z shared in the statement on Roc Nation's social media. ""What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.  ""No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!""  ""Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes."" — Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot  The decision to eventually publicly name Jay-Z was likely due to ""a failure to settle the case,"" a legal expert told Fox News Digital.  ""Jay-Z may have decided that settling the case would suggest to the public that he was somehow involved in the sexual assault of a minor,"" Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot, explained. ""After receiving a demand letter, Jay-Z and his legal team probably pushed back against the Plaintiff's accusations and may have tried to convince her counsel to not proceed with naming him as a Defendant.  ""The Plaintiff's attorney probably made a decision to proceed against Jay-Z after it became apparent that they would not settle the case. Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes.""  Jay-Z files lawsuit claiming extortion under ‘John Doe’  Before Jay-Z was named publicly in the lawsuit accusing him and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of rape, he sued his accuser's lawyer as a celebrity John Doe.  WATCH: JAY-Z ISSUES SCATHING DENIAL TO ALLEGATIONS HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL  On Nov. 18, his lawyers filed a lawsuit against Buzbee. Since then, Jay-Z confirmed he was the plaintiff in the anonymous lawsuit.  ""Plaintiff presently faces a gun to his head,"" the court document, obtained by Fox News Digital, read. Jay-Z's team claimed Buzbee and the anonymous accuser had demanded the rapper ""either repeatedly pay an exorbitant sum of money to stop Defendants from the wide publication of wildly false allegations of sexual assault that would subject [Jay-Z] to opprobrium and irreparably harm [Jay-Z's] reputation, family, career and livelihood, or else face the threat of an untold number of civil suits and financial and personal ruin.""  While Jay-Z accused Buzbee of extortion, legal experts claimed demand letters are typical in these types of cases.  ""It is standard for these types of letters to be sent before filing a case or including a defendant in a case,"" Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital. ""If a case can settle outside of court, that usually benefits everyone involved. It is not extortion, but it can feel like it to the defendant, especially if the ask is high.""  DeGroot added: ""The tone of these letters may vary. Given the high profile nature of Jay-Z, and having a sense that it would be leaked to the press, Mr. Buzbee is starting his litigation spin as early as possible to get the attention of Jay-Z and to influence potential jurors.""

In the new version of the lawsuit, the 13-year-old became disoriented and found a bedroom to rest in after allegedly consuming one drink. Jay-Z, Diddy and female ""Celebrity B"" seemingly followed the girl into the room. She ""immediately recognized all three celebrities,"" according to the court document.  Jay-Z allegedly raped the girl, followed by Diddy's alleged rape of the plaintiff, all while ""celebrity B"" watched, the court document stated.

Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree? These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case,"" he wrote, in part.  ""Celebrity B"" remains unnamed, but will likely be revealed at some point in the process, according to a legal expert.  ""Since that person's participation appears to be that of a witness, her status is entirely different, unless there is a legal reason,"" DeGroot told Fox News Digital.

Belichick sat in front of the media during his introductory press conference as the new head coach for the Tar Heels – an idea no college football fan would've fathomed until rumors began to swirl last week about his interest in running the program.  It was always thought that Belichick, who is 27 wins away from becoming the head coach with the most victories in NFL history, would return to the pros if he wished to continue coaching.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  But the 72-year-old explained on Thursday afternoon why he chose to go the college route.  ""​​I’ve always wanted to coach in college football,"" Belichick said. ""It just never really worked out. Had some good years in the NFL, so that was OK. But this is really a dream come true.""  BILL BELICHICK AGREES TO BECOME UNC'S NEXT HEAD FOOTBALL COACH  Belichick is obviously being modest by saying his time in the NFL was just ""good.""  Before the Kansas City Chiefs, he developed the New England Patriots into a dynasty, winning six Super Bowls and racking up wins that brought about the argument of greatest NFL head coach of all time.  College football, though, is a completely different beast, especially in this new NIL world. But these aren't waters Belichick just wants to dip his toes in – he's diving straight in and not looking to get out.  ""I didn't come here to leave,"" he said, dispelling thoughts for now that he's just trying to coach again before that next NFL opportunity opens up.  Belichick did say that, while the process may be different, the pros and college do have ""a lot of parallels."" It's why Michael Lombardi is coming in as the team's general manager, someone who knows how Belichick functions given their time together in New England.  ""I think that's the reason for the general structure with Michael as the general manager and myself as the coach and working collaboratively as we have done in a professional structure,"" Belichick explained.  For this big leap to be successful, Belichick knows he just needs to take things one day at a time. That starts with putting together his coaching staff, which he has already touched on with Freddie Kitchens coming aboard. More announcements should be made in the coming weeks.  Recruiting, not drafting, will also be interesting to watch with Belichick, but reports have indicated his wish for UNC to have the proper NIL resources to land top talent to make the program competitive.  As someone who was around the program as a kid – his father, Steve Belichick, coached with the Tar Heels in the 1950s – he understands what it means to be successful in Chapel Hill.

Wallen was charged with two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment, according to Fox 17. Judge Cynthia Chappell sentenced the country music star to seven days at a DUI education center along with two years of supervised probation.  Wallen's charges were reduced from felonies to misdemeanors during a hearing on Tuesday.  MORGAN WALLEN SKIPS FIRST NASHVILLE ARREST COURT HEARING IN ‘VERY COMPLICATED’ CASE  ""Earlier today (12/12/24), Morgan Wallen appeared in Davidson County Circuit Court with Judge Cynthia Chappell presiding where he entered a conditional plea pursuant to Tennessee’s Diversion Statute that does not result in a conviction,"" Robinson said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.

Upon the successful completion of his probation, the charges will be eligible for dismissal and expungement.  ""Mr. Wallen has cooperated fully with authorities throughout these last eight months, directly communicating and apologizing to all involved.

""Morgan's doing well,"" Robinson said of the ""Last Night"" singer amid the legal drama. ""He's very busy, which is good. He's a family man, and I think this concert is especially special for him because his family lives close.""  ""I think those are the best times of his life,"" he explained.

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-rookie-xavier-worthy-says-team-thrives-playing-villain-role-everybody-just-wants-us-lose,Fox News,right,Politics,Chiefs rookie Xavier Worthy says team thrives playing in villain role: 'Everybody just wants us to lose',"Kansas City Chiefs rookie receiver Xavier Worthy knows it is his job at the end of the day, but he is having a lot of fun playing with his team each week.  How could he not be happy when he is 12-1 to start off his first season in the NFL. Not many rookies get that luxury.  However, the first-round pick learned quickly what comes with the territory of being a team in search of three Super Bowls – playing the villain role.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Worthy, who broke the NFL Scouting Combine 40-yard dash record back in April, said he hears the outside noise, especially those wanting the Chiefs to lose each week.  ""I feel like everybody just wants us to lose,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital after highlighting the fun he had with the DICKS Holiday Shopping Sprint to impact kids in the Kansas City area for the holidays.  CHIEFS' ALTERNATE REALITY: KANSAS CITY WOULD BE 2011 IF THEIR ONE-SCORE GAME RESULTS WERE FLIPPED IN 2024  ""Every week, it’s a new excuse. First, the goal post is helping us. Then, it’s the refs helping us. I mean, we can’t get a break. But it’s cool to have that. It shows that everybody wants us to lose, we have a target on our backs, and we have to continue working each and every week.""  The Chiefs are a dynasty, and Worthy entered the fray right after they defeated the San Francisco 49ers in overtime to collect back-to-back Vince Lombardi trophies.  Just ask any other dynasty in the NFL what happens when they are on top. Fans will raise them up and ultimately want to watch them fall with a new winner crowned.  However, Worthy brings up a reason why some fans cannot stand to watch the Chiefs stack wins. They have been in so many close games this season, but they have maintained their winning streak in those one-score bouts.  For the last 15 games that have been determined by one score, the Chiefs have come out victorious. Yes, the goal post was involved this past week as Matthew Wright doinked it off the left side, but it went through to beat the Los Angeles Chargers. Additionally, there have been some controversial calls that have gone the Chiefs' way in the end.  Being the villain, though, is not something the Chiefs care about. They embrace it, and Worthy is just getting a taste of what Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and other veterans on the team have been feeling since last season.  ""It fuels us,"" Worthy explained. ""A lot of people say it’s hate, like, ‘Oh, people are always going against us.’ But how we look at it, the world’s watching us. You have all these eyes – you make the best of the opportunity with all these eyes on you.""  Worthy is no stranger to having a target on his back after playing for a large college program like the Texas Longhorns.  CHIEFS ARE KINGS OF CLOSING OUT GAMES, AND WHAT ELSE WE LEARNED IN WEEK 14  However, he touched on the senior leadership that helps guide the pact, especially Mahomes, who he continues to build a rapport with each week.  The proof is in the game tape, as Mahomes, scrambling on fourth-and-6 to continue the team's game-winning drive, threw a pass to Worthy with the game on the line, and he came back to the ball, secured it and kept the drive alive.  He even injured himself on the play, but his quarterback trusted him with the game on the line. A little pain is worth it in that case.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play,"" he said. ""I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video. But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  With four games remaining and the AFC West title locked up for the ninth straight season, Worthy knows he will also be a rookie that enjoys playoff football at the end of the regular season.  He is also well aware that the target will be even larger with the Chiefs looking to become the first team ever to win three straight Super Bowls.  If Kansas City has to be the villain to do so, then that is perfectly fine for Worthy, who is solely focused on being the team's hero when it is his turn to make a play.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.  That is exactly what happened with this year's DICK’S Holiday Shopping Sprint, where two lucky winners – Tanisha and her 8-year-old son, AJ, as well as Molly from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City – curated a $2,500 holiday wish list that Worthy collected with his record-breaking speed and brought to them personally.  ""It was fun,"" he said of the experience. ""It was always something I wanted to do just to give back to the community where I’m at, and it was just fun to see the reactions on the kids’ faces. It brightened my day.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Worth took pictures, had some catches and enjoyed the opportunity to make these kids and their families smile.  ""Surprising our athletes with gifts off their list was such a delight,"" said Melissa Christian, vice president of global brand and category marketing at DICK’S Sporting Goods. ""This was another way we could meet our athletes where they are – literally! – and to do to it in record time by having Xavier Worthy, who is known for his speed, shop and deliver to doorsteps was even more fun. He was the perfect partner for this year’s Holiday Shopping Sprint.""  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",US,0.9997

Shawn Carter, known professionally as Jay-Z, and his legal team filed a letter Monday requesting the woman accusing the rapper of raping her when she was 13 years old be identified, Fox News Digital previously confirmed. The woman's lawyer responded, claiming the letter was used as a pretext to submit ""press releases"" disguised as legal filings.  ""It appears defendant Carter made that separate filing, which we believe to be procedurally improper and substantively deficient, to serve as the pretext for defense counsel to submit two ‘letter briefs’ to the Court on December 9 and 10,"" Buzbee wrote in a letter filed Dec. 10, which was obtained by Fox News Digital.

""Except for one sentence requesting an expedited hearing, the ‘letter briefs’ have absolutely nothing to do with the only pending issue before the Court — namely, whether my client should be allowed to continue to proceed anonymously,"" he added.  ""The letters’ otherwise irrelevant contentions that the amended complaint’s allegations are ‘inflammatory’ and ‘frivolous,’ as against counsel’s plea that ‘Mr. Carter is entirely innocent,’ are merely press releases dressed as legal filings.""  Jay-Z was named as a defendant in an amended complaint accusing the rapper, along with friend Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, of raping a young girl at a VMAs afterparty in 2000, Fox News Digital confirmed. The lawsuit, initially filed in October, was refiled Sunday in New York by an anonymous accuser.  The ""Empire State of Mind"" rapper denied the allegations in a statement shared on a Roc Nation social media account.  ""My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a ‘lawyer’ named Tony Buzbee ,"" Jay-Z shared in the statement. ""What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.  ""No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!  ""These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!!

""One of the limousine drivers she spoke to claimed to work for [Diddy],"" the lawsuit states. ""He told her that Combs liked younger girls and said she ‘fit what Diddy was looking for,’ not allowing her into the Awards, but inviting her to an afterparty.""

Jay-Z allegedly raped the girl, followed by Diddy's alleged rape of the plaintiff, all while ""celebrity B"" watched, the court document stated.  Jay-Z's legal team filed to have the lawsuit dismissed Dec. 9, one day after the amended complaint was filed.  In a statement provided to Fox News Digital, Diddy's reps once again denied the allegations.  ""This amended complaint and the recent extortion lawsuit against Mr. Buzbee exposes his barrage of lawsuits against Mr. Combs for what they are: shameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs,"" the statement said.

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bill-belichick-unc-head-football-coach,Fox News,right,Politics,Bill Belichick agrees to become UNC's next head football coach,"Look out Chapel Hill, Bill Belichick is coming.  Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels finalized a deal for the 72-year-old to become their next head football coach, the university officially announced on Wednesday night.  ""I am excited for the opportunity at UNC-Chapel Hill. I grew up around college football with my Dad and treasured those times,"" Belichick wrote in a statement. ""I have always wanted to coach in college and now I look forward to building the football program in Chapel Hill.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  OutKick's Trey Wallace reports that UNC will give Belichick a five-year deal worth upwards of $50 million.  The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach remained interested in returning to the sidelines at some point in the future, but it was always expected that he would make his way back to the NFL after missing out on a new gig following his departure from the New England Patriots before this season. After all, Belichick had been in the league in some role since 1975 prior to this season.  But earlier this week, The Guardian US reported that Belichick agreed to become the new head coach in Chapel Hill, adding that Belichick handed the school a 400 page ""organizational bible"" with structure, payment plans, staffing choices etc.  Wallace reports one of the biggest components to the deal was Belichick having enough NIL money to compete in the recruiting space, which was agreed to. He also wanted to pick his assistant coaches, and UNC is giving them the resources to get who he wants, even if buyouts are necessary.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Among those assistants expected to join the staff is Stephen Belichick, his son who serves as Washington's defensive coordinator. It was reported that the elder Belichick had the unusual request of wanting his son to become his successor, stepping in when he decides to leave the program.  This will mark Belichick's first stint as a college football coach. His father, Steve Belichick, was a longtime assistant coach at Navy. But he did have a stint in the 1950s with the Tar Heels.  Belichick has spent much of the ongoing NFL season in the media spotlight after his interviews for NFL jobs didn't lead to a job offer.  While he interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons in January, the franchise opted against extending an offer. Belichick did not appear to draw much interest from any other NFL team, but his regular appearances on ESPN's ""ManningCast"" and the CW's ""Inside the NFL"" have kept him close to football.  During an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" earlier this week, Belichick confirmed he had talks with UNC about their head coaching vacancy, adding that he spent the 11 months since his departure from the Patriots taking a ""longer look"" at college football throughout the season as opposed to during the spring lead-up to the draft as a pro coach.  ""So it’s been, it’s been a good year for me. I’ve learned a lot,"" Belichick said. ""So, I’ve had the opportunity to talk to Chancellor [Lee] Roberts, and we’ve had a couple of good conversations. So we’ll see how it goes.""  Belichick opted not to go into more detail when asked by McAfee. Instead, Belichick offered a quip about his reputation for giving terse responses during news conferences with the Patriots.  ""Yeah, let’s just leave it at that, Pat,"" Belichick said with a grin. ""I mean, I don’t want to give out too much information. I want to get my press conference aura back.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Belichick shared some details about the makeup of a college program if he were a head coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" he said. ""It would be a professional program — training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history. He finished the 2023 season with 333 career wins — which places him in second on the all-time coaches wins list. Don Shula's 347 wins still leads all coaches.",US,0.9967
https://www.foxnews.com/sports/unc-on-board-have-bill-belichick-become-next-head-coach-still-working-out-issues-deal-report,Fox News,right,Politics,"UNC 'on board' to have Bill Belichick become next head coach, still working out issues with deal","Bill Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels are working to close a deal to make him their next head football coach, which would be his first-ever time coaching in college.  However, ESPN reported that ""there are still issues that both sides need to work through.""  The report adds that the ""ball is in Belichick’s court"" as UNC officials are indeed on board with him taking over the program. And there is expected to be a ""resolution"" soon.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  In fact, OutKick's Trey Wallace reports it's come down to just NIL money, which was among the issues that needed to be worked out in the negotiations. If that can be agreed to, an emergency trustee meeting would be called to finalize the deal.  What exactly are the other issues? Well, the potential role of Belichick’s son, Washington Huskies defensive coordinator Stephen Belichick, is one of them.  It was reported by The Guardian that, among the elder Belichick’s stipulations, his son would be named his heir to the head coach role once the 72-year-old moves on, whenever that would be.  ESPN added Belichick’s salary for taking over and more need to be ironed out before a deal can be agreed to.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  It came as a shock when Belichick’s name was floated for the Tar Heels' vacant position after longtime head coach Mack Brown said he wouldn’t return after this season.  Some of Belichick’s ex-pupils, like Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, had some fun on FOX NFL Sunday this past week mimicking their old coach trying to deal with recruiting in this NIL age of college sports.  ""There’s a lot of things he can do, and obviously he’s tremendous, and even showing his personality. But getting out there on the recruiting trail and dealing with all these college kids,"" Brady said on the NFL pregame show. ""’Listen, do you really want to come here?’"" Brady said, acting as Belichick. ""’I mean, we don’t really want you anyway, but I guess you could come, we’ll figure out if you play.’""  But this wasn’t just a publicity stunt. There’s more than just mutual interest in Belichick’s return to coaching in Chapel Hill.  ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Belichick and UNC officials spent five hours discussing a potential deal on Sunday, and in typical Belichick fashion, he wouldn’t divulge any details during his weekly spot on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Monday morning.  He admitted having a ""couple of good conversations"" with Lee Roberts, UNC’s chancellor, and added, ""We’ll see how that goes.""  If a deal goes through, it would be one of the most polarizing head coach hires for a college program in history, as Belichick has only ever been a head coach in the NFL, where he won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots.  FORMER NFL COACH BRUCE ARIANS OFFERS ADVICE TO BILL BELICHICK AS NORTH CAROLINA FOOTBALL COACHING RUMORS SWIRL  His time with the franchise came to an end before this 2024 season. They mutually parted ways and Belichick’s attempts at finding another role elsewhere were all for naught. He has since joined the sports media space, offering his insight to various outlets, including ESPN, but being open to another opportunity in football was always in the cards.  However, it was always expected that such an opportunity would come from the NFL, and there are several head coaching roles already open in the league, making this situation even more surprising.  But Belichick told McAfee and his crew what would happen if he were to become a college football coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" Belichick said. ""It would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Simply put, Belichick would bring to college football the system he knows works in the NFL, aiming for good players to join his team who will one day turn pro with the tools necessary for easy acclimation.  Time will tell if that program will be at UNC, but it appears some boxes need to be checked before a groundbreaking deal crosses the finish line.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  The New York Mets, who already landed Juan Soto on a record-breaking $765 million deal, were reportedly also in the running for Crochet's services next season. The Red Sox, a team with a deep farm system, unloaded four top-15 prospects to get the deal done, per MLB Pipeline.  What the Red Sox get in return is a budding star in their rotation, which needed a stud from the left side. Crochet is also under cheap team control for two years before becoming a free agent in 2027.  YANKEES SIGN ACE PITCHER TO HISTORIC CONTRACT AFTER LOSING JUAN SOTO SWEEPSTAKES: REPORTS  The White Sox made all the wrong MLB history last season with the worst record ever in a single year, but Crochet was a lone bright spot on the roster.  In his first All-Star season, Crochet pitched to a 3.58 ERA over 146 innings with 209 strikeouts and 33 walks.  His swing-and-miss stuff is what the Red Sox hope can be delivered at Fenway Park and beyond this season as a top-line rotation piece.

https://noticias.foxnews.com/media/george-stephanopoulos-abc-apologize-trump-forced-pay-15-million-settle-defamation-suit,Fox News,right,Politics,"George Stephanopoulos y ABC piden disculpas a Trump, se ven obligados a pagar 15 millones de dólares para resolver una demanda por difamación","FIRST ON FOX- ABC News y su principal presentador George Stephanopoulos han llegado a un acuerdo con Donald Trump en su demanda por difamación, por el que la cadena de noticias pagará al presidente electo 15 millones de dólares.  El acuerdo se hizo público el sábado, revelando que las dos partes han llegado a un acuerdo y han evitado un costoso juicio. Según el acuerdo, ABC News pagará 15 millones de dólares como contribución benéfica a una ""fundación y museo presidenciales que serán establecidos por o para el demandante, como los presidentes de los Estados Unidos de América han establecido en el pasado"". Además, la cadena pagará 1 millón de dólares en concepto de honorarios de abogados a Trump.  Stephanopoulos y ABC News también tuvieron que emitir declaraciones de ""arrepentimiento"" como nota del editor al pie de un artículo publicado en Internet el 10 de marzo de 2024, sobre los comentarios realizados a principios de año que llevaron a Trump a presentar la demanda por difamación. La nota dice: ""ABC News y George Stephanopoulos lamentan las declaraciones sobre el presidente Donald J. Trump realizadas durante una entrevista de George Stephanopoulos con el diputado Nancy Mace en el programa This Week de la ABC el 10 de marzo de 2024"".  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, DE ABC NEWS, DIJO INEXACTAMENTE QUE TRUMP FUE DECLARADO ""RESPONSABLE DE VIOLACIÓN"" 10 VECES, DICEN GURÚS JURÍDICOS  ABC News dijo que la cadena estaba ""satisfecha"" de haber concluido el caso.  ""Nos complace que las partes hayan llegado a un acuerdo para desestimar la demanda en los términos de la presentación judicial"", dijo un portavoz de ABC News a Fox News Digital.  Trump presentó una demanda por difamación contra Stephanopoulos después de que éste afirmara que Trump había sido declarado ""responsable de violación"" en una causa civil durante una polémica entrevista con el diputado Nancy Mace, republicano de Carolina del Sur, el pasado mes de marzo.  Tras reproducir un fragmento en el que Mace hablaba de haber sido víctima de una violación, Stephanopoulos le preguntó: ""¿Cómo compaginas tu apoyo a Donald Trump con el testimonio que acabamos de ver?"".  ""Has apoyado a Donald Trump para presidente. Los jueces y dos jurados distintos le han declarado responsable de violación y de difamar a la víctima de esa violación"", dijo Stephanopoulos, en alusión a la victoria legal de la acusadora de Trump , E. Jean Carroll.  Stephanopoulos repitió esa afirmación diez veces durante su rifirrafe con Mace, a pesar de que un jurado determinó realmente que Trump era responsable de ""abuso sexual"", que tiene una definición distinta según la ley de Nueva York.  Después de que el jurado federal declarara a Trump responsable de abuso sexual, pero no de violación, el juez Lewis Kaplan escribió en una sentencia posterior que el hecho de que Carroll no probara la violación ""en el sentido de la Ley Penal de Nueva York no significa que no probara que el Sr. Trump la ""violara"" tal como mucha gente entiende comúnmente la palabra ""violación"""".  FETTERMAN DENUNCIA LOS CASOS LEGALES CONTRA TRUMP, HUNTER BIDEN EN SU PRIMER POST DE TRUTH SOCIAL: LOS DOS CASOS ERAN UNA MIERDA  Al principio, Stephanopoulos se mostró desafiante ante la demanda de Trumpy dijo al presentador de la CBS Stephen Colbert que no se dejaría ""amedrentar para dejar de hacer mi trabajo por una amenaza"".  ""Trump me demandó porque utilicé la palabra 'violación', aunque un juez dijo que eso es de hecho lo que ocurrió. Presentamos una moción de desestimación"", dijo Stephanopoulos.  El acuerdo se alcanzó después de que la juez Lisette M. Reid ordenara el viernes a Trump y Stephanopoulos que prestaran declaración la semana que viene, antes de la fecha límite del 24 de diciembre para que los acusados presentaran una petición de juicio sumario, con el fin de evitar un juicio.  En su demanda contra Stephanopoulos y ABC, Trump estuvo representado por los abogados de Florida Alejandro Brito y Richard Klugh. El acuerdo con ABC se presentó ante el Tribunal Federal del Distrito Sur de Florida , donde ambas partes firmaron y aceptaron los términos.  NEWT GINGRICH: BIDEN PUEDE SER PRESIDENTE PERO TRUMP YA ES LÍDER DEL MUNDO LIBRE  El acuerdo se produce tras una serie de victorias legales de Trump y su equipo jurídico, coordinado por el asesor jurídico principal Boris Epshteyn.  La juez federal Tanya Chutkan accedió recientemente a la petición del abogado especial Jack Smith de desestimar su caso contra Trump relacionado con las elecciones de 2020. Smith también desestimó el lunes su apelación en el caso de los registros clasificados, después de que un juez federal desestimara totalmente los cargos en julio, dictaminando que había sido nombrado ilegalmente como abogado especial.  En Nueva York contra Trump, el juez Juan Merchan accedió a la petición de Trumpde presentar una moción para desestimar los cargos derivados del caso del fiscal del distrito de Manhattan, Alvin Bragg, y retiró del calendario la fecha de sentencia del presidente electo.  Trump también ha demandado a CBS News por daños y perjuicios por valor de 10.000 millones de dólares, afirmando que la cadena practicó una ""conducta engañosa"" con el fin de interferir en las elecciones en su entrevista de octubre con el vicepresidente Kamala Harris .

Trump asistió al partido anual de rivalidad durante toda su presidencia, por primera vez en 2016, poco después de ganar las elecciones de ese año. También asistió al partido durante todos los años de su presidencia, incluso en 2020 en West Point.  El sábado asistió por sexta vez al partido desde 2016 y por primera vez desde 2020. A lo largo de su presidencia, estuvo en el campo para los actos previos al partido, incluido el lanzamiento de la moneda.  Por primera vez, ambos programas llegaron al partido con 19 victorias combinadas (el Ejército tiene 11-1, mientras que la Armada tiene 8-3).

Podía haberse enfrentado hasta a 15 años de prisión si se le declaraba culpable del cargo más grave, pero al final fue declarado inocente por un jurado que consideró que actuó para defender a sus compañeros del metro cuando sometió a Neely a un estrangulamiento mortal. Asistió como invitado de Vance.  Como el Ejército juega esta temporada en la Conferencia Atlética Americana, ambos equipos han pasado tiempo en el Top 25. Éste será su primer enfrentamiento esta temporada y será un partido no perteneciente a la conferencia.  Aparte del derecho a presumir de sus respectivas academias militares, el partido de este año marca la primera vez desde 2017 que el ganador tendrá la oportunidad de conseguir el Trofeo del Comandante en Jefe, gracias a las victorias del Ejército y la Armada sobre las Fuerzas Aéreas esta temporada.

https://noticias.foxnews.com/live-news/new-jersey-drone-mystery-reported-sightings-live-updates-12-14-2024,Fox News,right,Politics,"Los expertos descartan el pánico ""infundado"" a los drones mientras se informa de avistamientos en Nueva Jersey, Nueva York y otros lugares","Los avistamientos de ""drones"" en el noreste desatan un pánico ""infundado"", según un experto  ​  Un repunte de supuestos avistamientos de drones a lo largo de la Costa Este provocó el viernes una oleada de peticiones de investigación por parte de residentes y legisladores estatales, a pesar de que los funcionarios públicos insisten en que las aeronaves en cuestión vuelan, de hecho, legalmente, y un experto en aviación retirado de la autoridad portuaria dice a Fox News Digital que los temores son exagerados.  Las quejas sobre drones empezaron a llover el mes pasado en Nueva Jersey, donde testigos y residentes empezaron a informar de avistamientos de drones en zonas costeras, incluida Cape May, una pintoresca ciudad situada a las afueras de Atlantic City.  Más recientemente, legisladores de Nueva York, Connecticut, Pensilvania y Maryland han informado de nuevos supuestos avistamientos de drones en sus estados de origen, y algunos testigos alegan que las aeronaves en cuestión han sido del ""tamaño de coches"" o se han visto sobrevolando infraestructuras sensibles o en espacio aéreo restringido.  El teniente detective retirado de la policía de la Autoridad Portuaria John Ryan dijo a Fox News Digital en una entrevista el viernes que el repunte de la actividad se debe probablemente a dos cosas.  La primera, dijo, es que los drones son una tecnología en rápida evolución que ha experimentado un auge tanto en su uso recreativo como comercial en EE.UU. en los últimos 10 años. Los datos federales sobre el registro de drones reflejan este fuerte aumento de su uso, que en su mayor parte, si no en su totalidad, es legal. En octubre de este año, había más de 790.000 drones registrados en la Asociación Federal de Aviación (FAA), y casi 400.000 drones comerciales registrados.  Eso es ""sólo para que te hagas una idea"" de la magnitud del número de drones legales que hay en EE.UU., dijo Ryan, cuya extensa carrera policial incluyó el servicio durante una década como comandante de operaciones especiales del servicio de emergencias del aeropuerto internacional John F. Kennedy de Nueva York y, más tarde, como oficial jefe de la Autoridad Portuaria, cuya función incluye la supervisión de todas las instalaciones de transporte, incluidos Kennedy, LaGuardia y todos los demás aeropuertos y puertos de la zona.  El segundo error, según Ryan , es que las personas en cuestión piden ayuda a las autoridades equivocadas.  ""El error que veo que comete la gente es que acude a las agencias equivocadas y hace estas preguntas"", añadió.  La FAA es el organismo federal encargado de registrar los drones y otras aeronaves estadounidenses. También es el encargado de supervisar el uso recreativo y comercial de drones en EE.UU.  ""En Nueva Jersey, han estado preguntando a FBI, han estado preguntando al Departamento de Seguridad Nacional - han estado preguntando a todo el mundo excepto a la gente a la que deberían preguntar"", dijo Ryan.

https://noticias.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-surprise-move-some-democrats-could-have-huge-consequences-trump,Fox News,right,Politics,NEWT GINGRICH: El movimiento sorpresa de algunos demócratas podría tener enormes consecuencias para Trump,"NUEVO¡Ahora puedes escuchar los artículos de Fox News !  El presidente Donald J. Trump obtuvo la pluralidad del voto popular y ganó decisivamente el colegio electoral (312 a 226). Esto ha dado a su segunda presidencia una sensación única de autoridad, de hecho, un mandato del pueblo estadounidense.  La regla del presidente Abraham Lincoln de que con sentimiento popular todo es posible y sin sentimiento popular nada es posible se está confirmando justo delante de nosotros.  Según Rasmussen Reports, el 55% de los votantes estadounidenses creían que las elecciones conferían un mandato claro a las políticas del presidente Trump. Sólo el 32% pensaba que no tenía un mandato (el 13% no estaba seguro).  Esto supone un apoyo de casi 2:1 a un mandato para la agenda Trump entre los que ya se han decidido.  NEWT GINGRICH: BIDEN PUEDE SER PRESIDENTE PERO TRUMP YA ES LÍDER DEL MUNDO LIBRE  El hecho es que: El presidente Trump tiene un programa amplio y creativo para reducir el tamaño del gobierno, recortar los impuestos, aumentar el sueldo neto y resolver una serie de problemas de la nación.  El pueblo estadounidense está de acuerdo en que la antorcha ha pasado de un demócrata liberal cognitivamente en declive y cada vez más pasivo al Presidente electo Trump. El Presidente Trump está llenando el vacío con notable rapidez.  Como escribí recientemente, estamos empezando a ver los primeros efectos del apoyo de la opinión pública a la agenda de Trump y el impulso de la aceptación internacional del presidente Trump como presidente de facto. Algunos demócratas están intentando averiguar cómo responder a los tiempos y a la política cambiantes de nuestra época.  El informe de esta semana de que el senador John Fetterman se inscribió en Truth Social y envió su primera verdad fue una primera señal de que algunos demócratas están abiertos a trabajar con la administración Trump . El demócrata de Pensilvania incluso atacó los casos legales contra el presidente Trump como políticos y pidió al presidente Joe Biden que indultara al nuevo presidente electo.  FETTERMAN DENUNCIA LOS CASOS LEGALES CONTRA TRUMP, HUNTER BIDEN EN SU PRIMER POST DE TRUTH SOCIAL: LOS DOS CASOS ERAN UNA MIERDA  Es posible que el senador Fetterman vaya a llenar el vacío dejado por el senador Joe Manchin, que se jubila, como pensador independiente dispuesto a trabajar con ambos partidos.  La incorporación de Elon Musk y Vivek Ramaswamy al equipo orientado al cambio del Presidente Trumpha añadido un nivel de prestigio y energía que resulta transformador. Tener la oportunidad de reunirse con el hombre más rico del mundo e intercambiar ideas con dos empresarios extraordinarios es una auténtica ruptura con el patrón normalmente aburrido de las reuniones a las que asisten los miembros.  Fue alentador cuando CNN informó el 4 de diciembre:  ""El representante demócrata Jared Moskowitz se unió a un grupo de congresistas liderado por los republicanos en apoyo del recién creado Departamento de Eficiencia Gubernamental, o DOGE, del presidente electo Donald Trump , codirigido por Musk y Vivek Ramaswamy. El representante demócrata Ro Khanna ha dicho que colaborará con Musk en determinados asuntos, y Vermont el senador independiente Bernie Sanders publicó recientemente en X que 'Elon Musk tiene razón'"".  El congresista Khanna representa a gran parte del sector innovador de alta tecnología del norte de California. Tiene un sentido real de hasta qué punto las nuevas tecnologías y el espíritu empresarial pueden modernizar el gobierno y reducir su coste. Escribió un artículo entero titulado ""Los demócratas pueden trabajar con el DOGE"" para MSNBC en el que señalaba cómo se podría hacer que el Pentágono fuera menos caro y más eficaz.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA VER MÁS OPINIONES DE FOX NEWS  Estos primeros indicadores de colaboración potencial pueden convertirse en una auténtica mayoría legislativa bipartidista para la agenda del presidente Trump.  La mayoría de los temas sobre los que hizo campaña el presidente Trump tienen entre un 60% y un 80% de aprobación. Con el púlpito intimidatorio de la Casa Blanca y los activistas de base que fueron una clave importante para que el presidente ganara el 5 de noviembre, puede ser positivo emprender una serie de iniciativas legislativas que atraigan los votos demócratas.  Cuando estaba en el Congreso, participé en dos asombrosos ciclos de victorias bipartidistas para temas conservadores populares.  En 1981, como miembro relativamente nuevo, trabajé en el programa trienal de recortes fiscales del presidente Ronald Reagan. Apelando al pueblo estadounidense y explicando cómo el bill mejoraría sus vidas, se desarrolló suficiente presión popular para conseguir que un tercio de los demócratas de la Cámara votaran con nosotros.  En 1996, como Presidente de la Cámara, aprobamos la reforma de la asistencia social bill , que fue la mayor reforma social conservadora de mi vida. Al hacer hincapié en el requisito del trabajo y reorientar las oficinas de asistencia social para que fueran agencias de ayuda al empleo , conseguimos que aumentara el número de niños que salían de la pobreza más que en ningún otro momento de la historia de EEUU. Aunque la izquierda dura odiaba los requisitos laborales, el apoyo popular a la reforma de la asistencia social (cerca del 90% en una encuesta, incluido el 88% de los que recibían asistencia social) hizo que los demócratas se dividieran por la mitad. Ganamos 101 demócratas y perdimos 101 demócratas.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA OBTENER LA APLICACIÓN FOX NEWS  Una conciliación bill que reduzca los impuestos y reforme la normativa para crear empleo -con tres o cuatro meses de comunicación, educación y organización de base- podría hacer que un número considerable de demócratas decidieran que tenían que apoyar la bill o enfrentarse a una derrota segura.  Existe el potencial para un bipartidismo positivo que reforme el establishment y cree una América mucho más dinámica, segura y próspera.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA LEER MÁS DE NEWT GINGRICH",US,
https://noticias.foxnews.com/us/rural-towns-push-divorce-big-cities-form-new-conservative-state,Fox News,right,Politics,Los pueblos rurales presionan para divorciarse de las grandes ciudades y formar un nuevo estado conservador,"Los votantes rurales de California están hartos de la mayoría demócrata de Sacramento y presionan para que sus comunidades se divorcien de las zonas urbanas azules que dominan la política estatal.  Los residentes conservadores de las regiones rurales de California están cansados del exceso de regulación, del elevado coste de la vida y de la miríada de políticas que salen de la Legislatura estatal dominada por los demócratas, dijo Paul Preston, que fundó el Nuevo Estado California con la esperanza de separarse de su sede actual.  ""Reconocimos que estábamos en una tiranía"", dijo Preston a Fox News Digital, citando la disparidad entre demócratas y republicanos en el gobierno estatal.  Preston, antiguo administrador escolar, describió California como un estadode ""partido único"" que funciona de forma similar a un régimen comunista, aprobando leyes que no tienen en cuenta a la clase rural.  GAVIN NEWSOM INTERROGADO POR EL ELEVADO PRECIO DE LA AYUDA 'A PRUEBA DETRUMP' CALIFORNIA: 'DESPILFARRO TOTAL'  Según el mapa propuesto, el nuevo estado de California comprendería casi todos los 58 condados de California, excepto la mayor parte del condado de Los Ángeles y partes del condado de Sacramento , San Francisco y otras partes de la zona de la Bahía. El mapa es puramente una propuesta y no representa las fronteras definitivas del estado, dijo Preston.  Sus partidarios sostienen que dividir California en dos proporcionaría una gobernanza más justa y receptiva a las zonas situadas fuera de las grandes ciudades del estado.  Preston señaló que el estado propuesto tendría frontera con México en un esfuerzo por combatir la inmigración ilegal. Entre sus muchas quejas están los problemas de delincuencia de California, que llevaron a los votantes a destituir al fiscal del distrito de San Francisco en 2022 y a la fiscal del condado de Alameda, Pamela Price, en noviembre. En el condado de Los Ángeles, los votantes destituyeron al fiscal del distrito George Gascon el 5 de noviembre, tras un solo mandato, ya que los críticos le culparon de ser demasiado indulgente con los delincuentes.  Los votantes también aprobaron firmemente la Proposición 36 de mano dura contra la delincuencia el mes pasado, a pesar de los esfuerzos de los demócratas del estado y del gobernador Gavin Newsom por preservar una década de políticas de reforma de la justicia penal que, según los críticos, permitieron a los delincuentes.  ""No creo que nadie vaya a decir a California que estamos libres de invasiones y de violencia doméstica"", dijo Preston, citando la delincuencia y el flujo de inmigrantes ilegales en el estado.  Fox News Digital se ha puesto en contacto con la oficina de Newsom y con el presidente de la Asamblea estatal, el demócrata Robert Rivas. El Partido Demócrata de California dijo que no había nadie disponible para comentar el asunto.  OPINIÓN: LA SENCILLA SOLUCIÓN A LA ""CALIFORNIZACIÓN"" DE LA POLÍTICA ENERGÉTICA ESTADOUNIDENSE  En los últimos años, California ha sido criticada por su elevado coste de la vida, su epidemia de personas sin hogar -a pesar de gastar miles de millones para abordar el problema- y sus indulgentes políticas de justicia penal y de estado santuario que, según los opositores, contribuyen a la delincuencia.  James Gallagher, líder republicano en la Asamblea estatal, dijo que no conocía el esfuerzo del Nuevo Estado California específicamente, pero afirmó: ""Lo entiendo perfectamente"". Sin embargo, Gallagher dijo que la división no es necesariamente urbana frente a rural, sino más bien costera frente a las comunidades del interior.  ""A menudo parece que hay dos estados separados en California,"" dijo a Fox News Digital. ""Esa parte del interior se siente completamente olvidada por Gavin Newsom y la supermayoría demócrata. Todas las políticas que salen de Sacramento no les afectan realmente (a los legisladores demócratas)"".  CALIFORNIA EL ENCLAVE COSTERO CERCANO A LA CIUDAD SANTUARIO INTENTA ""BLINDARSE"" CONTRA NEWSOM  Como ejemplo, Gallagher citó los mandatos sobre vehículos eléctricos dirigidos por California, que exigen que todas las ventas de vehículos nuevos en el estado sean modelos de emisiones cero para 2035, lo que, según él, perjudicaría a muchos residentes rurales.  Tina Hessong, de 55 años, que vive en Yuba City, unos kilómetros al norte de Sacramento, dijo que California es en realidad más conservadora de lo que se hace creer al resto del país. Citó el mapa del Colegio Electoral de las elecciones presidenciales de noviembre.  ""El mapa que ha salido de la reciente votación y lo rojo que es realmente el estado de California , es más representativo de lo que yo creo que es la realidad del estado de California "", declaró a Fox News Digital. ""Somos un estado rojo y los grandes centros azules -Los Ángeles y San Francisco - obtienen toda la representación porque tienen la mayor población"".  Ellen Lee Zhou, que creció en China y se ha presentado como candidata a la alcaldía de San Francisco, dijo que los legisladores demócratas y Newsom habían dado prioridad a los inmigrantes ilegales frente a los residentes legales y habían abandonado todo sentido común.  ""Lo que hemos visto en los últimos 10 años es increíble con los sin techo, el tráfico abierto de drogas y la prostitución"", dijo Zhou a Fox News Digital. ""No puedo explicarme lo que ha ocurrido con los dirigentes"".  A pesar de que el Vicepresidente Kamala Harris ganó el voto popular en todo el estado, con un gran apoyo de las regiones costeras, Trump se llevó la mayoría de los condados, principalmente en las zonas rurales.  LOS MIGRANTES CAPTURADOS EN LA FRONTERA FUERON TRASLADADOS EN AUTOBÚS Y SACADOS EN AVIÓN DE SAN DIEGO EN UN POSIBLE ""ENCUBRIMIENTO"" ANTES DE LAS ELECCIONES: FUNCIONARIO  Tras las elecciones del 5 de noviembre, Newsom visitó California's red counties, donde dijo a los votantes: ""Mensaje recibido"".  ""No me importa a quién hayas votado. Me importa la gente. Me importan los partidarios de Trump , me importan los partidarios de RFK Jr. (Robert Kennedy, Jr.), me importan los partidarios de Tucker Carlson, me importan los partidarios de Charlie Kirk, me importan los partidarios de Ben Shapiro, me importan todas las personas"", dijo durante una de sus paradas.  ""Me preocupan las personas que viven aquí, en las Sierras, la gente de San Diego, donde acabo de estar, o mi patio trasero en Fair Oaks, California"", añadió Newsom.  Trump ha atacado a las ciudades liberales, afirmando que están plagadas de delincuencia, que pagan demasiados impuestos y que se están desmoronando debido a las políticas demócratas centradas en la ideología ""woke"" en lugar de mejorar la calidad de vida de los residentes.  California tiene una larga historia de intentos de dividirse en trozos más pequeños. Desde 1850, cuando se convirtió en el 31º estado admitido en la unión, ha habido más de 220 intentos de bisecarlo, trisecarlo o diseccionarlo en seis estados más pequeños, según la Biblioteca Estatal California .  Más recientemente, el multimillonario capitalista de riesgo de Silicon Valley Tim Draper propuso una iniciativa para dividir California en seis estados, pero la propuesta no logró clasificarse para la votación de 2016.  NEWSOM VETA LA POLÉMICA BILL QUE HABRÍA DADO PRÉSTAMOS PARA VIVIENDA A INMIGRANTES ILEGALES  En 2018, Draper consiguió que se incluyera en la papeleta electoral de 2018 una medida para dividir California en tres estados, después de que el referéndum ""Cal 3"" obtuviera suficientes firmas de votantes. Sin embargo, el Tribunal Supremo del estado decidió el 18 de julio de 2018 retirar la pregunta de la papeleta ""porque se han planteado cuestiones significativas sobre la validez de la proposición"", afirma el sitio web de la biblioteca.  Otros estados también han apoyado algún tipo de esfuerzo sucesorio en el pasado.  En 2020, el gobernador de West Virginia, Jim Justice, dijo que los condados rurales descontentos de la vecina Virginia eran más que bienvenidos a unirse a su estado.  ""Si no eres realmente feliz donde estás, estamos con los brazos abiertos para sacarte de Virginia o de cualquier otro sitio donde puedas estar"", dijo entonces Justice, republicano. ""Defendemos firmemente la Segunda Enmienda y defendemos firmemente a los no nacidos"".  La división rural-urbana forma parte de la política desde hace mucho tiempo. En noviembre, Trump consiguió algunos avances en zonas urbanas, suburbanas y rurales, sorprendiendo a muchos.  CÓMO UN TERREMOTO POLÍTICO SACUDIÓ CALIFORNIA E HIZO QUE LA DELINCUENCIA ""POR FIN VOLVIERA A SER ILEGAL"".  A pesar de su creciente apoyo entre los californianos, Newsom ha convocado una sesión extraordinaria en medio de sus esfuerzos por ""Trump-proteger"" al Estado Dorado de posibles interferencias federales, pero dijo que trabajaría con la administración entrante.  ""Pero cuando haya una extralimitación, cuando se amenace la vida, cuando se atente contra los derechos y las libertades, actuaremos"", dijo. ""Y eso es exactamente de lo que trata esta sesión especial: de preparar a este estado para el éxito, independientemente de quién esté en la Casa Blanca"".  Aunque Preston no prevé una separación inmediata, teniendo en cuenta que el esfuerzo necesitaría la bendición de la Legislatura, cree que se producirá una apertura.  ""Se trata realmente de un debate urbano contra rural"", dijo. ""Nos han recibido muy bien en el Congreso (durante las visitas a Washington), incluso los demócratas. Es interesante que la gente que está empezando a ver lo que hacemos esté a bordo"".  Hawai fue el último estado admitido en la unión en 1959.

Luigi Mangione fue detenido el lunes tras una persecución y acusado del asesinato de Thompson, cometido a la salida de un hotel de Manhattan la semana pasada. Mangione se ha convertido en un héroe popular para algunas figuras de extrema izquierda que creen que la muerte de Thompson es una merecida reacción contra los gigantes de los seguros médicos, como UnitedHealthcare , que deniegan la cobertura o cobran primas elevadas.  La senadora demócrata por Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren condenó el asesinato esta semana, pero dijo que la muerte de Thompson debería servir también de ""advertencia"".  ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta, pero sólo se puede presionar a la gente hasta cierto punto"", declaró a HuffPost. ""Esta es una advertencia de que si presionas a la gente lo suficiente, pierde la fe en la capacidad de su gobierno para hacer cambios, pierde la fe en la capacidad de las personas que proporcionan la asistencia sanitaria para hacer cambios, y empieza a tomar el asunto en sus propias manos de formas que, en última instancia, serán una amenaza para todos"".  ELIZABETH WARREN DICE QUE EL ASESINATO DE UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO FUE UNA ADVERTENCIA: 'SÓLO SE PUEDE PRESIONAR A LA GENTE HASTA CIERTO PUNTO'  Warren hizo comentarios similares a la presentadora de MSNBC Joy Reid sobre el asesinato de Thompson.  ""La gente está muy enfadada por la asistencia sanitaria, creo que con razón, por negar la asistencia y por todo el sistema... matar a un CEO no es la forma de cambiar"", dijo Reid. ""Hay que regularlos"".  ""Lo diremos una y otra vez"", dijo Warren. ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta. Se juzga a este tipo que supuestamente ha matado al CEO de UnitedHealth[care], pero sólo se puede presionar a la gente hasta cierto punto, y entonces empiezan a tomarse la justicia por su mano.""  Warren se retractó más tarde de sus comentarios a Fox News Digital.  ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta. Punto"", dijo. ""Debería haber sido mucho más clara al decir que nunca hay justificación para el asesinato"".  El periodista Piers Morgan también se enfrentó a la periodista de izquierdas Taylor Lorenz por su aparente simpatía hacia Mangione durante un episodio de ""Piers Morgan Uncensored"" emitido el lunes por la noche. Durante el programa, Lorenz admitió que sentía ""alegría"" por la muerte de Thompson.  Cuando un escandalizado Morgan se enfrentó a Lorenz por sus comentarios, diciendo que Thompson es ""marido y padre"", Lorenz replicó: ""¡También lo son las decenas de miles de estadounidenses que asesinó! También lo son las decenas de miles de estadounidenses, estadounidenses inocentes, que murieron porque ejecutivos codiciosos de seguros sanitarios como éste impulsan una política de negar la asistencia a las personas más vulnerables.""  Más tarde dijo que nunca sintió ""alegría por la muerte de ese hombre"", sino porque más gente está prestando atención a los problemas sistémicos de la sanidad estadounidense.  La copresentadora de ""The View"" Sunny Hostin leyó comentarios la semana pasada burlándose de la muerte de Thompson en las redes sociales, diciendo que la celebración de parte del público estadounidense es ""reflejo de cómo se siente la gente respecto a su asistencia sanitaria"". En un momento dado dijo: ""¿No es algo?"".  EX REPORTERO DE LA WAPO DICE 'QUEREMOS A ESTOS EJECUTIVOS MUERTOS' TRAS EL ASESINATO DE LA ASEGURADORA CEO  ""Nuestro país es uno de los únicos que no tiene asistencia sanitaria universal, y no cuidamos de nuestros ancianos y la gente está sintiendo el pellizco"", dijo Hostin. ""Hablamos de ello todo el tiempo y creo que la gente está realmente enfadada con el sistema sanitario y, por desgracia, se está trasladando a este padre"".  La diputada Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, demócrata de Nueva York, también se ha pronunciado tras el asesinato de Thompson, afirmando que la violencia no estaba ""justificada"", pero que la gente considera la denegación del seguro médico como un acto propio de agresión.  ""Esto no quiere decir que un acto de violencia esté justificado, pero creo que para cualquiera que esté confundido o conmocionado o consternado, tiene que entender que la gente interpreta y siente y experimenta las reivindicaciones denegadas como un acto de violencia contra ellos"", declaró esta semana.

Karen Friedman Agnifilo will represent Mangione as he faces a second-degree murder charge in New York for the Dec. 4 shooting in Manhattan, a spokesperson for Friedman Agnifilo has confirmed.  Friedman Agnifilo previously worked as the chief assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for seven years and has experience in New York City’s criminal justice system. She has worked in private practice for the past three years with Agnifilo Intrater LLP.  HOW UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO GUNMAN'S WEAPON COULD WORK AGAINST HIM AND TO POLICE'S ADVANTAGE  ""Karen Friedman Agnifilo of Agnifilo Intrater LLP has been officially retained to represent Luigi Mangione in New York,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.  ""Ms. Friedman Agnifilo is a longtime veteran of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office and served as the second-in-command for seven years under DA Cyrus Vance, in addition to serving for four years as the Chief of the Office’s Trial Division.""  Friedman Agnifilo has three decades of experience in criminal justice, litigation and trials, according to Agnifilo Intrater.  Her practice focuses on criminal defense in state and federal courts and prosecuting serious violent crimes, including complex homicide cases.  She also represents plaintiffs in civil and employment matters and individuals in Title IX matters, a statute that protects persons from sex-based discrimination. She also specializes in internal investigations relating to misconduct, discrimination and sexual assault.  The news of Friedman Agnifilo representing Mangione comes as investigators have uncovered new evidence in recent days, including law enforcement determining that the 3D-printed gun Mangione had in his possession when he was arrested matches the three shell casings found at the crime scene in Midtown Manhattan. His fingerprints also matched the fingerprints found on items near the scene of the shooting.  Mangione remains in custody in Pennsylvania, where he was apprehended on gun-related charges, as he fights extradition to New York. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said there were indications Mangione may waive his extradition next week.  A Pennsylvania judge denied Mangione bail on Tuesday, leaving him behind bars at the Huntingdon State Correctional Institution.  The suspect is also facing charges in Pennsylvania of carrying a gun without a license, forgery, falsely identifying himself to the authorities and possessing ""instruments of crime."" New York prosecutors additionally hit him with three counts of illegal weapons possession and forgery, on top of the murder charge.

""Ambos enviaron mensajes a través de sus violentos asesinatos"", dijo John Kelly, perfilador criminal y presidente de System to Apprehend Lethal Killers. ""El Unabomber envió un mensaje hacia y sobre la industria tecnológica y sobre cómo ésta destruiría el país"".  El caso de Kaczynski fue el primero en el que Kelly trabajó. El Unabomber, FBI abreviatura del terrorista de la universidad y las aerolíneas, envió 16 bombas a lo largo de casi 20 años, incluida una que explotó en un avión tras alcanzar cierta altitud.  LA FAMILIA DEL SOSPECHOSO DE ASESINATO DE UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO SE PREGUNTA QUÉ SABÍA LA POLICÍA DURANTE LA PERSECUCIÓN  ""El sospechoso de UnitedHealthcare envió su mensaje al sector de los seguros, y no creo que fuera el último si no le pillan"", añadió.  Al igual que Kaczynski fabricaba sus propias bombas, el arma sospechosa del asesinato de Thompson contenía piezas caseras impresas en 3D, según Kelly.  La policía la describió como una ""pistola fantasma"" con receptor de plástico y supresor.  UNITED HEALTHCARE CEO EL SOSPECHOSO DE ASESINATO LUIGI MANGIONE SE QUEJÓ DE UNA OPERACIÓN DE ESPALDA ANTES DEL ASESINATO  EX REPORTERO DE LA WAPO DICE 'QUEREMOS A ESTOS EJECUTIVOS MUERTOS' TRAS EL ASESINATO DEL SEGURO CEO  ""Ninguno de los dos tuvo una relación significativa con una mujer"", dijo Kelly. ""Ambos podrían haber sufrido esquizofrenia. Seguro que el Unabomber sí. Luigi está en la edad madura en la que podría empezar"".  Kaczynski se suicidó en prisión el año pasado tras renunciar a someterse a tratamientos contra el cáncer. Cumplía cadena perpetua sin posibilidad de libertad condicional después de que su hermano leyera su manifiesto, enviado anónimamente al Washington Post en 1995 y lo delatara.  Al parecer, Mangione tenía un manifiesto escrito a mano cuando la policía de Altoona, Pensilvania, lo detuvo el lunes. En el manifiesto, supuestamente mencionaba UnitedHealthcare y la conferencia de accionistas a la que Thompson se dirigía en el momento del asesinato.  ""Ambos estaban obsesionados y centrados en industrias a las que querían hacer daño y concienciar a la opinión pública"", dijo Kelly.  SIGUE AL EQUIPO DE FOX TRUE CRIME EN X  Mangione aparecía periódicamente en Goodreads, la red social dedicada a la literatura, donde escribió una reseña de manifiesto de Kaczynski .  ""Es fácil tacharlo rápida e irreflexivamente (sic) de manifiesto de un lunático, para evitar enfrentarse a algunos de los incómodos problemas que identifica"", escribió. ""Pero es sencillamente imposible ignorar lo clarividentes que resultaron muchas de sus predicciones sobre la sociedad moderna"".  Escribiendo sobre ""La sociedad industrial y su futuro"" de Kaczynski, citó otra ""toma online que [le] pareció interesante"".  ""Cuando todas las demás formas de comunicación fracasan, la violencia es necesaria para sobrevivir"", escribió. ""Puede que no te gusten sus métodos, pero viendo las cosas desde su perspectiva, no es terrorismo, es guerra y revolución"".  UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO EL ATAQUE ""PREMEDITADO"" DE BRIAN THOMPSON Y LA HUIDA DEL SOSPECHOSO: CRONOLOGÍA  Elogió al terrorista en serie lobo solitario como un ""prodigio de las matemáticas"".

""Aunque estas acciones tienden a caracterizarse como las de un loco ludita (sic), sin embargo, se ven más exactamente como las de un revolucionario político extremo"".  Ambos hombres se habían recluido antes de sus presuntos crímenes. Kaczynski se mudó a una cabaña remota sin electricidad ni agua corriente para alejarse de la sociedad cada vez más tecnologizada que odiaba. La madre de Mangione denunció su desaparición a la policía de San Francisco el mes pasado, diciéndoles que no había podido ponerse en contacto con su hijo desde julio, según fuentes policiales.  La dirección de la empresa donde creía que trabajaba estaba permanentemente cerrada.  LA POLICÍA DE NUEVA YORK ENCUENTRA COINCIDENCIAS ENTRE EL ARMA Y LAS HUELLAS DACTILARES EN EL ASESINATO DE UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO , SEGÚN EL COMISARIO  ""Se convierte en un recluso"", dijo Nicole Parker, ex agente deFBI . ""Es entonces cuando realmente empieza a definir cómo va a ser. Eso es probablemente lo que le hizo empezar a recorrer este camino hacia la violencia. Pero no te engañes pensando que este chico nunca antes pensó así"".  Pero puso en duda que el presunto asesino actuara realmente solo.  ""Quiero ver el historial de llamadas de ese teléfono desechable"", dijo a Fox News Digital. ""Esos sentimientos no empezaron ayer ni hace tres meses. ¿Esos pensamientos internos que tenía? No"".  Al igual que Mangione, Kaczynski era un antiguo miembro de la Ivy Leaguer: licenciado en Harvard y matemático. El Unabomber mató a tres personas e hirió a 23 más entre 1978 y 1995 con una serie de bombas que envió por correo a sus víctimas.  MIRA 'ESCANDALOSO: UNABOMBER' EN FOX NATION  Un vídeo de vigilancia grabado en el exterior de un hotel Hilton del centro de Manhattan muestra a un asesino enmascarado acercándose sigilosamente por detrás a Thompson en la acera hacia las 6.45 horas del 4 de diciembre. Thompson se dirigía a una conferencia de accionistas en el establecimiento que iba a comenzar esa misma mañana, cuando el pistolero abrió fuego por la espalda.  Cuando el CEO se desplomó en la calle, una mujer que presenció el ataque huyó en una dirección y la figura enmascarada se alejó despreocupadamente en la otra. La policía siguió sus movimientos por toda Nueva York hasta una estación de autobuses, de donde salió una hora después del asesinato. Compartieron imágenes de vigilancia, que circularon ampliamente por Internet, y la policía lo detuvo el lunes en un McDonald's de Altoona, Pensilvania, después de que unos testigos lo reconocieran y llamaran al 911.

It was time to get to work, and he quickly realized that all the winning that comes with being a Chief is business at the end of the day.  ""You see why they win when you’re here,"" Worthy explained. ""They work hard, they go about their business the right way. They have the slogan called ‘The Formula’ – I feel like Coach Reid has hit [on] that in an interview. They really go about that every day, and I feel like it says a lot about the program.""  Of course, Worthy was not guaranteed to slot right in and get working with Mahomes immediately. First, he had to learn the playbook and then develop chemistry with his new quarterback on the practice field and in games.  Well, his first touch of his career, Worthy took an end-around flip from Mahomes to the house for a 21-yard rushing touchdown against the Baltimore Ravens.  Since then, Worthy has totaled 38 receptions on 67 targets for 448 yards with four touchdowns through the air, as well as 54 rushing yards and two touchdowns on the ground.  He feels the trust a quarterback needs in his receiver is there, leading to some pretty good first-year numbers.  ""Pat, he’s more of a guy that’s like, if you show you can go out there and do it, and he trusts you, and you earn his trust, he’s going to trust you throughout the season,"" Worthy said about Mahomes. ""I feel like I’ve earned his trust, and I feel like we’ve got something good rolling.""  A prime example of that came in the latest close-game victory for the Chiefs, which required Mahomes to orchestrate another game-winning drive.  On fourth-and-6 with the game on the line, Mahomes was scrambling around the pocket as the Los Angeles Chargers' pass rush was barreling through his offensive line, looking for a receiver to give him a chance to extend the drive.  Mahomes could have looked to Travis Kelce, DeAndre Hopkins or other veteran options if he wished. However, knowing where Worthy was going to be, he released the ball just as he turned around to look at his quarterback. Worthy ran back to the ball, secured it and kept the team's chances of winning alive.  Job well done, even if there was some pain involved.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play. I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video,"" Worthy said. ""But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  The stacked wins have resulted in what every rookie wants: playoff football.  Worthy gets that as the Chiefs secured the AFC West title for the ninth straight season after beating the Chargers, and the rookie is excited to continue developing that relationship with Mahomes to hopefully help their case for a third straight Super Bowl victory.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.

The lawsuit accused Jay-Z and Diddy of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000, Fox News Digital previously confirmed. Before Jay-Z was named, the rapper received a demand letter likely in an attempt to settle.  ""Things have escalated,"" Orange County criminal defense lawyer Lauren Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital, as the back-and-forth between Jay-Z's legal team and Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee now plays out in the public eye.  JAY-Z'S ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT: CAN RAP MOGUL FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES?  Fox News Digital looks back at the timeline leading to Jay-Z being named in the bombshell lawsuit:  Diddy accused of raping 13-year-old girl  Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was first accused of raping a 13-year-old while celebrities watched in October. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York on Oct. 20 by Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee on behalf of a Jane Doe.  The unidentified woman ended up at a VMAs afterparty after attempting to gain entry to the awards show at Radio City Music Hall, according to court documents.  ""One of the limousine drivers she spoke to claimed to work for [Diddy],"" the lawsuit read. ""He told her that Combs liked younger girls and said she ‘fit what Diddy was looking for,’ not allowing her into the Awards, but inviting her to an afterparty.""  The girl claimed after being given one drink, she found a room to lie down in because she became ""woozy and lightheaded."" At one point, Combs and two unidentified celebrities entered the room. ""Celebrity A"" allegedly raped the 13-year-old while Combs and ""Celebrity B"" watched. Afterwards, the young girl claimed Combs raped her while ""Celebrity A"" and ""Celebrity B"" watched.  Diddy denied the allegations in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.  WATCH ON FOX NATION: WHAT DIDDY DO?  Jay-Z receives a demand letter regarding the sexual assault lawsuit against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs  At some point, Jay-Z received a demand letter from the anonymous accuser's lawyer – unbeknownst to the public. Jay-Z confirmed this information in his statement denying the rape accusation.  ""My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a ‘lawyer’ named Tony Buzbee ,"" Jay-Z shared in the statement on Roc Nation's social media. ""What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.  ""No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!""  ""Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes."" — Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot  The decision to eventually publicly name Jay-Z was likely due to ""a failure to settle the case,"" a legal expert told Fox News Digital.  ""Jay-Z may have decided that settling the case would suggest to the public that he was somehow involved in the sexual assault of a minor,"" Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot, explained. ""After receiving a demand letter, Jay-Z and his legal team probably pushed back against the Plaintiff's accusations and may have tried to convince her counsel to not proceed with naming him as a Defendant.  ""The Plaintiff's attorney probably made a decision to proceed against Jay-Z after it became apparent that they would not settle the case. Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes.""  Jay-Z files lawsuit claiming extortion under ‘John Doe’  Before Jay-Z was named publicly in the lawsuit accusing him and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of rape, he sued his accuser's lawyer as a celebrity John Doe.  WATCH: JAY-Z ISSUES SCATHING DENIAL TO ALLEGATIONS HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL  On Nov. 18, his lawyers filed a lawsuit against Buzbee. Since then, Jay-Z confirmed he was the plaintiff in the anonymous lawsuit.  ""Plaintiff presently faces a gun to his head,"" the court document, obtained by Fox News Digital, read. Jay-Z's team claimed Buzbee and the anonymous accuser had demanded the rapper ""either repeatedly pay an exorbitant sum of money to stop Defendants from the wide publication of wildly false allegations of sexual assault that would subject [Jay-Z] to opprobrium and irreparably harm [Jay-Z's] reputation, family, career and livelihood, or else face the threat of an untold number of civil suits and financial and personal ruin.""  While Jay-Z accused Buzbee of extortion, legal experts claimed demand letters are typical in these types of cases.  ""It is standard for these types of letters to be sent before filing a case or including a defendant in a case,"" Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital. ""If a case can settle outside of court, that usually benefits everyone involved. It is not extortion, but it can feel like it to the defendant, especially if the ask is high.""  DeGroot added: ""The tone of these letters may vary. Given the high profile nature of Jay-Z, and having a sense that it would be leaked to the press, Mr. Buzbee is starting his litigation spin as early as possible to get the attention of Jay-Z and to influence potential jurors.""

The amended complaint, also filed by Tony Buzbee, named the rap mogul as ""Celebrity A.""  In the new version of the lawsuit, the 13-year-old became disoriented and found a bedroom to rest in after allegedly consuming one drink. Jay-Z, Diddy and female ""Celebrity B"" seemingly followed the girl into the room. She ""immediately recognized all three celebrities,"" according to the court document.  Jay-Z allegedly raped the girl, followed by Diddy's alleged rape of the plaintiff, all while ""celebrity B"" watched, the court document stated.  The ""Empire State of Mind"" rapper denied the allegations in a statement shared on Roc Nation's social media.  ""These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!! Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree? These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case,"" he wrote, in part.  ""Celebrity B"" remains unnamed, but will likely be revealed at some point in the process, according to a legal expert.  ""Since that person's participation appears to be that of a witness, her status is entirely different, unless there is a legal reason,"" DeGroot told Fox News Digital. ""It certainly appears that the celebrity would not want to be tarred with the same brush as Jay-Z and P. Diddy. Unless there is a protective order, her identity will in all likelihood be revealed during the discovery process.""  ""Celebrity B"" is ""undoubtedly"" in communication with Buzbee through a lawyer, Johnson-Norris noted.

Belichick sat in front of the media during his introductory press conference as the new head coach for the Tar Heels – an idea no college football fan would've fathomed until rumors began to swirl last week about his interest in running the program.  It was always thought that Belichick, who is 27 wins away from becoming the head coach with the most victories in NFL history, would return to the pros if he wished to continue coaching.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  But the 72-year-old explained on Thursday afternoon why he chose to go the college route.  ""​​I’ve always wanted to coach in college football,"" Belichick said. ""It just never really worked out. Had some good years in the NFL, so that was OK. But this is really a dream come true.""  BILL BELICHICK AGREES TO BECOME UNC'S NEXT HEAD FOOTBALL COACH  Belichick is obviously being modest by saying his time in the NFL was just ""good.""  Before the Kansas City Chiefs, he developed the New England Patriots into a dynasty, winning six Super Bowls and racking up wins that brought about the argument of greatest NFL head coach of all time.  College football, though, is a completely different beast, especially in this new NIL world. But these aren't waters Belichick just wants to dip his toes in – he's diving straight in and not looking to get out.  ""I didn't come here to leave,"" he said, dispelling thoughts for now that he's just trying to coach again before that next NFL opportunity opens up.  Belichick did say that, while the process may be different, the pros and college do have ""a lot of parallels."" It's why Michael Lombardi is coming in as the team's general manager, someone who knows how Belichick functions given their time together in New England.  ""I think that's the reason for the general structure with Michael as the general manager and myself as the coach and working collaboratively as we have done in a professional structure,"" Belichick explained.  For this big leap to be successful, Belichick knows he just needs to take things one day at a time. That starts with putting together his coaching staff, which he has already touched on with Freddie Kitchens coming aboard. More announcements should be made in the coming weeks.  Recruiting, not drafting, will also be interesting to watch with Belichick, but reports have indicated his wish for UNC to have the proper NIL resources to land top talent to make the program competitive.  As someone who was around the program as a kid – his father, Steve Belichick, coached with the Tar Heels in the 1950s – he understands what it means to be successful in Chapel Hill.

How could he not be happy when he is 12-1 to start off his first season in the NFL. Not many rookies get that luxury.  However, the first-round pick learned quickly what comes with the territory of being a team in search of three Super Bowls – playing the villain role.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Worthy, who broke the NFL Scouting Combine 40-yard dash record back in April, said he hears the outside noise, especially those wanting the Chiefs to lose each week.  ""I feel like everybody just wants us to lose,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital after highlighting the fun he had with the DICKS Holiday Shopping Sprint to impact kids in the Kansas City area for the holidays.  CHIEFS' ALTERNATE REALITY: KANSAS CITY WOULD BE 2011 IF THEIR ONE-SCORE GAME RESULTS WERE FLIPPED IN 2024  ""Every week, it’s a new excuse. First, the goal post is helping us. Then, it’s the refs helping us. I mean, we can’t get a break. But it’s cool to have that. It shows that everybody wants us to lose, we have a target on our backs, and we have to continue working each and every week.""  The Chiefs are a dynasty, and Worthy entered the fray right after they defeated the San Francisco 49ers in overtime to collect back-to-back Vince Lombardi trophies.  Just ask any other dynasty in the NFL what happens when they are on top. Fans will raise them up and ultimately want to watch them fall with a new winner crowned.  However, Worthy brings up a reason why some fans cannot stand to watch the Chiefs stack wins. They have been in so many close games this season, but they have maintained their winning streak in those one-score bouts.  For the last 15 games that have been determined by one score, the Chiefs have come out victorious. Yes, the goal post was involved this past week as Matthew Wright doinked it off the left side, but it went through to beat the Los Angeles Chargers. Additionally, there have been some controversial calls that have gone the Chiefs' way in the end.  Being the villain, though, is not something the Chiefs care about. They embrace it, and Worthy is just getting a taste of what Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and other veterans on the team have been feeling since last season.  ""It fuels us,"" Worthy explained. ""A lot of people say it’s hate, like, ‘Oh, people are always going against us.’ But how we look at it, the world’s watching us. You have all these eyes – you make the best of the opportunity with all these eyes on you.""  Worthy is no stranger to having a target on his back after playing for a large college program like the Texas Longhorns.  CHIEFS ARE KINGS OF CLOSING OUT GAMES, AND WHAT ELSE WE LEARNED IN WEEK 14  However, he touched on the senior leadership that helps guide the pact, especially Mahomes, who he continues to build a rapport with each week.  The proof is in the game tape, as Mahomes, scrambling on fourth-and-6 to continue the team's game-winning drive, threw a pass to Worthy with the game on the line, and he came back to the ball, secured it and kept the drive alive.  He even injured himself on the play, but his quarterback trusted him with the game on the line. A little pain is worth it in that case.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play,"" he said. ""I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video. But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  With four games remaining and the AFC West title locked up for the ninth straight season, Worthy knows he will also be a rookie that enjoys playoff football at the end of the regular season.  He is also well aware that the target will be even larger with the Chiefs looking to become the first team ever to win three straight Super Bowls.  If Kansas City has to be the villain to do so, then that is perfectly fine for Worthy, who is solely focused on being the team's hero when it is his turn to make a play.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.

But earlier this week, The Guardian US reported that Belichick agreed to become the new head coach in Chapel Hill, adding that Belichick handed the school a 400 page ""organizational bible"" with structure, payment plans, staffing choices etc.  Wallace reports one of the biggest components to the deal was Belichick having enough NIL money to compete in the recruiting space, which was agreed to. He also wanted to pick his assistant coaches, and UNC is giving them the resources to get who he wants, even if buyouts are necessary.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Among those assistants expected to join the staff is Stephen Belichick, his son who serves as Washington's defensive coordinator. It was reported that the elder Belichick had the unusual request of wanting his son to become his successor, stepping in when he decides to leave the program.  This will mark Belichick's first stint as a college football coach. His father, Steve Belichick, was a longtime assistant coach at Navy. But he did have a stint in the 1950s with the Tar Heels.  Belichick has spent much of the ongoing NFL season in the media spotlight after his interviews for NFL jobs didn't lead to a job offer.  While he interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons in January, the franchise opted against extending an offer. Belichick did not appear to draw much interest from any other NFL team, but his regular appearances on ESPN's ""ManningCast"" and the CW's ""Inside the NFL"" have kept him close to football.  During an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" earlier this week, Belichick confirmed he had talks with UNC about their head coaching vacancy, adding that he spent the 11 months since his departure from the Patriots taking a ""longer look"" at college football throughout the season as opposed to during the spring lead-up to the draft as a pro coach.  ""So it’s been, it’s been a good year for me. I’ve learned a lot,"" Belichick said. ""So, I’ve had the opportunity to talk to Chancellor [Lee] Roberts, and we’ve had a couple of good conversations. So we’ll see how it goes.""  Belichick opted not to go into more detail when asked by McAfee. Instead, Belichick offered a quip about his reputation for giving terse responses during news conferences with the Patriots.  ""Yeah, let’s just leave it at that, Pat,"" Belichick said with a grin. ""I mean, I don’t want to give out too much information. I want to get my press conference aura back.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Belichick shared some details about the makeup of a college program if he were a head coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" he said. ""It would be a professional program — training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history. He finished the 2023 season with 333 career wins — which places him in second on the all-time coaches wins list. Don Shula's 347 wins still leads all coaches.",US,0.9967
https://www.foxnews.com/sports/unc-on-board-have-bill-belichick-become-next-head-coach-still-working-out-issues-deal-report,Fox News,right,International,"UNC 'on board' to have Bill Belichick become next head coach, still working out issues with deal","Bill Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels are working to close a deal to make him their next head football coach, which would be his first-ever time coaching in college.  However, ESPN reported that ""there are still issues that both sides need to work through.""  The report adds that the ""ball is in Belichick’s court"" as UNC officials are indeed on board with him taking over the program. And there is expected to be a ""resolution"" soon.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  In fact, OutKick's Trey Wallace reports it's come down to just NIL money, which was among the issues that needed to be worked out in the negotiations. If that can be agreed to, an emergency trustee meeting would be called to finalize the deal.  What exactly are the other issues? Well, the potential role of Belichick’s son, Washington Huskies defensive coordinator Stephen Belichick, is one of them.  It was reported by The Guardian that, among the elder Belichick’s stipulations, his son would be named his heir to the head coach role once the 72-year-old moves on, whenever that would be.  ESPN added Belichick’s salary for taking over and more need to be ironed out before a deal can be agreed to.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  It came as a shock when Belichick’s name was floated for the Tar Heels' vacant position after longtime head coach Mack Brown said he wouldn’t return after this season.  Some of Belichick’s ex-pupils, like Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, had some fun on FOX NFL Sunday this past week mimicking their old coach trying to deal with recruiting in this NIL age of college sports.  ""There’s a lot of things he can do, and obviously he’s tremendous, and even showing his personality. But getting out there on the recruiting trail and dealing with all these college kids,"" Brady said on the NFL pregame show. ""’Listen, do you really want to come here?’"" Brady said, acting as Belichick. ""’I mean, we don’t really want you anyway, but I guess you could come, we’ll figure out if you play.’""  But this wasn’t just a publicity stunt. There’s more than just mutual interest in Belichick’s return to coaching in Chapel Hill.  ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Belichick and UNC officials spent five hours discussing a potential deal on Sunday, and in typical Belichick fashion, he wouldn’t divulge any details during his weekly spot on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Monday morning.  He admitted having a ""couple of good conversations"" with Lee Roberts, UNC’s chancellor, and added, ""We’ll see how that goes.""  If a deal goes through, it would be one of the most polarizing head coach hires for a college program in history, as Belichick has only ever been a head coach in the NFL, where he won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots.  FORMER NFL COACH BRUCE ARIANS OFFERS ADVICE TO BILL BELICHICK AS NORTH CAROLINA FOOTBALL COACHING RUMORS SWIRL  His time with the franchise came to an end before this 2024 season. They mutually parted ways and Belichick’s attempts at finding another role elsewhere were all for naught. He has since joined the sports media space, offering his insight to various outlets, including ESPN, but being open to another opportunity in football was always in the cards.  However, it was always expected that such an opportunity would come from the NFL, and there are several head coaching roles already open in the league, making this situation even more surprising.  But Belichick told McAfee and his crew what would happen if he were to become a college football coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" Belichick said. ""It would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Simply put, Belichick would bring to college football the system he knows works in the NFL, aiming for good players to join his team who will one day turn pro with the tools necessary for easy acclimation.  Time will tell if that program will be at UNC, but it appears some boxes need to be checked before a groundbreaking deal crosses the finish line.

The Boston Red Sox have landed Crochet in a blockbuster trade with the Chicago White Sox.  Boston is sending prospect catcher Kyle Teel, outfielder Braden Montgomery, infielder Chase Meidroth and right-handed pitcher Wikelman Gonzalez to the White Sox in exchange for Crochet.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  The New York Mets, who already landed Juan Soto on a record-breaking $765 million deal, were reportedly also in the running for Crochet's services next season. The Red Sox, a team with a deep farm system, unloaded four top-15 prospects to get the deal done, per MLB Pipeline.  What the Red Sox get in return is a budding star in their rotation, which needed a stud from the left side. Crochet is also under cheap team control for two years before becoming a free agent in 2027.  YANKEES SIGN ACE PITCHER TO HISTORIC CONTRACT AFTER LOSING JUAN SOTO SWEEPSTAKES: REPORTS  The White Sox made all the wrong MLB history last season with the worst record ever in a single year, but Crochet was a lone bright spot on the roster.  In his first All-Star season, Crochet pitched to a 3.58 ERA over 146 innings with 209 strikeouts and 33 walks.  His swing-and-miss stuff is what the Red Sox hope can be delivered at Fenway Park and beyond this season as a top-line rotation piece.  After the New York Yankees landed Max Fried, another reported Red Sox target in free agency, on an eight-year deal, Boston GM Craig Breslow quickly pivoted to Crochet to make sure they got a key piece for 2025 and beyond.  The Red Sox are not expected to be done, however. They were in on the Soto sweepstakes while also checking in on other position players as they hope to build a team worthy of reaching the postseason.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As for the White Sox, their rebuild continues, and top prospects like the ones they got in this deal are what’s needed to make that work in the long run.

https://noticias.foxnews.com/media/george-stephanopoulos-abc-apologize-trump-forced-pay-15-million-settle-defamation-suit,Fox News,right,International,"George Stephanopoulos y ABC piden disculpas a Trump, se ven obligados a pagar 15 millones de dólares para resolver una demanda por difamación","FIRST ON FOX- ABC News y su principal presentador George Stephanopoulos han llegado a un acuerdo con Donald Trump en su demanda por difamación, por el que la cadena de noticias pagará al presidente electo 15 millones de dólares.  El acuerdo se hizo público el sábado, revelando que las dos partes han llegado a un acuerdo y han evitado un costoso juicio. Según el acuerdo, ABC News pagará 15 millones de dólares como contribución benéfica a una ""fundación y museo presidenciales que serán establecidos por o para el demandante, como los presidentes de los Estados Unidos de América han establecido en el pasado"". Además, la cadena pagará 1 millón de dólares en concepto de honorarios de abogados a Trump.  Stephanopoulos y ABC News también tuvieron que emitir declaraciones de ""arrepentimiento"" como nota del editor al pie de un artículo publicado en Internet el 10 de marzo de 2024, sobre los comentarios realizados a principios de año que llevaron a Trump a presentar la demanda por difamación. La nota dice: ""ABC News y George Stephanopoulos lamentan las declaraciones sobre el presidente Donald J. Trump realizadas durante una entrevista de George Stephanopoulos con el diputado Nancy Mace en el programa This Week de la ABC el 10 de marzo de 2024"".  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, DE ABC NEWS, DIJO INEXACTAMENTE QUE TRUMP FUE DECLARADO ""RESPONSABLE DE VIOLACIÓN"" 10 VECES, DICEN GURÚS JURÍDICOS  ABC News dijo que la cadena estaba ""satisfecha"" de haber concluido el caso.  ""Nos complace que las partes hayan llegado a un acuerdo para desestimar la demanda en los términos de la presentación judicial"", dijo un portavoz de ABC News a Fox News Digital.  Trump presentó una demanda por difamación contra Stephanopoulos después de que éste afirmara que Trump había sido declarado ""responsable de violación"" en una causa civil durante una polémica entrevista con el diputado Nancy Mace, republicano de Carolina del Sur, el pasado mes de marzo.  Tras reproducir un fragmento en el que Mace hablaba de haber sido víctima de una violación, Stephanopoulos le preguntó: ""¿Cómo compaginas tu apoyo a Donald Trump con el testimonio que acabamos de ver?"".  ""Has apoyado a Donald Trump para presidente. Los jueces y dos jurados distintos le han declarado responsable de violación y de difamar a la víctima de esa violación"", dijo Stephanopoulos, en alusión a la victoria legal de la acusadora de Trump , E. Jean Carroll.  Stephanopoulos repitió esa afirmación diez veces durante su rifirrafe con Mace, a pesar de que un jurado determinó realmente que Trump era responsable de ""abuso sexual"", que tiene una definición distinta según la ley de Nueva York.  Después de que el jurado federal declarara a Trump responsable de abuso sexual, pero no de violación, el juez Lewis Kaplan escribió en una sentencia posterior que el hecho de que Carroll no probara la violación ""en el sentido de la Ley Penal de Nueva York no significa que no probara que el Sr. Trump la ""violara"" tal como mucha gente entiende comúnmente la palabra ""violación"""".  FETTERMAN DENUNCIA LOS CASOS LEGALES CONTRA TRUMP, HUNTER BIDEN EN SU PRIMER POST DE TRUTH SOCIAL: LOS DOS CASOS ERAN UNA MIERDA  Al principio, Stephanopoulos se mostró desafiante ante la demanda de Trumpy dijo al presentador de la CBS Stephen Colbert que no se dejaría ""amedrentar para dejar de hacer mi trabajo por una amenaza"".  ""Trump me demandó porque utilicé la palabra 'violación', aunque un juez dijo que eso es de hecho lo que ocurrió. Presentamos una moción de desestimación"", dijo Stephanopoulos.  El acuerdo se alcanzó después de que la juez Lisette M. Reid ordenara el viernes a Trump y Stephanopoulos que prestaran declaración la semana que viene, antes de la fecha límite del 24 de diciembre para que los acusados presentaran una petición de juicio sumario, con el fin de evitar un juicio.  En su demanda contra Stephanopoulos y ABC, Trump estuvo representado por los abogados de Florida Alejandro Brito y Richard Klugh. El acuerdo con ABC se presentó ante el Tribunal Federal del Distrito Sur de Florida , donde ambas partes firmaron y aceptaron los términos.  NEWT GINGRICH: BIDEN PUEDE SER PRESIDENTE PERO TRUMP YA ES LÍDER DEL MUNDO LIBRE  El acuerdo se produce tras una serie de victorias legales de Trump y su equipo jurídico, coordinado por el asesor jurídico principal Boris Epshteyn.  La juez federal Tanya Chutkan accedió recientemente a la petición del abogado especial Jack Smith de desestimar su caso contra Trump relacionado con las elecciones de 2020. Smith también desestimó el lunes su apelación en el caso de los registros clasificados, después de que un juez federal desestimara totalmente los cargos en julio, dictaminando que había sido nombrado ilegalmente como abogado especial.  En Nueva York contra Trump, el juez Juan Merchan accedió a la petición de Trumpde presentar una moción para desestimar los cargos derivados del caso del fiscal del distrito de Manhattan, Alvin Bragg, y retiró del calendario la fecha de sentencia del presidente electo.  Trump también ha demandado a CBS News por daños y perjuicios por valor de 10.000 millones de dólares, afirmando que la cadena practicó una ""conducta engañosa"" con el fin de interferir en las elecciones en su entrevista de octubre con el vicepresidente Kamala Harris .

https://noticias.foxnews.com/live-news/new-jersey-drone-mystery-reported-sightings-live-updates-12-14-2024,Fox News,right,International,"Los expertos descartan el pánico ""infundado"" a los drones mientras se informa de avistamientos en Nueva Jersey, Nueva York y otros lugares","Los avistamientos de ""drones"" en el noreste desatan un pánico ""infundado"", según un experto  ​  Un repunte de supuestos avistamientos de drones a lo largo de la Costa Este provocó el viernes una oleada de peticiones de investigación por parte de residentes y legisladores estatales, a pesar de que los funcionarios públicos insisten en que las aeronaves en cuestión vuelan, de hecho, legalmente, y un experto en aviación retirado de la autoridad portuaria dice a Fox News Digital que los temores son exagerados.  Las quejas sobre drones empezaron a llover el mes pasado en Nueva Jersey, donde testigos y residentes empezaron a informar de avistamientos de drones en zonas costeras, incluida Cape May, una pintoresca ciudad situada a las afueras de Atlantic City.  Más recientemente, legisladores de Nueva York, Connecticut, Pensilvania y Maryland han informado de nuevos supuestos avistamientos de drones en sus estados de origen, y algunos testigos alegan que las aeronaves en cuestión han sido del ""tamaño de coches"" o se han visto sobrevolando infraestructuras sensibles o en espacio aéreo restringido.  El teniente detective retirado de la policía de la Autoridad Portuaria John Ryan dijo a Fox News Digital en una entrevista el viernes que el repunte de la actividad se debe probablemente a dos cosas.  La primera, dijo, es que los drones son una tecnología en rápida evolución que ha experimentado un auge tanto en su uso recreativo como comercial en EE.UU. en los últimos 10 años. Los datos federales sobre el registro de drones reflejan este fuerte aumento de su uso, que en su mayor parte, si no en su totalidad, es legal. En octubre de este año, había más de 790.000 drones registrados en la Asociación Federal de Aviación (FAA), y casi 400.000 drones comerciales registrados.  Eso es ""sólo para que te hagas una idea"" de la magnitud del número de drones legales que hay en EE.UU., dijo Ryan, cuya extensa carrera policial incluyó el servicio durante una década como comandante de operaciones especiales del servicio de emergencias del aeropuerto internacional John F. Kennedy de Nueva York y, más tarde, como oficial jefe de la Autoridad Portuaria, cuya función incluye la supervisión de todas las instalaciones de transporte, incluidos Kennedy, LaGuardia y todos los demás aeropuertos y puertos de la zona.  El segundo error, según Ryan , es que las personas en cuestión piden ayuda a las autoridades equivocadas.  ""El error que veo que comete la gente es que acude a las agencias equivocadas y hace estas preguntas"", añadió.  La FAA es el organismo federal encargado de registrar los drones y otras aeronaves estadounidenses. También es el encargado de supervisar el uso recreativo y comercial de drones en EE.UU.  ""En Nueva Jersey, han estado preguntando a FBI, han estado preguntando al Departamento de Seguridad Nacional - han estado preguntando a todo el mundo excepto a la gente a la que deberían preguntar"", dijo Ryan.

https://noticias.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-surprise-move-some-democrats-could-have-huge-consequences-trump,Fox News,right,International,NEWT GINGRICH: El movimiento sorpresa de algunos demócratas podría tener enormes consecuencias para Trump,"NUEVO¡Ahora puedes escuchar los artículos de Fox News !  El presidente Donald J. Trump obtuvo la pluralidad del voto popular y ganó decisivamente el colegio electoral (312 a 226). Esto ha dado a su segunda presidencia una sensación única de autoridad, de hecho, un mandato del pueblo estadounidense.  La regla del presidente Abraham Lincoln de que con sentimiento popular todo es posible y sin sentimiento popular nada es posible se está confirmando justo delante de nosotros.  Según Rasmussen Reports, el 55% de los votantes estadounidenses creían que las elecciones conferían un mandato claro a las políticas del presidente Trump. Sólo el 32% pensaba que no tenía un mandato (el 13% no estaba seguro).  Esto supone un apoyo de casi 2:1 a un mandato para la agenda Trump entre los que ya se han decidido.  NEWT GINGRICH: BIDEN PUEDE SER PRESIDENTE PERO TRUMP YA ES LÍDER DEL MUNDO LIBRE  El hecho es que: El presidente Trump tiene un programa amplio y creativo para reducir el tamaño del gobierno, recortar los impuestos, aumentar el sueldo neto y resolver una serie de problemas de la nación.  El pueblo estadounidense está de acuerdo en que la antorcha ha pasado de un demócrata liberal cognitivamente en declive y cada vez más pasivo al Presidente electo Trump. El Presidente Trump está llenando el vacío con notable rapidez.  Como escribí recientemente, estamos empezando a ver los primeros efectos del apoyo de la opinión pública a la agenda de Trump y el impulso de la aceptación internacional del presidente Trump como presidente de facto. Algunos demócratas están intentando averiguar cómo responder a los tiempos y a la política cambiantes de nuestra época.  El informe de esta semana de que el senador John Fetterman se inscribió en Truth Social y envió su primera verdad fue una primera señal de que algunos demócratas están abiertos a trabajar con la administración Trump . El demócrata de Pensilvania incluso atacó los casos legales contra el presidente Trump como políticos y pidió al presidente Joe Biden que indultara al nuevo presidente electo.  FETTERMAN DENUNCIA LOS CASOS LEGALES CONTRA TRUMP, HUNTER BIDEN EN SU PRIMER POST DE TRUTH SOCIAL: LOS DOS CASOS ERAN UNA MIERDA  Es posible que el senador Fetterman vaya a llenar el vacío dejado por el senador Joe Manchin, que se jubila, como pensador independiente dispuesto a trabajar con ambos partidos.  La incorporación de Elon Musk y Vivek Ramaswamy al equipo orientado al cambio del Presidente Trumpha añadido un nivel de prestigio y energía que resulta transformador. Tener la oportunidad de reunirse con el hombre más rico del mundo e intercambiar ideas con dos empresarios extraordinarios es una auténtica ruptura con el patrón normalmente aburrido de las reuniones a las que asisten los miembros.  Fue alentador cuando CNN informó el 4 de diciembre:  ""El representante demócrata Jared Moskowitz se unió a un grupo de congresistas liderado por los republicanos en apoyo del recién creado Departamento de Eficiencia Gubernamental, o DOGE, del presidente electo Donald Trump , codirigido por Musk y Vivek Ramaswamy. El representante demócrata Ro Khanna ha dicho que colaborará con Musk en determinados asuntos, y Vermont el senador independiente Bernie Sanders publicó recientemente en X que 'Elon Musk tiene razón'"".  El congresista Khanna representa a gran parte del sector innovador de alta tecnología del norte de California. Tiene un sentido real de hasta qué punto las nuevas tecnologías y el espíritu empresarial pueden modernizar el gobierno y reducir su coste. Escribió un artículo entero titulado ""Los demócratas pueden trabajar con el DOGE"" para MSNBC en el que señalaba cómo se podría hacer que el Pentágono fuera menos caro y más eficaz.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA VER MÁS OPINIONES DE FOX NEWS  Estos primeros indicadores de colaboración potencial pueden convertirse en una auténtica mayoría legislativa bipartidista para la agenda del presidente Trump.  La mayoría de los temas sobre los que hizo campaña el presidente Trump tienen entre un 60% y un 80% de aprobación. Con el púlpito intimidatorio de la Casa Blanca y los activistas de base que fueron una clave importante para que el presidente ganara el 5 de noviembre, puede ser positivo emprender una serie de iniciativas legislativas que atraigan los votos demócratas.  Cuando estaba en el Congreso, participé en dos asombrosos ciclos de victorias bipartidistas para temas conservadores populares.  En 1981, como miembro relativamente nuevo, trabajé en el programa trienal de recortes fiscales del presidente Ronald Reagan. Apelando al pueblo estadounidense y explicando cómo el bill mejoraría sus vidas, se desarrolló suficiente presión popular para conseguir que un tercio de los demócratas de la Cámara votaran con nosotros.  En 1996, como Presidente de la Cámara, aprobamos la reforma de la asistencia social bill , que fue la mayor reforma social conservadora de mi vida. Al hacer hincapié en el requisito del trabajo y reorientar las oficinas de asistencia social para que fueran agencias de ayuda al empleo , conseguimos que aumentara el número de niños que salían de la pobreza más que en ningún otro momento de la historia de EEUU. Aunque la izquierda dura odiaba los requisitos laborales, el apoyo popular a la reforma de la asistencia social (cerca del 90% en una encuesta, incluido el 88% de los que recibían asistencia social) hizo que los demócratas se dividieran por la mitad. Ganamos 101 demócratas y perdimos 101 demócratas.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA OBTENER LA APLICACIÓN FOX NEWS  Una conciliación bill que reduzca los impuestos y reforme la normativa para crear empleo -con tres o cuatro meses de comunicación, educación y organización de base- podría hacer que un número considerable de demócratas decidieran que tenían que apoyar la bill o enfrentarse a una derrota segura.  Existe el potencial para un bipartidismo positivo que reforme el establishment y cree una América mucho más dinámica, segura y próspera.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA LEER MÁS DE NEWT GINGRICH",US,
https://noticias.foxnews.com/us/rural-towns-push-divorce-big-cities-form-new-conservative-state,Fox News,right,International,Los pueblos rurales presionan para divorciarse de las grandes ciudades y formar un nuevo estado conservador,"Los votantes rurales de California están hartos de la mayoría demócrata de Sacramento y presionan para que sus comunidades se divorcien de las zonas urbanas azules que dominan la política estatal.  Los residentes conservadores de las regiones rurales de California están cansados del exceso de regulación, del elevado coste de la vida y de la miríada de políticas que salen de la Legislatura estatal dominada por los demócratas, dijo Paul Preston, que fundó el Nuevo Estado California con la esperanza de separarse de su sede actual.  ""Reconocimos que estábamos en una tiranía"", dijo Preston a Fox News Digital, citando la disparidad entre demócratas y republicanos en el gobierno estatal.  Preston, antiguo administrador escolar, describió California como un estadode ""partido único"" que funciona de forma similar a un régimen comunista, aprobando leyes que no tienen en cuenta a la clase rural.  GAVIN NEWSOM INTERROGADO POR EL ELEVADO PRECIO DE LA AYUDA 'A PRUEBA DETRUMP' CALIFORNIA: 'DESPILFARRO TOTAL'  Según el mapa propuesto, el nuevo estado de California comprendería casi todos los 58 condados de California, excepto la mayor parte del condado de Los Ángeles y partes del condado de Sacramento , San Francisco y otras partes de la zona de la Bahía. El mapa es puramente una propuesta y no representa las fronteras definitivas del estado, dijo Preston.  Sus partidarios sostienen que dividir California en dos proporcionaría una gobernanza más justa y receptiva a las zonas situadas fuera de las grandes ciudades del estado.  Preston señaló que el estado propuesto tendría frontera con México en un esfuerzo por combatir la inmigración ilegal. Entre sus muchas quejas están los problemas de delincuencia de California, que llevaron a los votantes a destituir al fiscal del distrito de San Francisco en 2022 y a la fiscal del condado de Alameda, Pamela Price, en noviembre. En el condado de Los Ángeles, los votantes destituyeron al fiscal del distrito George Gascon el 5 de noviembre, tras un solo mandato, ya que los críticos le culparon de ser demasiado indulgente con los delincuentes.  Los votantes también aprobaron firmemente la Proposición 36 de mano dura contra la delincuencia el mes pasado, a pesar de los esfuerzos de los demócratas del estado y del gobernador Gavin Newsom por preservar una década de políticas de reforma de la justicia penal que, según los críticos, permitieron a los delincuentes.  ""No creo que nadie vaya a decir a California que estamos libres de invasiones y de violencia doméstica"", dijo Preston, citando la delincuencia y el flujo de inmigrantes ilegales en el estado.  Fox News Digital se ha puesto en contacto con la oficina de Newsom y con el presidente de la Asamblea estatal, el demócrata Robert Rivas. El Partido Demócrata de California dijo que no había nadie disponible para comentar el asunto.  OPINIÓN: LA SENCILLA SOLUCIÓN A LA ""CALIFORNIZACIÓN"" DE LA POLÍTICA ENERGÉTICA ESTADOUNIDENSE  En los últimos años, California ha sido criticada por su elevado coste de la vida, su epidemia de personas sin hogar -a pesar de gastar miles de millones para abordar el problema- y sus indulgentes políticas de justicia penal y de estado santuario que, según los opositores, contribuyen a la delincuencia.  James Gallagher, líder republicano en la Asamblea estatal, dijo que no conocía el esfuerzo del Nuevo Estado California específicamente, pero afirmó: ""Lo entiendo perfectamente"". Sin embargo, Gallagher dijo que la división no es necesariamente urbana frente a rural, sino más bien costera frente a las comunidades del interior.  ""A menudo parece que hay dos estados separados en California,"" dijo a Fox News Digital. ""Esa parte del interior se siente completamente olvidada por Gavin Newsom y la supermayoría demócrata. Todas las políticas que salen de Sacramento no les afectan realmente (a los legisladores demócratas)"".  CALIFORNIA EL ENCLAVE COSTERO CERCANO A LA CIUDAD SANTUARIO INTENTA ""BLINDARSE"" CONTRA NEWSOM  Como ejemplo, Gallagher citó los mandatos sobre vehículos eléctricos dirigidos por California, que exigen que todas las ventas de vehículos nuevos en el estado sean modelos de emisiones cero para 2035, lo que, según él, perjudicaría a muchos residentes rurales.  Tina Hessong, de 55 años, que vive en Yuba City, unos kilómetros al norte de Sacramento, dijo que California es en realidad más conservadora de lo que se hace creer al resto del país. Citó el mapa del Colegio Electoral de las elecciones presidenciales de noviembre.  ""El mapa que ha salido de la reciente votación y lo rojo que es realmente el estado de California , es más representativo de lo que yo creo que es la realidad del estado de California "", declaró a Fox News Digital. ""Somos un estado rojo y los grandes centros azules -Los Ángeles y San Francisco - obtienen toda la representación porque tienen la mayor población"".  Ellen Lee Zhou, que creció en China y se ha presentado como candidata a la alcaldía de San Francisco, dijo que los legisladores demócratas y Newsom habían dado prioridad a los inmigrantes ilegales frente a los residentes legales y habían abandonado todo sentido común.  ""Lo que hemos visto en los últimos 10 años es increíble con los sin techo, el tráfico abierto de drogas y la prostitución"", dijo Zhou a Fox News Digital. ""No puedo explicarme lo que ha ocurrido con los dirigentes"".  A pesar de que el Vicepresidente Kamala Harris ganó el voto popular en todo el estado, con un gran apoyo de las regiones costeras, Trump se llevó la mayoría de los condados, principalmente en las zonas rurales.  LOS MIGRANTES CAPTURADOS EN LA FRONTERA FUERON TRASLADADOS EN AUTOBÚS Y SACADOS EN AVIÓN DE SAN DIEGO EN UN POSIBLE ""ENCUBRIMIENTO"" ANTES DE LAS ELECCIONES: FUNCIONARIO  Tras las elecciones del 5 de noviembre, Newsom visitó California's red counties, donde dijo a los votantes: ""Mensaje recibido"".  ""No me importa a quién hayas votado. Me importa la gente. Me importan los partidarios de Trump , me importan los partidarios de RFK Jr. (Robert Kennedy, Jr.), me importan los partidarios de Tucker Carlson, me importan los partidarios de Charlie Kirk, me importan los partidarios de Ben Shapiro, me importan todas las personas"", dijo durante una de sus paradas.  ""Me preocupan las personas que viven aquí, en las Sierras, la gente de San Diego, donde acabo de estar, o mi patio trasero en Fair Oaks, California"", añadió Newsom.  Trump ha atacado a las ciudades liberales, afirmando que están plagadas de delincuencia, que pagan demasiados impuestos y que se están desmoronando debido a las políticas demócratas centradas en la ideología ""woke"" en lugar de mejorar la calidad de vida de los residentes.  California tiene una larga historia de intentos de dividirse en trozos más pequeños. Desde 1850, cuando se convirtió en el 31º estado admitido en la unión, ha habido más de 220 intentos de bisecarlo, trisecarlo o diseccionarlo en seis estados más pequeños, según la Biblioteca Estatal California .  Más recientemente, el multimillonario capitalista de riesgo de Silicon Valley Tim Draper propuso una iniciativa para dividir California en seis estados, pero la propuesta no logró clasificarse para la votación de 2016.  NEWSOM VETA LA POLÉMICA BILL QUE HABRÍA DADO PRÉSTAMOS PARA VIVIENDA A INMIGRANTES ILEGALES  En 2018, Draper consiguió que se incluyera en la papeleta electoral de 2018 una medida para dividir California en tres estados, después de que el referéndum ""Cal 3"" obtuviera suficientes firmas de votantes. Sin embargo, el Tribunal Supremo del estado decidió el 18 de julio de 2018 retirar la pregunta de la papeleta ""porque se han planteado cuestiones significativas sobre la validez de la proposición"", afirma el sitio web de la biblioteca.  Otros estados también han apoyado algún tipo de esfuerzo sucesorio en el pasado.  En 2020, el gobernador de West Virginia, Jim Justice, dijo que los condados rurales descontentos de la vecina Virginia eran más que bienvenidos a unirse a su estado.  ""Si no eres realmente feliz donde estás, estamos con los brazos abiertos para sacarte de Virginia o de cualquier otro sitio donde puedas estar"", dijo entonces Justice, republicano. ""Defendemos firmemente la Segunda Enmienda y defendemos firmemente a los no nacidos"".  La división rural-urbana forma parte de la política desde hace mucho tiempo. En noviembre, Trump consiguió algunos avances en zonas urbanas, suburbanas y rurales, sorprendiendo a muchos.  CÓMO UN TERREMOTO POLÍTICO SACUDIÓ CALIFORNIA E HIZO QUE LA DELINCUENCIA ""POR FIN VOLVIERA A SER ILEGAL"".  A pesar de su creciente apoyo entre los californianos, Newsom ha convocado una sesión extraordinaria en medio de sus esfuerzos por ""Trump-proteger"" al Estado Dorado de posibles interferencias federales, pero dijo que trabajaría con la administración entrante.  ""Pero cuando haya una extralimitación, cuando se amenace la vida, cuando se atente contra los derechos y las libertades, actuaremos"", dijo. ""Y eso es exactamente de lo que trata esta sesión especial: de preparar a este estado para el éxito, independientemente de quién esté en la Casa Blanca"".  Aunque Preston no prevé una separación inmediata, teniendo en cuenta que el esfuerzo necesitaría la bendición de la Legislatura, cree que se producirá una apertura.  ""Se trata realmente de un debate urbano contra rural"", dijo. ""Nos han recibido muy bien en el Congreso (durante las visitas a Washington), incluso los demócratas. Es interesante que la gente que está empezando a ver lo que hacemos esté a bordo"".  Hawai fue el último estado admitido en la unión en 1959.

Luigi Mangione fue detenido el lunes tras una persecución y acusado del asesinato de Thompson, cometido a la salida de un hotel de Manhattan la semana pasada. Mangione se ha convertido en un héroe popular para algunas figuras de extrema izquierda que creen que la muerte de Thompson es una merecida reacción contra los gigantes de los seguros médicos, como UnitedHealthcare , que deniegan la cobertura o cobran primas elevadas.  La senadora demócrata por Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren condenó el asesinato esta semana, pero dijo que la muerte de Thompson debería servir también de ""advertencia"".  ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta, pero sólo se puede presionar a la gente hasta cierto punto"", declaró a HuffPost. ""Esta es una advertencia de que si presionas a la gente lo suficiente, pierde la fe en la capacidad de su gobierno para hacer cambios, pierde la fe en la capacidad de las personas que proporcionan la asistencia sanitaria para hacer cambios, y empieza a tomar el asunto en sus propias manos de formas que, en última instancia, serán una amenaza para todos"".  ELIZABETH WARREN DICE QUE EL ASESINATO DE UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO FUE UNA ADVERTENCIA: 'SÓLO SE PUEDE PRESIONAR A LA GENTE HASTA CIERTO PUNTO'  Warren hizo comentarios similares a la presentadora de MSNBC Joy Reid sobre el asesinato de Thompson.  ""La gente está muy enfadada por la asistencia sanitaria, creo que con razón, por negar la asistencia y por todo el sistema... matar a un CEO no es la forma de cambiar"", dijo Reid. ""Hay que regularlos"".  ""Lo diremos una y otra vez"", dijo Warren. ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta. Se juzga a este tipo que supuestamente ha matado al CEO de UnitedHealth[care], pero sólo se puede presionar a la gente hasta cierto punto, y entonces empiezan a tomarse la justicia por su mano.""  Warren se retractó más tarde de sus comentarios a Fox News Digital.  ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta. Punto"", dijo. ""Debería haber sido mucho más clara al decir que nunca hay justificación para el asesinato"".  El periodista Piers Morgan también se enfrentó a la periodista de izquierdas Taylor Lorenz por su aparente simpatía hacia Mangione durante un episodio de ""Piers Morgan Uncensored"" emitido el lunes por la noche. Durante el programa, Lorenz admitió que sentía ""alegría"" por la muerte de Thompson.  Cuando un escandalizado Morgan se enfrentó a Lorenz por sus comentarios, diciendo que Thompson es ""marido y padre"", Lorenz replicó: ""¡También lo son las decenas de miles de estadounidenses que asesinó! También lo son las decenas de miles de estadounidenses, estadounidenses inocentes, que murieron porque ejecutivos codiciosos de seguros sanitarios como éste impulsan una política de negar la asistencia a las personas más vulnerables.""  Más tarde dijo que nunca sintió ""alegría por la muerte de ese hombre"", sino porque más gente está prestando atención a los problemas sistémicos de la sanidad estadounidense.  La copresentadora de ""The View"" Sunny Hostin leyó comentarios la semana pasada burlándose de la muerte de Thompson en las redes sociales, diciendo que la celebración de parte del público estadounidense es ""reflejo de cómo se siente la gente respecto a su asistencia sanitaria"". En un momento dado dijo: ""¿No es algo?"".  EX REPORTERO DE LA WAPO DICE 'QUEREMOS A ESTOS EJECUTIVOS MUERTOS' TRAS EL ASESINATO DE LA ASEGURADORA CEO  ""Nuestro país es uno de los únicos que no tiene asistencia sanitaria universal, y no cuidamos de nuestros ancianos y la gente está sintiendo el pellizco"", dijo Hostin. ""Hablamos de ello todo el tiempo y creo que la gente está realmente enfadada con el sistema sanitario y, por desgracia, se está trasladando a este padre"".  La diputada Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, demócrata de Nueva York, también se ha pronunciado tras el asesinato de Thompson, afirmando que la violencia no estaba ""justificada"", pero que la gente considera la denegación del seguro médico como un acto propio de agresión.  ""Esto no quiere decir que un acto de violencia esté justificado, pero creo que para cualquiera que esté confundido o conmocionado o consternado, tiene que entender que la gente interpreta y siente y experimenta las reivindicaciones denegadas como un acto de violencia contra ellos"", declaró esta semana.

She also represents plaintiffs in civil and employment matters and individuals in Title IX matters, a statute that protects persons from sex-based discrimination. She also specializes in internal investigations relating to misconduct, discrimination and sexual assault.  The news of Friedman Agnifilo representing Mangione comes as investigators have uncovered new evidence in recent days, including law enforcement determining that the 3D-printed gun Mangione had in his possession when he was arrested matches the three shell casings found at the crime scene in Midtown Manhattan. His fingerprints also matched the fingerprints found on items near the scene of the shooting.  Mangione remains in custody in Pennsylvania, where he was apprehended on gun-related charges, as he fights extradition to New York. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said there were indications Mangione may waive his extradition next week.

""Ambos enviaron mensajes a través de sus violentos asesinatos"", dijo John Kelly, perfilador criminal y presidente de System to Apprehend Lethal Killers. ""El Unabomber envió un mensaje hacia y sobre la industria tecnológica y sobre cómo ésta destruiría el país"".  El caso de Kaczynski fue el primero en el que Kelly trabajó. El Unabomber, FBI abreviatura del terrorista de la universidad y las aerolíneas, envió 16 bombas a lo largo de casi 20 años, incluida una que explotó en un avión tras alcanzar cierta altitud.  LA FAMILIA DEL SOSPECHOSO DE ASESINATO DE UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO SE PREGUNTA QUÉ SABÍA LA POLICÍA DURANTE LA PERSECUCIÓN  ""El sospechoso de UnitedHealthcare envió su mensaje al sector de los seguros, y no creo que fuera el último si no le pillan"", añadió.  Al igual que Kaczynski fabricaba sus propias bombas, el arma sospechosa del asesinato de Thompson contenía piezas caseras impresas en 3D, según Kelly.  La policía la describió como una ""pistola fantasma"" con receptor de plástico y supresor.

""Ambos podrían haber sufrido esquizofrenia. Seguro que el Unabomber sí. Luigi está en la edad madura en la que podría empezar"".  Kaczynski se suicidó en prisión el año pasado tras renunciar a someterse a tratamientos contra el cáncer. Cumplía cadena perpetua sin posibilidad de libertad condicional después de que su hermano leyera su manifiesto, enviado anónimamente al Washington Post en 1995 y lo delatara.  Al parecer, Mangione tenía un manifiesto escrito a mano cuando la policía de Altoona, Pensilvania, lo detuvo el lunes. En el manifiesto, supuestamente mencionaba UnitedHealthcare y la conferencia de accionistas a la que Thompson se dirigía en el momento del asesinato.  ""Ambos estaban obsesionados y centrados en industrias a las que querían hacer daño y concienciar a la opinión pública"", dijo Kelly.  SIGUE AL EQUIPO DE FOX TRUE CRIME EN X  Mangione aparecía periódicamente en Goodreads, la red social dedicada a la literatura, donde escribió una reseña de manifiesto de Kaczynski .  ""Es fácil tacharlo rápida e irreflexivamente (sic) de manifiesto de un lunático, para evitar enfrentarse a algunos de los incómodos problemas que identifica"", escribió. ""Pero es sencillamente imposible ignorar lo clarividentes que resultaron muchas de sus predicciones sobre la sociedad moderna"".  Escribiendo sobre ""La sociedad industrial y su futuro"" de Kaczynski, citó otra ""toma online que [le] pareció interesante"".

https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/dollar-tree-could-drop-some-products-tariffs-enacted,Fox News,right,Business,Dollar Tree could drop some products if tariffs are enacted,"Dollar Tree said Wednesday it may adjust or even eliminate certain products if President-elect Trump’s proposed tariffs take effect.  The discount retailer, which has high exposure to China, told analysts it has a ""wide range of potential actions"" it can take to mitigate additional tariffs if they materialize, including changing product details or sizes and even getting rid of items altogether if they become too expensive.  Under the proposals, a universal 10%-20% tariff would be imposed on imports from all foreign countries, and an additional 60%-100% tariff would be imposed on imports specifically from China. Last month, Trump reiterated the threat, saying he would issue an executive order upon taking office to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all products coming into the U.S.  TRUMP'S PROPOSED TARIFFS COULD DRIVE UP FOOD PRICES, EXPERTS SAY  Dollar Tree said the last time the retailer faced this issue, in 2018 and 2019, it adjusted its products and negotiated lower costs with suppliers.  ""Those options are still at our disposal,"" interim CEO Michael Creedon told analysts on an earnings call Wednesday. ""On top of those, we now have detailed plans in place to shift supply sources for most of our products to alternate countries, and multi-price gives us additional flexibility on our product assortment.""  According to a regulatory filing, Dollar Tree directly imports as much as 43% of its total retail value purchases, with the vast majority from China.  ""China is the source of a vast majority of our direct imports, and we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported,"" the company said in a March 2024 filing.  Dollar Tree, which lost its CEO last month and continues to contend with lackluster demand and a highly competitive landscape, is the latest in a string of economists and retailers, including heavy hitters such as Walmart, who have commented on how tariffs would affect business.  GOLDMAN SACHS: TRUMP TAX CUTS, DEREGULATION WILL BOOST GROWTH; TARIFFS COULD BE A DRAG  Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey warned tariffs ""are going to be inflationary.""  ""Likely consumers are going to pay more for the items that they buy and that these tariffs are applied to,"" he told FOX Business.  While Rainey said two-thirds of the items the company sells are made, grown or assembled in the U.S., he said the company is ""in no way immune to this.""  Goldman Sachs warned in a note that Trump's proposed plans would add a tax on 43% of U.S. imports and could push inflation higher by nearly 1%.  Dollar Tree  ""Using our rule of thumb that every 1 [percentage point] increase in the effective tariff rate would raise core [personal consumption expenditures] PCE by 0.1%, we estimate that the proposed tariff increases would boost core PCE prices by 0.9% if implemented,"" the note, written by Goldman Sachs economists Alec Phillips and Ronnie Walker, states.

https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/penn-wharton-model-shows-ways-trump-admin-could-lower-debt-while-sustaining-economic-growth,Fox News,right,Business,Penn Wharton model shows ways Trump admin could lower debt while sustaining economic growth,"A new analysis by the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM) outlines policies that would reduce federal debt while spurring long-term economic growth, as the incoming Trump administration is due to face policy debates over taxes, spending and debt next year.  The federal government faces several key policy deadlines in 2025, starting with the debt limit suspension ending in January, which will require Congress and President-elect Trump to raise the debt limit to avoid default. Spending caps on the discretionary budget are set to expire when fiscal year 2025 ends in September, while portions of the Trump-era tax cuts are scheduled to sunset at the end of next year.  The confluence of those deadlines will leave policymakers facing a debate over how to address the massive national debt and spending growth, as well as resetting tax policies. PWBM's policy illustration focuses on four areas — simplifying the tax code, reducing tax-induced distortions, implementing taxes to address negative externalities and reinforcing the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare.  ""A common misunderstanding is that serious debt reduction must come at the expense of economic growth or the social safety net. We show this is incorrect,"" PWBM's analysts wrote. ""The reforms herein produce sustained debt reduction, grow the economy, reduce carbon emissions, almost fully close current gaps in working-age health-care coverage, and reduce poverty among retirees.""  US NATIONAL DEBT HITS A NEW RECORD: $36 TRILLION  The tax simplification outlined in the PWBM analysis includes taxing capital gains and dividends at ordinary income tax rates, as well as taxing capital gains at death without a stepped-up basis starting in 2025.  It would expand the employment tax base to cover all pass-through income, disallow all itemized deductions except for charitable deductions, remove the income exclusion of employer-sponsored health insurance premiums from taxable income and introduce mandatory health savings accounts that can cover up to $3,000 per year in out-of-pocket health care expenses.  PWBM's illustration would replace the standard deduction and personal exemptions with a partially refundable tax credit and lower the top income tax rate from 37% to 28% with no marginal rates above that.  It also includes a $50-per-ton carbon tax on coal, oil and natural gas products starting in 2025, which it estimates would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 7% in the short run and nearly 16% by 2054.  SOCIAL SECURITY CRISIS: BENEFICIARIES FACE 21% BENEFIT CUT WITHOUT REFORMS, SAYS CRFB  PWBM's analysis notes that the aging of America's population is straining the finances of Social Security and Medicare, as retirees are living longer and there are relatively fewer working-age families supporting more retirees. It suggests that the U.S. can't rely on economic growth alone to stabilize those programs' finances, so policy reforms are needed to achieve that.  ""The United States cannot grow its way out of the shortfalls facing these two major mandatory spending programs: the spending in both programs is either explicitly or implicitly indexed for growth. Both programs materially reduce the accumulation of savings and reduce the incentive to work, which reduces growth,"" PWBM said.  Among the policy changes would be raising the full-benefit Social Security retirement age from 67 to 70, a shift that would be phased in between 2037 and 2056 — so it wouldn't affect individuals who are older than 50 in 2025. New minimum and maximum benefits would also be implemented in 2037.  ECONOMIST OFFERS BIPARTISAN PLAN TO AVOID FINANCIAL CRISIS BY STABILIZING AMERICA'S SURGING NATIONAL DEBT  The Medicare eligibility age would also be raised from 65 to 67, with the change fully phased in by 2036 under the illustration. It would also convert Medicare to a premium support system in which beneficiaries would choose from different insurance plans, with the federal government sharing the cost of premiums.  With the U.S. population projected to decline without immigration and current immigration levels insufficient to address the narrowing gap between workers and retirees, PWBM's analysis included doubling the number of legal immigrants per year and requiring all immigrants to obtain unsubsidized health insurance.  Overall, PWBM found that the policies included in the analysis would boost GDP by 21% over 30 years compared to current law and raise wages by nearly 7% in that period, compared to current law.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  Private health insurance premiums would fall by 27% over 30 years, relative to current law, due to the requirement that immigrants obtain private health insurance reducing moral hazard, and expanding the insurance pool with younger, healthier individuals.  The federal debt held by the public, which is currently 99% of U.S. GDP and is projected to rise to 166% of GDP by 2054, would be 37.8% lower than the projection in 2054 under the PWBM analysis.",US,0.459

Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 along with company CEO Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman and others, split from the company in early 2018 after failing to secure control over the company as its majority shareholder and CEO and later attempting to convince its founders to merge it with Tesla.

In March 2024, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI that argued it breached its founding mission as a not-for-profit company by creating a for-profit structure. OpenAI has pushed back on that lawsuit, which was withdrawn and refiled over the summer, and outlined Musk's past agreement with a for-profit structure in a new blog post and legal filing.  OpenAI noted that in email conversations with other co-founders, Elon Musk questioned whether there should be a nonprofit structure before the company was announced in November 2015 and wrote in an email that the ""structure doesn't seem optimal … Probably better to have a standard C corp with a parallel nonprofit.""  ELON MUSK SUES OPENAI, SAM ALTMAN AGAIN  In July 2017, Musk and the OpenAI founders were discussing the company's next steps and a message from Brockman to Zilis, who was acting as a liaison between Musk and OpenAI, detailing notes from a meeting with Musk in which they discussed OpenAI potentially changing the structure to for-profit.  Brockman said in the message the meeting with Musk ""turned into talking about structure (he said non-profit was def the right one early on, may not be the right one now – ilya and I agree with this for a number of reasons).""  Progress made in advancing OpenAI's technology in August 2017 prompted Musk to suggest that it was ""time to make the next step for OpenAI. This is the triggering event."" It was a reference to an email from Brockman that suggested an OpenAI for-profit would launch in 2018.  ELON MUSK DROPS LAWSUIT AGAINST OPENAI  FOX Business learned from OpenAI's legal team that Musk then instructed his wealth manager in September 2017 to create a public benefit corporation called Open Artificial Intelligence Technologies Inc., which spurred negotiations about ownership terms.  Musk insisted on having majority equity and board control and serving as CEO. When the other co-founders declined those terms, Musk said discussions were over.  In January 2018, Musk said, ""OpenAI is on a path of certain failure relative to Google,"" and he suggested the company be acquired by Tesla. However, the OpenAI team opted against doing so, and the two sides were unable to agree on a path forward.  OPENAI PUSHES BACK ON ELON MUSK LAWSUIT, SAYS HE SUGGESTED MERGER WITH TESLA  Musk resigned from the company's board in February 2018 after hosting a goodbye meeting, saying he would pursue AI development at Tesla. He also told OpenAI it needed to raise ""billions per year immediately"" in December 2018 or else it had no chance of being relevant in the AI race with Google's DeepMind unit.  OpenAI publicly launched its capped-profit entity, which is governed by the nonprofit, in March 2019. The company shared an advance copy of the announcement with Musk, who replied, ""Please be explicit that I have no financial interest in the for-profit arm of OpenAI.""  The company's founders also offered Musk equity in the capped-profit entity multiple times over the years, which Musk has declined.

If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).  Two Texas parents filed a lawsuit this week against the makers of Character.AI, claiming the artificial intelligence chatbot is a ""clear and present danger to minors,"" with one plaintiff alleging it encouraged their teen to kill his parents.  According to the complaint, Character.AI ""abused and manipulated"" an 11-year-old girl, introducing and exposing her ""consistently to hypersexualized interactions that were not age appropriate, causing her to develop sexualized behaviors prematurely and without [her parent's] awareness.""  The complaint also accuses the chatbot of causing a 17-year-old boy to mutilate himself, and, among other things, sexually exploiting and abusing him while alienating the minor from his parents and church community.  UNITEDHEALTHCARE ACCUSED OF RELYING ON AI ALGORITHMS TO DENY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE CLAIMS  In response to the teen complaining that his parents were limiting his online activity, the bot allegedly wrote, according to a screenshot in the filing, ""You know sometimes I'm not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like ‘child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse.' I just have no hope for your parents.'""  CHARLES PAYNE: GOOGLE JUST SENT SHOCKWAVES ACROSS THE COMPUTING WORLD  The parents are suing Character.AI creator Character Technologies, along with co-founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, as well as Google and parent company Alphabet, over reports that Google invested some $3 billion in Character.

We are always working toward achieving that balance, as are many companies using AI across the industry.""  ""As part of this, we are creating a fundamentally different experience for teen users from what is available to adults,"" the statement continued. ""This includes a model specifically for teens that reduces the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content while preserving their ability to use the platform.""  GAMING PLATFORM ROBLOX TIGHTENS MESSAGING RULES FOR USERS UNDER 13  The Character spokesperson added that the platform is ""introducing new safety features for users under 18 in addition to the tools already in place that restrict the model and filter the content provided to the user.""  Google's naming in the lawsuit follows a report by The Wall Street Journal in September claiming the tech giant paid $2.7 billion to license Character's technology and rehire its co-founder, Noam Shazeer, who the article claims left Google in 2021 to start his own company after Google refused to launch a chatbot he developed.  ""Google and Character AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies, nor have we used them in our products,"" Google spokesperson José Castañeda told FOX Business in a statement when asked for comment on the lawsuit.  ""User safety is a top concern for us, which is why we’ve taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes,"" Castañeda added.  OPENAI RELEASES TEXT-TO-VIDEO AI MODEL SORA TO CERTAIN CHATGPT USERS  But this week's lawsuit raises further scrutiny about the safety of Character.AI, after Character Technologies was sued in September by a mother who claims the chatbot caused the suicide of her 14-year-old son.  The mother, Megan Garcia, says Character.AI targeted her son, Sewell Setzer, with ""anthropomorphic, hypersexualized, and frighteningly realistic experiences"".  Setzer began having conversations with various chatbots on Character.AI starting in April 2023, according to the lawsuit. The conversations were often text-based romantic and sexual interactions.  Setzer expressed thoughts of suicide and the chatbot repeatedly brought it up, according to the complaint. Setzer eventually died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in February after the company’s chatbot allegedly repeatedly encouraged him to do so.  ""We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of one of our users and want to express our deepest condolences to the family,"" Character Technologies said in a statement at the time.  Character.AI has since added a self-harm resource to its platform and new safety measures for users under the age of 18.  Character Technologies told CBS News that users are able to edit the bot's responses and that Setzer did in some of the messages.  ""Our investigation confirmed that, in a number of instances, the user rewrote the responses of the Character to make them explicit. In short, the most sexually graphic responses were not originated by the Character, and were instead written by the user,"" Jerry Ruoti, head of trust and safety at Character.AI told the outlet.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  Moving forward, Character.AI said the new safety features will include pop-ups with disclaimers that AI is not a real person and directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline when suicidal ideations are brought up.

They are expertly hand-built in the U.K. at 66% to 85% of their traditional size, and are powered by zero-emission electric propulsion systems.  According to founder Ben Hedley and CEO Hoss Hassani, these aren't just cars, they're ""drivable artwork.""  ""We don't make replicas. We make reinterpretations. So we're trying to… capture the zeitgeist, capture the essence [of] the original vehicle,"" Hedley said.  MECHANIC SHORTAGE PERSISTS AS WORKERS AGE OUT OF PROFESSION  Six years ago, Hedley received special permission to collaborate with some of the world’s most prestigious automotive brands after Bugatti approached him to recreate a children’s car the company made in the 1920s for their 110th anniversary.  But Hedley took a creative spin — rather than creating a toy car for kids, he made it large enough for adults to drive.  ""When you win a contract with Bugatti to make a car for them, you have one shot, you can't screw it up,"" Hedley told FOX Business.  He took pieces of an original Bugatti racecar from the 1920s, digitally scanned everything, and re-created it so it was 25% smaller than the original.  The company was stunned by the result, as they were expecting a toy, not a fully functional car, he recalled.  That moment was the turning point, sparking the creation of Hedley Studios, which now produces hundreds of exclusive vehicles for customers around the globe.  After impressing Bugatti, other major carmakers quickly followed suit. Hedley recalled walking into a meeting with Ferrari, proposal in hand, and securing a deal within just five minutes. The Italian luxury sports car manufacturer already had a project in mind, he recalled.  Image 1 of 6  Hedley and his team collaborate with each original equipment manufacturer to create scaled-down versions of iconic models, like the Aston Martin DB5, Ferrari Testa Rossa or Bugatti Type 35.

MILLIONS OF CAR OWNERS ARE DELAYING MAINTENANCE REPAIRS AS COSTS RISE  Each model is signed by the artist and includes an official chassis plate from the original manufacturer. Built with meticulous attention to detail, these limited-edition vehicles pay authentic homage to their originals.  The team does take some creative liberties, however. For example, they created a ""No Time to Die"" special edition Aston Martin DB5 Junior, inspired by the 25th James Bond film. The company said they 3D-scanned the original Aston Martin DB5 to ensure an entirely accurate reproduction. Like the original, Hedley’s version includes signature features, such as a smoke screen ejected through the rear ""exhaust.""  No matter what, Hedley said they have to exceed the original manufacturer's quality standards. He recognizes that this is both a challenge and a ""tremendous honor.""

Apple shares reached $250.42 during Wednesday's trading session, an all-time high that followed a record close of $247.70 at the end of Tuesday's trading day.  Though it has since declined from that peak to just under $248 a share during Thursday's session, the company's market capitalization of $3.74 trillion remains near its all-time high.  Apple's stock surge coincides with the 44th anniversary of its IPO, which was held on Dec. 12, 1980. Investors who bought Apple stock at that time — which was priced at $22 per share at the time of IPO — and held it for four decades would have seen massive growth in the value of that investment.  THE MASSIVE DOLLAR AMOUNT COMPANIES SPEND ON SECURITY FOR EXECUTIVES  The company has conducted five stock splits since its IPO, so when accounting for those, the split-adjusted basis for an Apple share at the time of the IPO was $0.10 per share.

The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in New Orleans and has a conservative majority, issued a 9-8 ruling that found the rules approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) violated federal securities law.  The decision comes as a significant legal victory for critics of policies meant to boost corporate racial and gender diversity.

The SEC said it is reviewing the ruling and would have to appeal to the Supreme Court if it seeks to overturn the decision. Nasdaq said that while it believed its rule would benefit companies and investors, it respected the court's ruling and doesn't plan to appeal.

The regulator said the ""outdated"" loophole exempted overdraft fees as a finance charge. The final rule, announced Thursday, makes several key updates to federal regulations governing overdraft fees for financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets.  DOJ SUES VISA OVER DEBIT CARD MARKET MONOPOLY  Now, a bank will either be able to charge $5 for overdrafts — only a fraction of what consumers typically get hit with — or limit fees so that they cover no more than the lender's costs.  Banks will still be able to continue to charge higher fees as long as they comply with longstanding lending laws, including disclosing any applicable interest rate.  Typically, financial institutions charge $35 for an overdraft loan despite the fact that the CFPB says the majority of consumers’ debit card overdrafts are for less than $26, and are repaid within three days.  The CFPB said this new rule is expected to generate $5 billion in annual overdraft fee savings for consumers, or about $225 per household that pays overdraft fees.  ""For far too long, the largest banks have exploited a legal loophole that has drained billions of dollars from Americans' deposit accounts,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said, adding that the regulator is ""requiring big banks to come clean about the interest rate they're charging on overdraft loans.""

One can guess how he feels about that after 13 games and a 12-1 record.  ""It’s kinda like a dream come true,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital ahead of Week 15.  CHIEFS ROOKIE XAVIER WORTHY SAYS TEAM THRIVES PLAYING IN VILLAIN ROLE: ‘EVERYBODY JUST WANTS US TO LOSE’  Worthy understood there was no time to geek out over Mahomes being his new signal caller. It was time to get to work, and he quickly realized that all the winning that comes with being a Chief is business at the end of the day.  ""You see why they win when you’re here,"" Worthy explained. ""They work hard, they go about their business the right way. They have the slogan called ‘The Formula’ – I feel like Coach Reid has hit [on] that in an interview. They really go about that every day, and I feel like it says a lot about the program.""  Of course, Worthy was not guaranteed to slot right in and get working with Mahomes immediately. First, he had to learn the playbook and then develop chemistry with his new quarterback on the practice field and in games.  Well, his first touch of his career, Worthy took an end-around flip from Mahomes to the house for a 21-yard rushing touchdown against the Baltimore Ravens.  Since then, Worthy has totaled 38 receptions on 67 targets for 448 yards with four touchdowns through the air, as well as 54 rushing yards and two touchdowns on the ground.  He feels the trust a quarterback needs in his receiver is there, leading to some pretty good first-year numbers.  ""Pat, he’s more of a guy that’s like, if you show you can go out there and do it, and he trusts you, and you earn his trust, he’s going to trust you throughout the season,"" Worthy said about Mahomes. ""I feel like I’ve earned his trust, and I feel like we’ve got something good rolling.""  A prime example of that came in the latest close-game victory for the Chiefs, which required Mahomes to orchestrate another game-winning drive.  On fourth-and-6 with the game on the line, Mahomes was scrambling around the pocket as the Los Angeles Chargers' pass rush was barreling through his offensive line, looking for a receiver to give him a chance to extend the drive.  Mahomes could have looked to Travis Kelce, DeAndre Hopkins or other veteran options if he wished. However, knowing where Worthy was going to be, he released the ball just as he turned around to look at his quarterback. Worthy ran back to the ball, secured it and kept the team's chances of winning alive.  Job well done, even if there was some pain involved.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play. I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video,"" Worthy said. ""But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  The stacked wins have resulted in what every rookie wants: playoff football.  Worthy gets that as the Chiefs secured the AFC West title for the ninth straight season after beating the Chargers, and the rookie is excited to continue developing that relationship with Mahomes to hopefully help their case for a third straight Super Bowl victory.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.

The lawsuit accused Jay-Z and Diddy of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000, Fox News Digital previously confirmed. Before Jay-Z was named, the rapper received a demand letter likely in an attempt to settle.  ""Things have escalated,"" Orange County criminal defense lawyer Lauren Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital, as the back-and-forth between Jay-Z's legal team and Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee now plays out in the public eye.  JAY-Z'S ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT: CAN RAP MOGUL FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES?  Fox News Digital looks back at the timeline leading to Jay-Z being named in the bombshell lawsuit:  Diddy accused of raping 13-year-old girl  Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was first accused of raping a 13-year-old while celebrities watched in October. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York on Oct. 20 by Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee on behalf of a Jane Doe.  The unidentified woman ended up at a VMAs afterparty after attempting to gain entry to the awards show at Radio City Music Hall, according to court documents.  ""One of the limousine drivers she spoke to claimed to work for [Diddy],"" the lawsuit read. ""He told her that Combs liked younger girls and said she ‘fit what Diddy was looking for,’ not allowing her into the Awards, but inviting her to an afterparty.""  The girl claimed after being given one drink, she found a room to lie down in because she became ""woozy and lightheaded."" At one point, Combs and two unidentified celebrities entered the room. ""Celebrity A"" allegedly raped the 13-year-old while Combs and ""Celebrity B"" watched. Afterwards, the young girl claimed Combs raped her while ""Celebrity A"" and ""Celebrity B"" watched.  Diddy denied the allegations in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.  WATCH ON FOX NATION: WHAT DIDDY DO?  Jay-Z receives a demand letter regarding the sexual assault lawsuit against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs  At some point, Jay-Z received a demand letter from the anonymous accuser's lawyer – unbeknownst to the public. Jay-Z confirmed this information in his statement denying the rape accusation.  ""My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a ‘lawyer’ named Tony Buzbee ,"" Jay-Z shared in the statement on Roc Nation's social media. ""What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.  ""No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!""  ""Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes."" — Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot  The decision to eventually publicly name Jay-Z was likely due to ""a failure to settle the case,"" a legal expert told Fox News Digital.  ""Jay-Z may have decided that settling the case would suggest to the public that he was somehow involved in the sexual assault of a minor,"" Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot, explained. ""After receiving a demand letter, Jay-Z and his legal team probably pushed back against the Plaintiff's accusations and may have tried to convince her counsel to not proceed with naming him as a Defendant.  ""The Plaintiff's attorney probably made a decision to proceed against Jay-Z after it became apparent that they would not settle the case. Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes.""  Jay-Z files lawsuit claiming extortion under ‘John Doe’  Before Jay-Z was named publicly in the lawsuit accusing him and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of rape, he sued his accuser's lawyer as a celebrity John Doe.  WATCH: JAY-Z ISSUES SCATHING DENIAL TO ALLEGATIONS HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL  On Nov. 18, his lawyers filed a lawsuit against Buzbee. Since then, Jay-Z confirmed he was the plaintiff in the anonymous lawsuit.  ""Plaintiff presently faces a gun to his head,"" the court document, obtained by Fox News Digital, read. Jay-Z's team claimed Buzbee and the anonymous accuser had demanded the rapper ""either repeatedly pay an exorbitant sum of money to stop Defendants from the wide publication of wildly false allegations of sexual assault that would subject [Jay-Z] to opprobrium and irreparably harm [Jay-Z's] reputation, family, career and livelihood, or else face the threat of an untold number of civil suits and financial and personal ruin.""  While Jay-Z accused Buzbee of extortion, legal experts claimed demand letters are typical in these types of cases.  ""It is standard for these types of letters to be sent before filing a case or including a defendant in a case,"" Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital. ""If a case can settle outside of court, that usually benefits everyone involved. It is not extortion, but it can feel like it to the defendant, especially if the ask is high.""  DeGroot added: ""The tone of these letters may vary. Given the high profile nature of Jay-Z, and having a sense that it would be leaked to the press, Mr. Buzbee is starting his litigation spin as early as possible to get the attention of Jay-Z and to influence potential jurors.""

The amended complaint, also filed by Tony Buzbee, named the rap mogul as ""Celebrity A.""  In the new version of the lawsuit, the 13-year-old became disoriented and found a bedroom to rest in after allegedly consuming one drink. Jay-Z, Diddy and female ""Celebrity B"" seemingly followed the girl into the room. She ""immediately recognized all three celebrities,"" according to the court document.  Jay-Z allegedly raped the girl, followed by Diddy's alleged rape of the plaintiff, all while ""celebrity B"" watched, the court document stated.  The ""Empire State of Mind"" rapper denied the allegations in a statement shared on Roc Nation's social media.  ""These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!! Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree? These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case,"" he wrote, in part.  ""Celebrity B"" remains unnamed, but will likely be revealed at some point in the process, according to a legal expert.  ""Since that person's participation appears to be that of a witness, her status is entirely different, unless there is a legal reason,"" DeGroot told Fox News Digital. ""It certainly appears that the celebrity would not want to be tarred with the same brush as Jay-Z and P. Diddy. Unless there is a protective order, her identity will in all likelihood be revealed during the discovery process.""  ""Celebrity B"" is ""undoubtedly"" in communication with Buzbee through a lawyer, Johnson-Norris noted.

Belichick sat in front of the media during his introductory press conference as the new head coach for the Tar Heels – an idea no college football fan would've fathomed until rumors began to swirl last week about his interest in running the program.  It was always thought that Belichick, who is 27 wins away from becoming the head coach with the most victories in NFL history, would return to the pros if he wished to continue coaching.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  But the 72-year-old explained on Thursday afternoon why he chose to go the college route.  ""​​I’ve always wanted to coach in college football,"" Belichick said. ""It just never really worked out. Had some good years in the NFL, so that was OK. But this is really a dream come true.""  BILL BELICHICK AGREES TO BECOME UNC'S NEXT HEAD FOOTBALL COACH  Belichick is obviously being modest by saying his time in the NFL was just ""good.""  Before the Kansas City Chiefs, he developed the New England Patriots into a dynasty, winning six Super Bowls and racking up wins that brought about the argument of greatest NFL head coach of all time.  College football, though, is a completely different beast, especially in this new NIL world. But these aren't waters Belichick just wants to dip his toes in – he's diving straight in and not looking to get out.  ""I didn't come here to leave,"" he said, dispelling thoughts for now that he's just trying to coach again before that next NFL opportunity opens up.  Belichick did say that, while the process may be different, the pros and college do have ""a lot of parallels."" It's why Michael Lombardi is coming in as the team's general manager, someone who knows how Belichick functions given their time together in New England.  ""I think that's the reason for the general structure with Michael as the general manager and myself as the coach and working collaboratively as we have done in a professional structure,"" Belichick explained.  For this big leap to be successful, Belichick knows he just needs to take things one day at a time. That starts with putting together his coaching staff, which he has already touched on with Freddie Kitchens coming aboard. More announcements should be made in the coming weeks.  Recruiting, not drafting, will also be interesting to watch with Belichick, but reports have indicated his wish for UNC to have the proper NIL resources to land top talent to make the program competitive.  As someone who was around the program as a kid – his father, Steve Belichick, coached with the Tar Heels in the 1950s – he understands what it means to be successful in Chapel Hill.

How could he not be happy when he is 12-1 to start off his first season in the NFL. Not many rookies get that luxury.  However, the first-round pick learned quickly what comes with the territory of being a team in search of three Super Bowls – playing the villain role.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Worthy, who broke the NFL Scouting Combine 40-yard dash record back in April, said he hears the outside noise, especially those wanting the Chiefs to lose each week.  ""I feel like everybody just wants us to lose,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital after highlighting the fun he had with the DICKS Holiday Shopping Sprint to impact kids in the Kansas City area for the holidays.  CHIEFS' ALTERNATE REALITY: KANSAS CITY WOULD BE 2011 IF THEIR ONE-SCORE GAME RESULTS WERE FLIPPED IN 2024  ""Every week, it’s a new excuse. First, the goal post is helping us. Then, it’s the refs helping us. I mean, we can’t get a break. But it’s cool to have that. It shows that everybody wants us to lose, we have a target on our backs, and we have to continue working each and every week.""  The Chiefs are a dynasty, and Worthy entered the fray right after they defeated the San Francisco 49ers in overtime to collect back-to-back Vince Lombardi trophies.  Just ask any other dynasty in the NFL what happens when they are on top. Fans will raise them up and ultimately want to watch them fall with a new winner crowned.  However, Worthy brings up a reason why some fans cannot stand to watch the Chiefs stack wins. They have been in so many close games this season, but they have maintained their winning streak in those one-score bouts.  For the last 15 games that have been determined by one score, the Chiefs have come out victorious. Yes, the goal post was involved this past week as Matthew Wright doinked it off the left side, but it went through to beat the Los Angeles Chargers. Additionally, there have been some controversial calls that have gone the Chiefs' way in the end.  Being the villain, though, is not something the Chiefs care about. They embrace it, and Worthy is just getting a taste of what Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and other veterans on the team have been feeling since last season.  ""It fuels us,"" Worthy explained. ""A lot of people say it’s hate, like, ‘Oh, people are always going against us.’ But how we look at it, the world’s watching us. You have all these eyes – you make the best of the opportunity with all these eyes on you.""  Worthy is no stranger to having a target on his back after playing for a large college program like the Texas Longhorns.  CHIEFS ARE KINGS OF CLOSING OUT GAMES, AND WHAT ELSE WE LEARNED IN WEEK 14  However, he touched on the senior leadership that helps guide the pact, especially Mahomes, who he continues to build a rapport with each week.  The proof is in the game tape, as Mahomes, scrambling on fourth-and-6 to continue the team's game-winning drive, threw a pass to Worthy with the game on the line, and he came back to the ball, secured it and kept the drive alive.  He even injured himself on the play, but his quarterback trusted him with the game on the line. A little pain is worth it in that case.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play,"" he said. ""I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video. But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  With four games remaining and the AFC West title locked up for the ninth straight season, Worthy knows he will also be a rookie that enjoys playoff football at the end of the regular season.  He is also well aware that the target will be even larger with the Chiefs looking to become the first team ever to win three straight Super Bowls.  If Kansas City has to be the villain to do so, then that is perfectly fine for Worthy, who is solely focused on being the team's hero when it is his turn to make a play.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.

The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach remained interested in returning to the sidelines at some point in the future, but it was always expected that he would make his way back to the NFL after missing out on a new gig following his departure from the New England Patriots before this season. After all, Belichick had been in the league in some role since 1975 prior to this season.  But earlier this week, The Guardian US reported that Belichick agreed to become the new head coach in Chapel Hill, adding that Belichick handed the school a 400 page ""organizational bible"" with structure, payment plans, staffing choices etc.  Wallace reports one of the biggest components to the deal was Belichick having enough NIL money to compete in the recruiting space, which was agreed to. He also wanted to pick his assistant coaches, and UNC is giving them the resources to get who he wants, even if buyouts are necessary.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Among those assistants expected to join the staff is Stephen Belichick, his son who serves as Washington's defensive coordinator. It was reported that the elder Belichick had the unusual request of wanting his son to become his successor, stepping in when he decides to leave the program.  This will mark Belichick's first stint as a college football coach. His father, Steve Belichick, was a longtime assistant coach at Navy. But he did have a stint in the 1950s with the Tar Heels.  Belichick has spent much of the ongoing NFL season in the media spotlight after his interviews for NFL jobs didn't lead to a job offer.  While he interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons in January, the franchise opted against extending an offer. Belichick did not appear to draw much interest from any other NFL team, but his regular appearances on ESPN's ""ManningCast"" and the CW's ""Inside the NFL"" have kept him close to football.  During an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" earlier this week, Belichick confirmed he had talks with UNC about their head coaching vacancy, adding that he spent the 11 months since his departure from the Patriots taking a ""longer look"" at college football throughout the season as opposed to during the spring lead-up to the draft as a pro coach.  ""So it’s been, it’s been a good year for me. I’ve learned a lot,"" Belichick said. ""So, I’ve had the opportunity to talk to Chancellor [Lee] Roberts, and we’ve had a couple of good conversations. So we’ll see how it goes.""  Belichick opted not to go into more detail when asked by McAfee. Instead, Belichick offered a quip about his reputation for giving terse responses during news conferences with the Patriots.  ""Yeah, let’s just leave it at that, Pat,"" Belichick said with a grin. ""I mean, I don’t want to give out too much information. I want to get my press conference aura back.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Belichick shared some details about the makeup of a college program if he were a head coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" he said. ""It would be a professional program — training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history. He finished the 2023 season with 333 career wins — which places him in second on the all-time coaches wins list. Don Shula's 347 wins still leads all coaches.",US,0.9967
https://www.foxnews.com/sports/unc-on-board-have-bill-belichick-become-next-head-coach-still-working-out-issues-deal-report,Fox News,right,Japan,"UNC 'on board' to have Bill Belichick become next head coach, still working out issues with deal","Bill Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels are working to close a deal to make him their next head football coach, which would be his first-ever time coaching in college.  However, ESPN reported that ""there are still issues that both sides need to work through.""  The report adds that the ""ball is in Belichick’s court"" as UNC officials are indeed on board with him taking over the program. And there is expected to be a ""resolution"" soon.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  In fact, OutKick's Trey Wallace reports it's come down to just NIL money, which was among the issues that needed to be worked out in the negotiations. If that can be agreed to, an emergency trustee meeting would be called to finalize the deal.  What exactly are the other issues? Well, the potential role of Belichick’s son, Washington Huskies defensive coordinator Stephen Belichick, is one of them.  It was reported by The Guardian that, among the elder Belichick’s stipulations, his son would be named his heir to the head coach role once the 72-year-old moves on, whenever that would be.  ESPN added Belichick’s salary for taking over and more need to be ironed out before a deal can be agreed to.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  It came as a shock when Belichick’s name was floated for the Tar Heels' vacant position after longtime head coach Mack Brown said he wouldn’t return after this season.  Some of Belichick’s ex-pupils, like Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, had some fun on FOX NFL Sunday this past week mimicking their old coach trying to deal with recruiting in this NIL age of college sports.  ""There’s a lot of things he can do, and obviously he’s tremendous, and even showing his personality. But getting out there on the recruiting trail and dealing with all these college kids,"" Brady said on the NFL pregame show. ""’Listen, do you really want to come here?’"" Brady said, acting as Belichick. ""’I mean, we don’t really want you anyway, but I guess you could come, we’ll figure out if you play.’""  But this wasn’t just a publicity stunt. There’s more than just mutual interest in Belichick’s return to coaching in Chapel Hill.  ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Belichick and UNC officials spent five hours discussing a potential deal on Sunday, and in typical Belichick fashion, he wouldn’t divulge any details during his weekly spot on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Monday morning.  He admitted having a ""couple of good conversations"" with Lee Roberts, UNC’s chancellor, and added, ""We’ll see how that goes.""  If a deal goes through, it would be one of the most polarizing head coach hires for a college program in history, as Belichick has only ever been a head coach in the NFL, where he won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots.  FORMER NFL COACH BRUCE ARIANS OFFERS ADVICE TO BILL BELICHICK AS NORTH CAROLINA FOOTBALL COACHING RUMORS SWIRL  His time with the franchise came to an end before this 2024 season. They mutually parted ways and Belichick’s attempts at finding another role elsewhere were all for naught. He has since joined the sports media space, offering his insight to various outlets, including ESPN, but being open to another opportunity in football was always in the cards.  However, it was always expected that such an opportunity would come from the NFL, and there are several head coaching roles already open in the league, making this situation even more surprising.  But Belichick told McAfee and his crew what would happen if he were to become a college football coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" Belichick said. ""It would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Simply put, Belichick would bring to college football the system he knows works in the NFL, aiming for good players to join his team who will one day turn pro with the tools necessary for easy acclimation.  Time will tell if that program will be at UNC, but it appears some boxes need to be checked before a groundbreaking deal crosses the finish line.

The Boston Red Sox have landed Crochet in a blockbuster trade with the Chicago White Sox.  Boston is sending prospect catcher Kyle Teel, outfielder Braden Montgomery, infielder Chase Meidroth and right-handed pitcher Wikelman Gonzalez to the White Sox in exchange for Crochet.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  The New York Mets, who already landed Juan Soto on a record-breaking $765 million deal, were reportedly also in the running for Crochet's services next season. The Red Sox, a team with a deep farm system, unloaded four top-15 prospects to get the deal done, per MLB Pipeline.  What the Red Sox get in return is a budding star in their rotation, which needed a stud from the left side. Crochet is also under cheap team control for two years before becoming a free agent in 2027.  YANKEES SIGN ACE PITCHER TO HISTORIC CONTRACT AFTER LOSING JUAN SOTO SWEEPSTAKES: REPORTS  The White Sox made all the wrong MLB history last season with the worst record ever in a single year, but Crochet was a lone bright spot on the roster.  In his first All-Star season, Crochet pitched to a 3.58 ERA over 146 innings with 209 strikeouts and 33 walks.  His swing-and-miss stuff is what the Red Sox hope can be delivered at Fenway Park and beyond this season as a top-line rotation piece.  After the New York Yankees landed Max Fried, another reported Red Sox target in free agency, on an eight-year deal, Boston GM Craig Breslow quickly pivoted to Crochet to make sure they got a key piece for 2025 and beyond.  The Red Sox are not expected to be done, however. They were in on the Soto sweepstakes while also checking in on other position players as they hope to build a team worthy of reaching the postseason.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As for the White Sox, their rebuild continues, and top prospects like the ones they got in this deal are what’s needed to make that work in the long run.

El acuerdo se hizo público el sábado, revelando que las dos partes han llegado a un acuerdo y han evitado un costoso juicio. Según el acuerdo, ABC News pagará 15 millones de dólares como contribución benéfica a una ""fundación y museo presidenciales que serán establecidos por o para el demandante, como los presidentes de los Estados Unidos de América han establecido en el pasado"". Además, la cadena pagará 1 millón de dólares en concepto de honorarios de abogados a Trump.  Stephanopoulos y ABC News también tuvieron que emitir declaraciones de ""arrepentimiento"" como nota del editor al pie de un artículo publicado en Internet el 10 de marzo de 2024, sobre los comentarios realizados a principios de año que llevaron a Trump a presentar la demanda por difamación. La nota dice: ""ABC News y George Stephanopoulos lamentan las declaraciones sobre el presidente Donald J. Trump realizadas durante una entrevista de George Stephanopoulos con el diputado Nancy Mace en el programa This Week de la ABC el 10 de marzo de 2024"".  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, DE ABC NEWS, DIJO INEXACTAMENTE QUE TRUMP FUE DECLARADO ""RESPONSABLE DE VIOLACIÓN"" 10 VECES, DICEN GURÚS JURÍDICOS  ABC News dijo que la cadena estaba ""satisfecha"" de haber concluido el caso.  ""Nos complace que las partes hayan llegado a un acuerdo para desestimar la demanda en los términos de la presentación judicial"", dijo un portavoz de ABC News a Fox News Digital.  Trump presentó una demanda por difamación contra Stephanopoulos después de que éste afirmara que Trump había sido declarado ""responsable de violación"" en una causa civil durante una polémica entrevista con el diputado Nancy Mace, republicano de Carolina del Sur, el pasado mes de marzo.  Tras reproducir un fragmento en el que Mace hablaba de haber sido víctima de una violación, Stephanopoulos le preguntó: ""¿Cómo compaginas tu apoyo a Donald Trump con el testimonio que acabamos de ver?"".  ""Has apoyado a Donald Trump para presidente. Los jueces y dos jurados distintos le han declarado responsable de violación y de difamar a la víctima de esa violación"", dijo Stephanopoulos, en alusión a la victoria legal de la acusadora de Trump , E. Jean Carroll.  Stephanopoulos repitió esa afirmación diez veces durante su rifirrafe con Mace, a pesar de que un jurado determinó realmente que Trump era responsable de ""abuso sexual"", que tiene una definición distinta según la ley de Nueva York.  Después de que el jurado federal declarara a Trump responsable de abuso sexual, pero no de violación, el juez Lewis Kaplan escribió en una sentencia posterior que el hecho de que Carroll no probara la violación ""en el sentido de la Ley Penal de Nueva York no significa que no probara que el Sr. Trump la ""violara"" tal como mucha gente entiende comúnmente la palabra ""violación"""".  FETTERMAN DENUNCIA LOS CASOS LEGALES CONTRA TRUMP, HUNTER BIDEN EN SU PRIMER POST DE TRUTH SOCIAL: LOS DOS CASOS ERAN UNA MIERDA  Al principio, Stephanopoulos se mostró desafiante ante la demanda de Trumpy dijo al presentador de la CBS Stephen Colbert que no se dejaría ""amedrentar para dejar de hacer mi trabajo por una amenaza"".  ""Trump me demandó porque utilicé la palabra 'violación', aunque un juez dijo que eso es de hecho lo que ocurrió. Presentamos una moción de desestimación"", dijo Stephanopoulos.  El acuerdo se alcanzó después de que la juez Lisette M. Reid ordenara el viernes a Trump y Stephanopoulos que prestaran declaración la semana que viene, antes de la fecha límite del 24 de diciembre para que los acusados presentaran una petición de juicio sumario, con el fin de evitar un juicio.  En su demanda contra Stephanopoulos y ABC, Trump estuvo representado por los abogados de Florida Alejandro Brito y Richard Klugh. El acuerdo con ABC se presentó ante el Tribunal Federal del Distrito Sur de Florida , donde ambas partes firmaron y aceptaron los términos.  NEWT GINGRICH: BIDEN PUEDE SER PRESIDENTE PERO TRUMP YA ES LÍDER DEL MUNDO LIBRE  El acuerdo se produce tras una serie de victorias legales de Trump y su equipo jurídico, coordinado por el asesor jurídico principal Boris Epshteyn.  La juez federal Tanya Chutkan accedió recientemente a la petición del abogado especial Jack Smith de desestimar su caso contra Trump relacionado con las elecciones de 2020. Smith también desestimó el lunes su apelación en el caso de los registros clasificados, después de que un juez federal desestimara totalmente los cargos en julio, dictaminando que había sido nombrado ilegalmente como abogado especial.  En Nueva York contra Trump, el juez Juan Merchan accedió a la petición de Trumpde presentar una moción para desestimar los cargos derivados del caso del fiscal del distrito de Manhattan, Alvin Bragg, y retiró del calendario la fecha de sentencia del presidente electo.

https://noticias.foxnews.com/live-news/new-jersey-drone-mystery-reported-sightings-live-updates-12-14-2024,Fox News,right,Japan,"Los expertos descartan el pánico ""infundado"" a los drones mientras se informa de avistamientos en Nueva Jersey, Nueva York y otros lugares","Los avistamientos de ""drones"" en el noreste desatan un pánico ""infundado"", según un experto  ​  Un repunte de supuestos avistamientos de drones a lo largo de la Costa Este provocó el viernes una oleada de peticiones de investigación por parte de residentes y legisladores estatales, a pesar de que los funcionarios públicos insisten en que las aeronaves en cuestión vuelan, de hecho, legalmente, y un experto en aviación retirado de la autoridad portuaria dice a Fox News Digital que los temores son exagerados.  Las quejas sobre drones empezaron a llover el mes pasado en Nueva Jersey, donde testigos y residentes empezaron a informar de avistamientos de drones en zonas costeras, incluida Cape May, una pintoresca ciudad situada a las afueras de Atlantic City.  Más recientemente, legisladores de Nueva York, Connecticut, Pensilvania y Maryland han informado de nuevos supuestos avistamientos de drones en sus estados de origen, y algunos testigos alegan que las aeronaves en cuestión han sido del ""tamaño de coches"" o se han visto sobrevolando infraestructuras sensibles o en espacio aéreo restringido.  El teniente detective retirado de la policía de la Autoridad Portuaria John Ryan dijo a Fox News Digital en una entrevista el viernes que el repunte de la actividad se debe probablemente a dos cosas.  La primera, dijo, es que los drones son una tecnología en rápida evolución que ha experimentado un auge tanto en su uso recreativo como comercial en EE.UU. en los últimos 10 años. Los datos federales sobre el registro de drones reflejan este fuerte aumento de su uso, que en su mayor parte, si no en su totalidad, es legal. En octubre de este año, había más de 790.000 drones registrados en la Asociación Federal de Aviación (FAA), y casi 400.000 drones comerciales registrados.  Eso es ""sólo para que te hagas una idea"" de la magnitud del número de drones legales que hay en EE.UU., dijo Ryan, cuya extensa carrera policial incluyó el servicio durante una década como comandante de operaciones especiales del servicio de emergencias del aeropuerto internacional John F. Kennedy de Nueva York y, más tarde, como oficial jefe de la Autoridad Portuaria, cuya función incluye la supervisión de todas las instalaciones de transporte, incluidos Kennedy, LaGuardia y todos los demás aeropuertos y puertos de la zona.  El segundo error, según Ryan , es que las personas en cuestión piden ayuda a las autoridades equivocadas.  ""El error que veo que comete la gente es que acude a las agencias equivocadas y hace estas preguntas"", añadió.  La FAA es el organismo federal encargado de registrar los drones y otras aeronaves estadounidenses. También es el encargado de supervisar el uso recreativo y comercial de drones en EE.UU.  ""En Nueva Jersey, han estado preguntando a FBI, han estado preguntando al Departamento de Seguridad Nacional - han estado preguntando a todo el mundo excepto a la gente a la que deberían preguntar"", dijo Ryan.

El presidente Donald J. Trump obtuvo la pluralidad del voto popular y ganó decisivamente el colegio electoral (312 a 226). Esto ha dado a su segunda presidencia una sensación única de autoridad, de hecho, un mandato del pueblo estadounidense.  La regla del presidente Abraham Lincoln de que con sentimiento popular todo es posible y sin sentimiento popular nada es posible se está confirmando justo delante de nosotros.  Según Rasmussen Reports, el 55% de los votantes estadounidenses creían que las elecciones conferían un mandato claro a las políticas del presidente Trump. Sólo el 32% pensaba que no tenía un mandato (el 13% no estaba seguro).  Esto supone un apoyo de casi 2:1 a un mandato para la agenda Trump entre los que ya se han decidido.  NEWT GINGRICH: BIDEN PUEDE SER PRESIDENTE PERO TRUMP YA ES LÍDER DEL MUNDO LIBRE  El hecho es que: El presidente Trump tiene un programa amplio y creativo para reducir el tamaño del gobierno, recortar los impuestos, aumentar el sueldo neto y resolver una serie de problemas de la nación.  El pueblo estadounidense está de acuerdo en que la antorcha ha pasado de un demócrata liberal cognitivamente en declive y cada vez más pasivo al Presidente electo Trump. El Presidente Trump está llenando el vacío con notable rapidez.  Como escribí recientemente, estamos empezando a ver los primeros efectos del apoyo de la opinión pública a la agenda de Trump y el impulso de la aceptación internacional del presidente Trump como presidente de facto. Algunos demócratas están intentando averiguar cómo responder a los tiempos y a la política cambiantes de nuestra época.  El informe de esta semana de que el senador John Fetterman se inscribió en Truth Social y envió su primera verdad fue una primera señal de que algunos demócratas están abiertos a trabajar con la administración Trump . El demócrata de Pensilvania incluso atacó los casos legales contra el presidente Trump como políticos y pidió al presidente Joe Biden que indultara al nuevo presidente electo.  FETTERMAN DENUNCIA LOS CASOS LEGALES CONTRA TRUMP, HUNTER BIDEN EN SU PRIMER POST DE TRUTH SOCIAL: LOS DOS CASOS ERAN UNA MIERDA  Es posible que el senador Fetterman vaya a llenar el vacío dejado por el senador Joe Manchin, que se jubila, como pensador independiente dispuesto a trabajar con ambos partidos.  La incorporación de Elon Musk y Vivek Ramaswamy al equipo orientado al cambio del Presidente Trumpha añadido un nivel de prestigio y energía que resulta transformador. Tener la oportunidad de reunirse con el hombre más rico del mundo e intercambiar ideas con dos empresarios extraordinarios es una auténtica ruptura con el patrón normalmente aburrido de las reuniones a las que asisten los miembros.  Fue alentador cuando CNN informó el 4 de diciembre:  ""El representante demócrata Jared Moskowitz se unió a un grupo de congresistas liderado por los republicanos en apoyo del recién creado Departamento de Eficiencia Gubernamental, o DOGE, del presidente electo Donald Trump , codirigido por Musk y Vivek Ramaswamy. El representante demócrata Ro Khanna ha dicho que colaborará con Musk en determinados asuntos, y Vermont el senador independiente Bernie Sanders publicó recientemente en X que 'Elon Musk tiene razón'"".  El congresista Khanna representa a gran parte del sector innovador de alta tecnología del norte de California. Tiene un sentido real de hasta qué punto las nuevas tecnologías y el espíritu empresarial pueden modernizar el gobierno y reducir su coste. Escribió un artículo entero titulado ""Los demócratas pueden trabajar con el DOGE"" para MSNBC en el que señalaba cómo se podría hacer que el Pentágono fuera menos caro y más eficaz.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA VER MÁS OPINIONES DE FOX NEWS  Estos primeros indicadores de colaboración potencial pueden convertirse en una auténtica mayoría legislativa bipartidista para la agenda del presidente Trump.  La mayoría de los temas sobre los que hizo campaña el presidente Trump tienen entre un 60% y un 80% de aprobación. Con el púlpito intimidatorio de la Casa Blanca y los activistas de base que fueron una clave importante para que el presidente ganara el 5 de noviembre, puede ser positivo emprender una serie de iniciativas legislativas que atraigan los votos demócratas.  Cuando estaba en el Congreso, participé en dos asombrosos ciclos de victorias bipartidistas para temas conservadores populares.  En 1981, como miembro relativamente nuevo, trabajé en el programa trienal de recortes fiscales del presidente Ronald Reagan. Apelando al pueblo estadounidense y explicando cómo el bill mejoraría sus vidas, se desarrolló suficiente presión popular para conseguir que un tercio de los demócratas de la Cámara votaran con nosotros.  En 1996, como Presidente de la Cámara, aprobamos la reforma de la asistencia social bill , que fue la mayor reforma social conservadora de mi vida. Al hacer hincapié en el requisito del trabajo y reorientar las oficinas de asistencia social para que fueran agencias de ayuda al empleo , conseguimos que aumentara el número de niños que salían de la pobreza más que en ningún otro momento de la historia de EEUU. Aunque la izquierda dura odiaba los requisitos laborales, el apoyo popular a la reforma de la asistencia social (cerca del 90% en una encuesta, incluido el 88% de los que recibían asistencia social) hizo que los demócratas se dividieran por la mitad. Ganamos 101 demócratas y perdimos 101 demócratas.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA OBTENER LA APLICACIÓN FOX NEWS  Una conciliación bill que reduzca los impuestos y reforme la normativa para crear empleo -con tres o cuatro meses de comunicación, educación y organización de base- podría hacer que un número considerable de demócratas decidieran que tenían que apoyar la bill o enfrentarse a una derrota segura.  Existe el potencial para un bipartidismo positivo que reforme el establishment y cree una América mucho más dinámica, segura y próspera.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA LEER MÁS DE NEWT GINGRICH",US,

El presidente electo, que tomará posesión de su cargo en poco más de un mes, compartió un meme generado por IA del ex gobernador de Nueva Jersey comiendo McDonald's con más comidas de McDonald's entregadas por drones, burlándose de su peso en la Verdad Social y X.  Christie apoyó a Trump en 2016, pero más tarde fue destituido como jefe de su equipo de transición.  El año pasado, Christie hizo una efímera campaña presidencial para las elecciones de 2024, durante la cual llamó a Trump ""cobarde"" y ""marioneta de Putin"", pero abandonó en enero.  TRUMP LLEVA EL DRAMA POLÍTICO A LOS BANQUILLOS DEL PARTIDO EJÉRCITO-MARINA  ""Quiero prometerte esto: voy a asegurarme de que en ningún caso permitiré que Donald Trump vuelva a ser presidente de Estados Unidos. Y eso es más importante que mi propia ambición personal"", dijo cuando abandonó.  El peso de Christie ha sido un objetivo frecuente de Trump desde su desencuentro. El año pasado, Trump dijo en broma a un simpatizante que no llamara ""cerdo gordo"" al ex gobernador.

Luigi Mangione fue detenido el lunes tras una persecución y acusado del asesinato de Thompson, cometido a la salida de un hotel de Manhattan la semana pasada. Mangione se ha convertido en un héroe popular para algunas figuras de extrema izquierda que creen que la muerte de Thompson es una merecida reacción contra los gigantes de los seguros médicos, como UnitedHealthcare , que deniegan la cobertura o cobran primas elevadas.  La senadora demócrata por Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren condenó el asesinato esta semana, pero dijo que la muerte de Thompson debería servir también de ""advertencia"".  ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta, pero sólo se puede presionar a la gente hasta cierto punto"", declaró a HuffPost. ""Esta es una advertencia de que si presionas a la gente lo suficiente, pierde la fe en la capacidad de su gobierno para hacer cambios, pierde la fe en la capacidad de las personas que proporcionan la asistencia sanitaria para hacer cambios, y empieza a tomar el asunto en sus propias manos de formas que, en última instancia, serán una amenaza para todos"".  ELIZABETH WARREN DICE QUE EL ASESINATO DE UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO FUE UNA ADVERTENCIA: 'SÓLO SE PUEDE PRESIONAR A LA GENTE HASTA CIERTO PUNTO'  Warren hizo comentarios similares a la presentadora de MSNBC Joy Reid sobre el asesinato de Thompson.  ""La gente está muy enfadada por la asistencia sanitaria, creo que con razón, por negar la asistencia y por todo el sistema... matar a un CEO no es la forma de cambiar"", dijo Reid. ""Hay que regularlos"".  ""Lo diremos una y otra vez"", dijo Warren. ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta. Se juzga a este tipo que supuestamente ha matado al CEO de UnitedHealth[care], pero sólo se puede presionar a la gente hasta cierto punto, y entonces empiezan a tomarse la justicia por su mano.""  Warren se retractó más tarde de sus comentarios a Fox News Digital.  ""La violencia nunca es la respuesta. Punto"", dijo. ""Debería haber sido mucho más clara al decir que nunca hay justificación para el asesinato"".  El periodista Piers Morgan también se enfrentó a la periodista de izquierdas Taylor Lorenz por su aparente simpatía hacia Mangione durante un episodio de ""Piers Morgan Uncensored"" emitido el lunes por la noche. Durante el programa, Lorenz admitió que sentía ""alegría"" por la muerte de Thompson.  Cuando un escandalizado Morgan se enfrentó a Lorenz por sus comentarios, diciendo que Thompson es ""marido y padre"", Lorenz replicó: ""¡También lo son las decenas de miles de estadounidenses que asesinó! También lo son las decenas de miles de estadounidenses, estadounidenses inocentes, que murieron porque ejecutivos codiciosos de seguros sanitarios como éste impulsan una política de negar la asistencia a las personas más vulnerables.""  Más tarde dijo que nunca sintió ""alegría por la muerte de ese hombre"", sino porque más gente está prestando atención a los problemas sistémicos de la sanidad estadounidense.  La copresentadora de ""The View"" Sunny Hostin leyó comentarios la semana pasada burlándose de la muerte de Thompson en las redes sociales, diciendo que la celebración de parte del público estadounidense es ""reflejo de cómo se siente la gente respecto a su asistencia sanitaria"".

""Ambos enviaron mensajes a través de sus violentos asesinatos"", dijo John Kelly, perfilador criminal y presidente de System to Apprehend Lethal Killers. ""El Unabomber envió un mensaje hacia y sobre la industria tecnológica y sobre cómo ésta destruiría el país"".  El caso de Kaczynski fue el primero en el que Kelly trabajó. El Unabomber, FBI abreviatura del terrorista de la universidad y las aerolíneas, envió 16 bombas a lo largo de casi 20 años, incluida una que explotó en un avión tras alcanzar cierta altitud.  LA FAMILIA DEL SOSPECHOSO DE ASESINATO DE UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO SE PREGUNTA QUÉ SABÍA LA POLICÍA DURANTE LA PERSECUCIÓN  ""El sospechoso de UnitedHealthcare envió su mensaje al sector de los seguros, y no creo que fuera el último si no le pillan"", añadió.  Al igual que Kaczynski fabricaba sus propias bombas, el arma sospechosa del asesinato de Thompson contenía piezas caseras impresas en 3D, según Kelly.  La policía la describió como una ""pistola fantasma"" con receptor de plástico y supresor.  UNITED HEALTHCARE CEO EL SOSPECHOSO DE ASESINATO LUIGI MANGIONE SE QUEJÓ DE UNA OPERACIÓN DE ESPALDA ANTES DEL ASESINATO  EX REPORTERO DE LA WAPO DICE 'QUEREMOS A ESTOS EJECUTIVOS MUERTOS' TRAS EL ASESINATO DEL SEGURO CEO  ""Ninguno de los dos tuvo una relación significativa con una mujer"", dijo Kelly. ""Ambos podrían haber sufrido esquizofrenia. Seguro que el Unabomber sí. Luigi está en la edad madura en la que podría empezar"".  Kaczynski se suicidó en prisión el año pasado tras renunciar a someterse a tratamientos contra el cáncer. Cumplía cadena perpetua sin posibilidad de libertad condicional después de que su hermano leyera su manifiesto, enviado anónimamente al Washington Post en 1995 y lo delatara.  Al parecer, Mangione tenía un manifiesto escrito a mano cuando la policía de Altoona, Pensilvania, lo detuvo el lunes. En el manifiesto, supuestamente mencionaba UnitedHealthcare y la conferencia de accionistas a la que Thompson se dirigía en el momento del asesinato.  ""Ambos estaban obsesionados y centrados en industrias a las que querían hacer daño y concienciar a la opinión pública"", dijo Kelly.  SIGUE AL EQUIPO DE FOX TRUE CRIME EN X  Mangione aparecía periódicamente en Goodreads, la red social dedicada a la literatura, donde escribió una reseña de manifiesto de Kaczynski .  ""Es fácil tacharlo rápida e irreflexivamente (sic) de manifiesto de un lunático, para evitar enfrentarse a algunos de los incómodos problemas que identifica"", escribió. ""Pero es sencillamente imposible ignorar lo clarividentes que resultaron muchas de sus predicciones sobre la sociedad moderna"".  Escribiendo sobre ""La sociedad industrial y su futuro"" de Kaczynski, citó otra ""toma online que [le] pareció interesante"".  ""Cuando todas las demás formas de comunicación fracasan, la violencia es necesaria para sobrevivir"", escribió. ""Puede que no te gusten sus métodos, pero viendo las cosas desde su perspectiva, no es terrorismo, es guerra y revolución"".

""Aunque estas acciones tienden a caracterizarse como las de un loco ludita (sic), sin embargo, se ven más exactamente como las de un revolucionario político extremo"".  Ambos hombres se habían recluido antes de sus presuntos crímenes. Kaczynski se mudó a una cabaña remota sin electricidad ni agua corriente para alejarse de la sociedad cada vez más tecnologizada que odiaba. La madre de Mangione denunció su desaparición a la policía de San Francisco el mes pasado, diciéndoles que no había podido ponerse en contacto con su hijo desde julio, según fuentes policiales.

""Es entonces cuando realmente empieza a definir cómo va a ser. Eso es probablemente lo que le hizo empezar a recorrer este camino hacia la violencia. Pero no te engañes pensando que este chico nunca antes pensó así"".  Pero puso en duda que el presunto asesino actuara realmente solo.  ""Quiero ver el historial de llamadas de ese teléfono desechable"", dijo a Fox News Digital. ""Esos sentimientos no empezaron ayer ni hace tres meses. ¿Esos pensamientos internos que tenía? No"".  Al igual que Mangione, Kaczynski era un antiguo miembro de la Ivy Leaguer: licenciado en Harvard y matemático. El Unabomber mató a tres personas e hirió a 23 más entre 1978 y 1995 con una serie de bombas que envió por correo a sus víctimas.  MIRA 'ESCANDALOSO: UNABOMBER' EN FOX NATION  Un vídeo de vigilancia grabado en el exterior de un hotel Hilton del centro de Manhattan muestra a un asesino enmascarado acercándose sigilosamente por detrás a Thompson en la acera hacia las 6.45 horas del 4 de diciembre. Thompson se dirigía a una conferencia de accionistas en el establecimiento que iba a comenzar esa misma mañana, cuando el pistolero abrió fuego por la espalda.  Cuando el CEO se desplomó en la calle, una mujer que presenció el ataque huyó en una dirección y la figura enmascarada se alejó despreocupadamente en la otra. La policía siguió sus movimientos por toda Nueva York hasta una estación de autobuses, de donde salió una hora después del asesinato. Compartieron imágenes de vigilancia, que circularon ampliamente por Internet, y la policía lo detuvo el lunes en un McDonald's de Altoona, Pensilvania, después de que unos testigos lo reconocieran y llamaran al 911.

Su abogado dijo esta semana a un juez que piensa luchar contra la extradición a Nueva York, lo que retrasaría allí un caso de asesinato en segundo grado.  La policía dijo a Fox News que estaban investigando si se le había denegado una reclamación de asistencia sanitaria mientras investigan un posible motivo.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA OBTENER LA APLICACIÓN FOX NEWS  Han alegado que Mangione admitió el delito por escrito y dejó otras pistas, como casquillos de bala con las palabras ""deny"", ""defend"" y ""depose"" y una mochila llena de dinero del Monopoly.  Las notas dejadas en los casquillos de bala han suscitado comparaciones con el libro ""Retrasar, negar, defender: por qué las compañías de seguros no pagan las reclamaciones y qué puedes hacer al respecto"". El libro no aparecía en su cuenta de Goodreads. La policía dijo el miércoles que los casquillos coincidían balísticamente con la pistola incautada durante la detención de Mangione.  ""Sentía simpatía por un individuo, y tenía una causa y supuestamente utilizó la violencia por esa causa"", dijo Parker. ""Se tarda mucho tiempo en desarrollar estos pensamientos. Este tirador tenía la inteligencia y la sofisticación para hacerlo, [una] personalidad de rasgos de alguien dispuesto a llegar a medidas extremas por algo que le apasiona. Creía que estaba defendiendo algo por su causa y su propia identidad: salvar a todas estas personas que habían sido víctimas del sector de los seguros de asistencia sanitaria.""

Escribiendo en su página de Substack el viernes, Moore señaló que no aprueba el asesinato, pero insistió en que la rabia que la gente siente hacia la industria debería amplificarse tras el asesinato de UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.  ""El enfado está justificado al 1000%. Hace tiempo que los medios de comunicación deberían haberlo cubierto. No es algo nuevo. Ha estado hirviendo. Y no voy a calmarla ni a pedir a la gente que se calle. Quiero echar gasolina sobre esa ira"", dijo. También incluyó una subida gratuita a YouTube de su documental de 2007 ""Sicko"", que apunta a las industrias farmacéutica y de seguros médicos estadounidenses.  ""Estas empresas de seguros y sus ejecutivos tienen más sangre en las manos que mil terroristas del 11-S"", añadió. ""Y por eso están borrando los perfiles de sus ejecutivos de sus sitios web y poniendo vallas alrededor de sus sedes"".  EX REPORTERO DE LA WAPO DICE 'QUEREMOS A ESTOS EJECUTIVOS MUERTOS' TRAS EL ASESINATO DE LA ASEGURADORA CEO  Las palabras de Moore se producen casi una semana después de que Luigi Mangione, residente en Maryland y licenciado en la Ivy League, fuera detenido y acusado del asesinato de Thompson a las puertas de un hotel de Manhattan.  El tiroteo provocó una oleada de condena y horror por la matanza, pero también de celebración entre algunos que optaron por la simpatía hacia los estadounidenses que consideran víctimas del sistema sanitario del país.  El artículo de Moore indicaba que estaba en este último bando.  ""En su manifiesto, hace referencia a cómo he 'iluminado la corrupción y la codicia', dando a entender que la gente debería acudir a mi trabajo para comprender la complejidad -y el abuso hambriento de poder- de nuestro sistema actual"", escribió Moore, añadiendo que, desde que se le menciona en el manifiesto del sospechoso, le preguntan constantemente si condena el asesinato de Thompson.  CÓMO EL ARMA DEL PISTOLERO DE UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO PODRÍA JUGAR EN SU CONTRA Y A FAVOR DE LA POLICÍA  ""Hmmm. ¿Condeno el asesinato? Es una pregunta extraña"", escribió. ""En Fahrenheit 9/11, condené el asesinato de cientos de miles de iraquíes inocentes y el asesinato sin sentido de nuestros propios soldados estadounidenses a manos de nuestro gobierno estadounidense"".  Y añadió: ""En mis 35 años como cineasta, ¿he dicho o hecho algo que haya implicado que apruebo el asesinato?"".  Sin embargo, Moore optó por centrar su condena en las empresas sanitarias, afirmando: ""He aquí una triste estadística para ti: En Estados Unidos, tenemos la friolera de 1,4 millones de personas empleadas con el trabajo de NEGAR LA ATENCIÓN SANITARIA, ¡frente a sólo 1 millón de médicos en todo el país!""  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA MÁS COBERTURA DE MEDIOS DE COMUNICACIÓN Y CULTURA  Moore escribió que apoya la ira que la gente ha mostrado hacia las empresas sanitarias desde la muerte de Thompson.  ""Sí, condeno el asesinato, y por eso condeno la industria sanitaria estadounidense, quebrada, vil, rapaz, sanguinaria, poco ética e inmoral, y condeno a cada uno de los directores generales que están a cargo de ella"", declaró.",US,

El único problema para Jackson State fue que hubo una bandera en la jugada.  Entonces, al pitar el penalti, el árbitro Rory Bernard hizo algo insólito.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA VER MÁS COBERTURA DEPORTIVA EN FOXNEWS.COM  ""Me gustaría saludar a nuestros veteranos militares"", dijo Bernard antes de saludar.  El saludo de Bernard provocó los aplausos de la multitud. Tras rendir homenaje a los veteranos militares, Bernard anunció la bandera.  ""Falta personal, rudeza innecesaria, equipo de vuelta, número 11, la penalización de quince yardas se aplicará desde el lugar de la falta, primer down"", dijo Bernard.  EL EJÉRCITO Y LA ARMADA SE ENFRENTAN EN LA 125 REUNIÓN MIENTRAS EL PRESIDENTE ELECTO TRUMP OBSERVA JUNTO A FIGURAS POLÍTICAS CLAVE  Por desgracia para Jackson State y Terrell Jr., el touchdown fue borrado del marcador.  La Celebration Bowl es un enfrentamiento anual entre los campeones de la Southwestern Athletic Conference y la Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.  Jackson State juega su tercera Celebration Bowl en cuatro años, pero aún no ha ganado ninguna, ya que Deion Sanders no pudo ganarla para la escuela antes de marcharse a Colorado.  HAZ CLIC AQUÍ PARA OBTENER LA APLICACIÓN FOX NEWS  Jackson State llegó al partido con un récord de 11-2, y South Carolina State con 9-2. Su encuentro en la Celebration Bowl de este año es el séptimo de la historia entre ambas escuelas, con un balance de 3-3 entre ambos equipos.  Es probable que la muestra de patriotismo de Bernard sea la primera de muchas el sábado, ya que el Ejército y la Marina se enfrentarán por 125ª vez a las 15:00 h ET.  El Presidente electo Donald Trump y el Vicepresidente electo JD Vance asistirán al partido Army-Navy en el estadio Northwest, Landover, Maryland, el sábado por la tarde.
