ユン大統領の職務が停止韓国大統領府によりますとユン・ソンニョル大統領の弾劾の議決書が午後7時24分に国会から大統領府に届き、この時刻をもって大統領の職務が停止されました。大統領の職務はハン・ドクス首相が代行することになります。憲法裁判所 16日午前10時から会議議案が可決されたことを受けて、今後、180日以内に弾劾が妥当かどうかを判断する憲法裁判所は、16日午前10時から裁判官が集まって会議を開き、今後の日程を議論すると明らかにしました。また、裁判官2人を指名して作業チームを作り、迅速かつ公正な裁判を行うとしています。ユン大統領「私は決して諦めない」弾劾を求める議案が可決されたことを受けてユン大統領が国民に向けて談話コメントを発表しました。この中で「私は今しばらく立ち止まるが、この2年半、国民とともに歩んできた未来への旅路は、決して立ち止まってはいけないだろう。私は決して諦めない。私への叱責と激励を心に受け止め、最後の瞬間まで国家のために最善を尽くす」としています。そのうえで「公職者の皆様にお願いする。大統領の職務代行を中心に、みんなが力を合わせて国民の安全と幸福を守るため、最善を尽くしてほしい。また、政界の皆様にお願いする。暴走と対決の政治が熟議と配慮の政治に変わるよう政治文化と制度の改善に努力してほしい」としています。そして「愛する国民の皆様、私は韓国国民の底力を信じる。韓国の自由民主主義と繁栄のために、力を合わせましょう」と結んでいます。最大野党 代表「民主主義が再び勝利した」ユン大統領の弾劾を求める議案が可決されたことを受けて、最大野党「共に民主党」のイ・ジェミョン（李在明）代表がコメントを発表しました。この中では「きょう、韓国の民主主義が再び勝利した。寒さにも負けず1日も欠かさずに弾劾を訴えた国民がいたので、きょうの勝利が可能になった」としています。そのうえで「私たちが国民とともに力を合わせれば、どんな困難も乗りこえることができる。私たちが進む道がまさに韓国の未来だ」としています。職務代行 ハン首相 “国政の安定的運営に全力”今後、大統領の職務を代行することになるハン・ドクス首相は14日午後、外交や安全保障の担当者を含むすべての省庁に対し緊急の指示を出しました。それによりますと、ハン首相は、韓国軍の合同参謀本部議長に対し、北朝鮮が韓国の安全保障がぜい弱な時期だと判断して挑発を試みる可能性があるとして、警戒態勢を強化するよう指示したとしています。さらに外交面では、外相に対し、アメリカとの同盟を基盤にした上で、日本や中国など主要国との緊密な意思疎通を維持することなどを要請したということです。その後、夜に国民向けの談話を発表しました。談話の冒頭、ハン首相は「韓国が直面している現状とそれにいたったすべての過程に重い責任を痛感している」と述べて謝罪しました。そして「いま何より重要なことは国政においてわずかな空白もあってはならないということだ。韓国が直面している内外の環境は非常に困難だ」と述べました。その上で国民への影響を最小限にすること、また強固な安全保障の態勢を確立してアメリカや日本などとの信頼関係を維持することに最善を尽くすと強調しました。さらにハン首相は「国民は団結した力と知恵で困難を克服してきた。今の状況も国民の成熟した民主主義への意識と、政府の責任ある対応を通じて必ず乗りこえることができると信じている」と述べました。ハン首相はさっそく臨時の閣議やNSC＝国家安全保障会議を開き、大統領の職務代行として国政の安定化に努める姿勢を示しています。採決の瞬間 国会では歓声も 高揚感と危機感採決が行われた国会の本会議場前のホールでは、与野党や国会の関係者、それに国内外のメディアなど、数百人が集まり、採決の行方を見守りました。そして、弾劾の議案が可決された瞬間、大きな歓声が上がり、ガッツポーズをする人もみられ、高揚感につつまれました。その直後、弾劾を求め続けた最大野党「共に民主党」の議員が一斉に本会議場から出てきて、幹部は「民主主義の勝利だ」と記者団に話していました。一方で、「共に民主党」の議員は「まだまだ国政は厳しい状況だ。早く国政を安定させなければならない」と、緊張した表情で話していました。これに対して、議案に反対する方針だった与党「国民の力」の議員は、採決のあと、神妙な面持ちで下を向きながら議場をあとにしていました。与党の関係者は「とても悲しい気持ちだ。与党内でも意見が割れていて、今後、与党が分裂しかねない」と、危機感を示していました。採決のあとも大勢の人が国会に残っていて、弾劾の結論を出した国会がどのように混乱が続く政治と向き合うのか、関心が高まっています。石破首相 “引き続き緊密に意思疎通の努力を”石破総理大臣は、弾劾を求める議案が可決される前に訪問先の福島県大熊町で記者団から日韓関係への影響などを問われ「他国の内政の話であり日本政府としてのコメントは差し控えたいが、この事態については政府しても私自身としても特段かつ重大な関心を持って注視している」と述べました。そのうえで「韓国は国際社会のさまざな課題にパートナーとして協力すべき重要な隣国であり日韓関係の重要性は何ら変わるものではない。推移はまったく見通せないが、引き続き緊密に意思疎通をしていかなければならず、そのためのあらゆる努力をしたい」と述べました。外務省 韓国担当部署の幹部ら採決の行方見守る外務省では、韓国を担当する部署の幹部や職員が出勤して情報収集を行うとともに採決の行方を見守っていました。外務省幹部はNHKの取材に対し「現地からの報告や報道から、ある程度予想されていた結果だ。今後の韓国政府の様子や弾劾の手続きの行方を見守りたい。今後の展開もさまざまなパターンが想定されるので、予断を持たずに情報収集を行っていく」と述べました。そのうえで「外交当局間の意思疎通はさまざまなレベルで行ってきているが、今後も継続し、地域の安全保障に影響が出ないようにしたい。来年の国交正常化60年に向けて、事務的に準備を進めるつもりだが、韓国側の混乱が続く可能性もあり、先行きは不透明だ」と述べました。政府関係者 “改善の日韓関係 悪影響が危惧”政府関係者はNHKの取材に対し「改善してきた日韓関係への悪影響が危惧される。今後、日本に厳しい立場を取る野党の代表が大統領となる可能性が十分にあり、そうなれば慰安婦問題などの懸案に関してゴールポストを動かすようなことをされてしまうかもしれない。両国関係が根本的に悪化すればビジネス面にも影響が出かねない。日本政府としては事態を注視しながら対応していく」と述べました。また、別の政府関係者はNHKの取材に対し「もう一段、緊迫の度合いが高まったと受け止めている。日韓関係が改善されてきていただけに、どのような影響があるかも含め状況を見守るほかはない」と述べました。2回目の弾劾求める議案の内容はユン大統領の弾劾を求める2回目の議案では、ユン大統領による「非常戒厳」が憲法に違反し、内乱罪にあたるとしています。具体的には「憲法機関である中央選挙管理委員会に違法に侵入しただけでなく、国会議員、政治家、言論人などの不法逮捕を試みた」と指摘しています。さらに「国憲を乱す目的でその要件と手続きに違反して非常戒厳を宣布し、武装した軍と警察を動員して国会に侵入するなど、国会と国民を脅迫し暴行する一連の暴動を起こすことで大韓民国全域の平穏を害する内乱罪を犯した」としています。そして「非常戒厳が宣言される前まで国家非常事態と見られるいかなる異常兆候も見られず、必ず『兵力をもって』これに応じなければならなかったいかなる状況もなかった。非常戒厳宣言は憲法と法律が定めた実体的要件を備えていない」としています。一方で、ユン大統領が「日本中心の奇異な外交政策に固執した」などとする記述は、2回目の議案には入りませんでした。韓国メディアは、国会審議で行われた関係者の証言やユン大統領の国民向けの談話などをもとに「1回目の議案よりも違憲・違法行為をさらに具体的に盛り込み、弾劾の法的な理論を補強している」と伝えています。大統領の弾劾 過去には韓国の国会では、大統領の弾劾を求める議案が可決されたことがあります。2004年には、当時のノ・ムヒョン（盧武鉉）大統領が、大統領選挙をめぐる側近らによる不正資金事件の責任などを理由に、弾劾の議案を可決され、職務を停止されました。しかし、憲法裁判所は、「罷免する重大な職務上の違反には当たらない」として、棄却し、ノ大統領は職務停止からおよそ2か月で大統領職に復帰しました。2016年には、当時のパク・クネ大統領が、知人による大統領府高官の人事への介入などを理由に、弾劾の議案を可決され、職務を停止されました。2017年、憲法裁判所は弾劾を妥当とする決定を言い渡し、パク大統領は韓国の大統領として初めて、罷免されました。弾劾めぐる手続きは韓国では、大統領の弾劾を求める議案が国会で可決されると、大統領は職務を停止されます。その場合は首相が大統領の職務を代行します。韓国メディアによりますと、弾劾の議案が可決されたあと、その議決書が大統領府に届けられると、大統領の職務が停止されるということです。有力紙「東亜日報」は2016年に当時のパク・クネ大統領の弾劾議案が可決された際には、可決からおよそ3時間後に議決書が大統領府に届けられ、職務が停止されたと伝えています。大統領の弾劾を求める議案が国会で可決されると、憲法裁判所が弾劾が妥当かどうかを審理して、180日以内に最終的な決定を言い渡します。韓国メディアによりますと、2004年に国会で弾劾の議案が可決された当時のノ・ムヒョン大統領の場合、可決から憲法裁判所が弾劾は妥当ではないとして棄却するまでに63日かかりました。また、2016年に弾劾議案が可決された当時のパク・クネ大統領の場合、可決から憲法裁判所が弾劾は妥当と決定するまでに91日かかったということです。憲法裁判所では、裁判官9人のうち6人以上が妥当と判断すれば、大統領は罷免され、60日以内に大統領選挙が行われることになります。一方で、憲法裁判所は裁判官3人が退任したあと、空席のままで現在6人しかいませんが、韓国メディアは6人のままでも全員が妥当と判断すれば、弾劾が決定されると伝えています。,Japan,,0.4551927149295807,0.4859086275100708,0.0588986836373806,,,,-0.3962940312922001

ハン首相 “国政の安定的運営に全力”今後、大統領の職務を代行することになるハン・ドクス首相は14日午後、外交や安全保障の担当者を含むすべての省庁に対し緊急の指示を出しました。それによりますと、ハン首相は、韓国軍の合同参謀本部議長に対し、北朝鮮が韓国の安全保障がぜい弱な時期だと判断して挑発を試みる可能性があるとして、警戒態勢を強化するよう指示したとしています。さらに外交面では、外相に対し、アメリカとの同盟を基盤にした上で、日本や中国など主要国との緊密な意思疎通を維持することなどを要請したということです。その後、夜に国民向けの談話を発表しました。談話の冒頭、ハン首相は「韓国が直面している現状とそれにいたったすべての過程に重い責任を痛感している」と述べて謝罪しました。そして「いま何より重要なことは国政においてわずかな空白もあってはならないということだ。韓国が直面している内外の環境は非常に困難だ」と述べました。その上で国民への影響を最小限にすること、また強固な安全保障の態勢を確立してアメリカや日本などとの信頼関係を維持することに最善を尽くすと強調しました。さらにハン首相は「国民は団結した力と知恵で困難を克服してきた。今の状況も国民の成熟した民主主義への意識と、政府の責任ある対応を通じて必ず乗りこえることができると信じている」と述べました。ハン首相はさっそく臨時の閣議やNSC＝国家安全保障会議を開き、大統領の職務代行として国政の安定化に努める姿勢を示しています。採決の瞬間 国会では歓声も 高揚感と危機感採決が行われた国会の本会議場前のホールでは、与野党や国会の関係者、それに国内外のメディアなど、数百人が集まり、採決の行方を見守りました。そして、弾劾の議案が可決された瞬間、大きな歓声が上がり、ガッツポーズをする人もみられ、高揚感につつまれました。その直後、弾劾を求め続けた最大野党「共に民主党」の議員が一斉に本会議場から出てきて、幹部は「民主主義の勝利だ」と記者団に話していました。一方で、「共に民主党」の議員は「まだまだ国政は厳しい状況だ。早く国政を安定させなければならない」と、緊張した表情で話していました。これに対して、議案に反対する方針だった与党「国民の力」の議員は、採決のあと、神妙な面持ちで下を向きながら議場をあとにしていました。与党の関係者は「とても悲しい気持ちだ。与党内でも意見が割れていて、今後、与党が分裂しかねない」と、危機感を示していました。採決のあとも大勢の人が国会に残っていて、弾劾の結論を出した国会がどのように混乱が続く政治と向き合うのか、関心が高まっています。石破首相 “引き続き緊密に意思疎通の努力を”石破総理大臣は、弾劾を求める議案が可決される前に訪問先の福島県大熊町で記者団から日韓関係への影響などを問われ「他国の内政の話であり日本政府としてのコメントは差し控えたいが、この事態については政府しても私自身としても特段かつ重大な関心を持って注視している」と述べました。そのうえで「韓国は国際社会のさまざな課題にパートナーとして協力すべき重要な隣国であり日韓関係の重要性は何ら変わるものではない。推移はまったく見通せないが、引き続き緊密に意思疎通をしていかなければならず、そのためのあらゆる努力をしたい」と述べました。外務省 韓国担当部署の幹部ら採決の行方見守る外務省では、韓国を担当する部署の幹部や職員が出勤して情報収集を行うとともに採決の行方を見守っていました。外務省幹部はNHKの取材に対し「現地からの報告や報道から、ある程度予想されていた結果だ。今後の韓国政府の様子や弾劾の手続きの行方を見守りたい。今後の展開もさまざまなパターンが想定されるので、予断を持たずに情報収集を行っていく」と述べました。そのうえで「外交当局間の意思疎通はさまざまなレベルで行ってきているが、今後も継続し、地域の安全保障に影響が出ないようにしたい。来年の国交正常化60年に向けて、事務的に準備を進めるつもりだが、韓国側の混乱が続く可能性もあり、先行きは不透明だ」と述べました。政府関係者 “改善の日韓関係 悪影響が危惧”政府関係者はNHKの取材に対し「改善してきた日韓関係への悪影響が危惧される。今後、日本に厳しい立場を取る野党の代表が大統領となる可能性が十分にあり、そうなれば慰安婦問題などの懸案に関してゴールポストを動かすようなことをされてしまうかもしれない。両国関係が根本的に悪化すればビジネス面にも影響が出かねない。日本政府としては事態を注視しながら対応していく」と述べました。また、別の政府関係者はNHKの取材に対し「もう一段、緊迫の度合いが高まったと受け止めている。日韓関係が改善されてきていただけに、どのような影響があるかも含め状況を見守るほかはない」と述べました。2回目の弾劾求める議案の内容はユン大統領の弾劾を求める2回目の議案では、ユン大統領による「非常戒厳」が憲法に違反し、内乱罪にあたるとしています。具体的には「憲法機関である中央選挙管理委員会に違法に侵入しただけでなく、国会議員、政治家、言論人などの不法逮捕を試みた」と指摘しています。さらに「国憲を乱す目的でその要件と手続きに違反して非常戒厳を宣布し、武装した軍と警察を動員して国会に侵入するなど、国会と国民を脅迫し暴行する一連の暴動を起こすことで大韓民国全域の平穏を害する内乱罪を犯した」としています。そして「非常戒厳が宣言される前まで国家非常事態と見られるいかなる異常兆候も見られず、必ず『兵力をもって』これに応じなければならなかったいかなる状況もなかった。非常戒厳宣言は憲法と法律が定めた実体的要件を備えていない」としています。一方で、ユン大統領が「日本中心の奇異な外交政策に固執した」などとする記述は、2回目の議案には入りませんでした。韓国メディアは、国会審議で行われた関係者の証言やユン大統領の国民向けの談話などをもとに「1回目の議案よりも違憲・違法行為をさらに具体的に盛り込み、弾劾の法的な理論を補強している」と伝えています。大統領の弾劾 過去には韓国の国会では、大統領の弾劾を求める議案が可決されたことがあります。2004年には、当時のノ・ムヒョン（盧武鉉）大統領が、大統領選挙をめぐる側近らによる不正資金事件の責任などを理由に、弾劾の議案を可決され、職務を停止されました。しかし、憲法裁判所は、「罷免する重大な職務上の違反には当たらない」として、棄却し、ノ大統領は職務停止からおよそ2か月で大統領職に復帰しました。2016年には、当時のパク・クネ大統領が、知人による大統領府高官の人事への介入などを理由に、弾劾の議案を可決され、職務を停止されました。2017年、憲法裁判所は弾劾を妥当とする決定を言い渡し、パク大統領は韓国の大統領として初めて、罷免されました。弾劾めぐる手続きは韓国では、大統領の弾劾を求める議案が国会で可決されると、大統領は職務を停止されます。その場合は首相が大統領の職務を代行します。韓国メディアによりますと、弾劾の議案が可決されたあと、その議決書が大統領府に届けられると、大統領の職務が停止されるということです。有力紙「東亜日報」は2016年に当時のパク・クネ大統領の弾劾議案が可決された際には、可決からおよそ3時間後に議決書が大統領府に届けられ、職務が停止されたと伝えています。大統領の弾劾を求める議案が国会で可決されると、憲法裁判所が弾劾が妥当かどうかを審理して、180日以内に最終的な決定を言い渡します。韓国メディアによりますと、2004年に国会で弾劾の議案が可決された当時のノ・ムヒョン大統領の場合、可決から憲法裁判所が弾劾は妥当ではないとして棄却するまでに63日かかりました。また、2016年に弾劾議案が可決された当時のパク・クネ大統領の場合、可決から憲法裁判所が弾劾は妥当と決定するまでに91日かかったということです。憲法裁判所では、裁判官9人のうち6人以上が妥当と判断すれば、大統領は罷免され、60日以内に大統領選挙が行われることになります。一方で、憲法裁判所は裁判官3人が退任したあと、空席のままで現在6人しかいませんが、韓国メディアは6人のままでも全員が妥当と判断すれば、弾劾が決定されると伝えています。,Japan,,0.4551927149295807,0.4859086275100708,0.0588986836373806,,,,-0.3962940312922001

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/us/drone-sightings-new-jersey-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"New York CNN —  Federal agencies are facing intense pressure to give the public more details on unexplained drone sightings in the New York City metropolitan area and beyond that have been going on for weeks over residential neighborhoods as well as restricted sites and critical infrastructure.  On Saturday, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey posted on X about the “growing number of drone sightings” there, making her state the latest to report such sightings, joining New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.  Federal officials have sought to calm the concerns about the sightings, but without giving further details about what they might be. They say there’s no evidence of a public safety threat, and many of the reported sightings are cases of mistaken identity.  “The bottom line is this: They’re not providing enough information to the public, and the public is concerned,” US Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Friday. “Believe me, I’m hearing from my constituents about this all the time, and I think it’s time for them to immediately get out there and brief.”  A drone sighting prompted the temporary closure of runways at New York’s Stewart International Airport on Friday night, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the Orange County airport about 70 miles north of New York City.  There were no impacts to the airport’s flight operations during the closure, which lasted about an hour, according to the Port Authority, which was alerted to the sighting by the Federal Aviation Administration.  “This has gone too far,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement Saturday, adding that last month she “directed the New York State Intelligence Center to actively investigate drone sightings and coordinate with federal law enforcement to address this issue.”  Earlier Friday, New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis called the response to the sightings “outrageous,” saying there are “drones and unmanned aerial systems flying above us and our government is not telling us who’s operating them and for what purpose?”  Malliotakis joined Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella in demanding answers.  Fossella said the drones, often seen flying at night, have been spotted hovering over critical infrastructures including Port Liberty New York near the Goethals Bridge, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and Fort Wadsworth, one of the oldest military installations in the country.  Representatives of the federal agencies investigating the drones who have briefed local officials behind closed doors said the drones sometimes appear to fly in a coordinated pattern and can sometimes be in flight for up to six hours, according to Montvale, New Jersey, Mayor Mike Ghassali.  And though federal officials have said there is no evidence the drone sightings pose a public safety threat, Belleville, New Jersey, Mayor Michael Melham has said he has received guidance police should call the county bomb squad if they encounter a downed drone.  In addition, local fire departments should wear hazmat suits when they respond, Melham said, saying the information was shared by his Office of Emergency Management following recent state-level meetings.  “We just don’t know what these things are, so we are being cautious,” Melham said.  Skepticism over government response  One New Jersey lawmaker is accusing federal officials of lying about the presence and purpose of the mysterious drones.  “They’re lying. That’s the long and the short of it,” Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson said in an interview Saturday with CNN’s Victor Blackwell.  Like several other officials and lawmakers, Peterson said he’s personally seen drones hovering near his rural New Jersey home, where he said the absence of street lights and nearby flight paths allows for clear visibility.  Peterson referenced the government’s response to the Chinese spy balloon that traversed over parts of the United States in 2023 to illustrate his point that the government is either embarrassed or unwilling to disclose the truth about the mystery drones due to security concerns.  “Why would you lie? Either because the reason that this is happening is incredibly embarrassing to the administration or it’s an incredibly high security risk for the country and they don’t want to tell us,” he said.  President-elect Donald Trump, meanwhile, has called on the Biden administration to either release any information it has about the mysterious sightings or shoot the drones out of the sky.  “Mystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government’s knowledge. I don’t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!! DJT,” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Friday his agency knows of “no threat or of any nefarious activity” related to the sightings.  Mayorkas pledged to be transparent “if we learn of any cause for concern.”  Officials are currently prioritizing the use of sophisticated radio frequency technology that can geolocate the operator of a drone, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.  There are multiple technical capabilities authorities can use to try and “defeat” a drone, including jamming a signal, disconnecting it from the operator or remotely “hijack” a drone but every option can pose numerous risks, the source said.  “Blowing it out of the sky is the last resort,” the source said, noting the option is always on the table if an aircraft presents a threat.  Federal and state officials said using offensive techniques to bring down the drones poses an unnecessary risk to people on the ground and legal challenges, especially as they have not been deemed threatening, the source said.  New Jersey’s Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has formally requested additional resources from the Biden administration to better address the ongoing situation.  “While I am sincerely grateful for your administration’s leadership in addressing this concerning issue, it has become apparent that more resources are needed to fully understand what is behind this activity,” Murphy said in a letter dated Thursday.  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.  Murphy’s concerns come as Naval Weapons Station Earle, a US Navy base south of Middletown, New Jersey, acknowledged Friday it had spotted “several instances of unidentified drones entering the airspace” above the facility despite no direct threats being identified.  “The base remains prepared to respond to any potential risks, leveraging robust security measures and advanced detection capabilities,” station spokesperson Bill Addison said in an email to CNN, adding there are airspace restrictions above the station.  The energy company PSEG on Saturday said it has “contacted the appropriate authorities” about reports of drones flying over its Salem and Hope Creek nuclear power plants in New Jersey.  Democratic Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey posted videos to his X account showing what appeared to be a cluster of drones over the Round Valley Reservoir Thursday night.  “This has gone on for weeks,” Kim wrote. “It’s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren’t able to track these devices to determine origin and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and counter measures.”  Last night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here’s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn — Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024  Morris County, about 30 miles west of New York City, issued a statement calling for “the federal government to marshal all federal resources at its disposal, including the military, to end the unauthorized flight of drones over our county and other parts of New Jersey.”  “Morris County and our communities have deployed considerable resources daily since the first drones were spotted,” the statement continued.  The Somerset County Sheriff’s Office similarly said in a Facebook post they had “increased vigilance” at sensitive locations and “are analyzing data and information on a daily basis.”  New York State Police said Friday afternoon in a post on X they had received “numerous reports of drone sightings over the past 24 hours” and they were investigating the reports. “We have no evidence at this time that any of the reported sightings pose a public safety threat,” reads the post.  Connecticut State Police announced Friday they have deployed a drone detection system to assist in investigative efforts into unauthorized drone sightings reported over Fairfield County.  “It’s very unsettling to public safety and security, both here in Fairfield and elsewhere,” Republican state Sen. Tony Hwang said in a statement Friday.  “What we have is a lack of information at all levels of government. It’s really a breakdown of communication. Without that vital communication, you lose the public’s confidence, you get speculation and you get fear,” he said.  And in Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro said his administration is “aware of” the reported drone sightings and is taking them seriously. The Democratic governor said Friday evening he directed the Pennsylvania State Police to look further into the sightings, and police will be flying helicopters to try to “determine where these drones are originating from and what the purpose of these drones are.”  White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby, in a press briefing Thursday, said there was “no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus.”  Kirby added many of “the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully.”  Mayorkas echoed Kirby’s explanation Friday, telling CNN some reported drone sightings were cases of “mistaken identity.”  Addressing calls to shoot down unidentified drones, he said, “It’s not as though anyone can just take down a drone in the sky. That in and of itself would be dangerous.”  Mayorkas added he has been in communication with New Jersey’s governor daily.  Congress briefed on drone sightings  Officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI briefed top committees in the House and Senate as well as a delegation of New Jersey lawmakers on the reported drone sightings, a source familiar with the situation tells CNN. The source said while there have been eyewitness reports of what appear to be drones over New Jersey, agency officials stressed in meetings Thursday many videos on social media appear to be civilian airplanes or helicopters.  “I don’t believe with all of these sightings, none of them are drones,” Gottheimer said, adding, “You can’t have the Wild West of drones out there,” with unmanned aircraft threatening infrastructure.  The New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness said there was “an active federal investigation” into the drone sightings, but elected officials want to hear more.  “We should be doing smart intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” US Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who sits on the Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said Thursday. “They should be shot down, if necessary, because they’re flying over sensitive areas.”  Residents in New York’s Rockland County reported drone sightings starting as early as November.  County Executive Ed Day sent a letter to President Joe Biden Friday seeking answers and urging his administration, along with the FAA and FBI, to investigate and provide clarity on the matter.  “The fact that this issue has persisted for weeks without clear answers is completely unacceptable — not just to the people of Rockland County, but to communities across the nation,” Day said in the letter. “It’s time for the Federal government to step up, take responsibility, and provide the answers we all deserve.”  Malliotakis said the situation “is creating havoc, people are confused, they’re concerned, they have anxiety, they don’t know what’s going on.”  No foreign involvement suspected by feds  The US intelligence community and federal law enforcement do not suspect foreign involvement in the drone sightings across New Jersey, security officials told members of Congress Thursday at one private briefing.  Key lawmakers assigned to congressional national security committees were told investigators do not currently believe the sightings involved an overseas connection, the use of foreign drones, nor an operator on the ground connected to a foreign government, according to a source familiar with the briefing conducted by representatives from the FBI, FAA and the Department of Homeland Security.  Officials said sighted drones have been observed with FAA-required anticollision lights and are not believed to have entered any restricted airspaces, according to the source.  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, New Jersey, on Dec. 5. Brian Glenn/TMX/AP  While authorities have not yet identified the origin of the mysterious drone flights, the source said an active FBI investigation remains underway to identify the person or persons operating them, and to determine whether any criminal violations of law have occurred.  Some of the more recent drone operations may be from copycats trying to play on people’s worries as the sightings get more news coverage, former FBI supervisory special agent Tom Adams told CNN. He said there are often innocent explanations, as well.  “I can tell you from my firsthand experience conducting operations for the FBI, as well as investigations into the suspected sighting of drones at critical infrastructure, it was fairly common for planets, crewed aircraft and even low Earth orbit satellites to be misidentified as drones at night,” Adams said.  Drones – unmanned aerial vehicles – are widely owned across the US. A total of 791,597 drones are registered with the FAA, split almost evenly between commercial drones and recreational drones.  Although the drones often display flashing lights, they frequently turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday.  The FAA issued temporary flight restrictions over the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster after drones were spotted in those areas, one week after the FAA received its first report of an unauthorized drone operation in the New York metro area on November 18.  “Until you know the origin and what these drones’ intent is, how can you tell me there’s no imminent threat?” Mayor Tony Perry of Middletown, New Jersey, told CNN Thursday.  Feds rarely coordinate drone info with locals  The sense that local officials are being left in the dark is partially a result of outdated laws keeping regulation of the skies entirely in federal hands, according to the chief executive of a company tracking unauthorized drone flights.  “The laws that regulate aircraft are not built to empower police to deal with the drones,” Axon CEO Rick Smith told CNN News Central Friday, “so if your local state fair has a drone coming towards it that police believe might be dangerous, right now there’s nothing they can do about it.”  Hochul, the Democratic New York governor, called on Congress to pass the Counter-UAS Authority Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act, which she said would give state and local authorities more power in dealing with unmanned aircraft systems and strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones.  The governor said that until these “powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden Administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  FAA regulations allow operators of recreational drones to fly up to 400 feet above the ground in airspace not controlled by FAA air traffic controllers. The FAA does grant waivers on a case-by-case basis to those wanting to operate drones in more congested airspace or at higher altitudes.  Giving local law enforcement more authority over drones is under consideration, Smith said, because traditional aircraft tracking technology is ineffective for vehicles hovering only a few hundred feet off the ground.  “The same radar and tracking system you use for a 747 just doesn’t work,” said Smith.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process with the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items which may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  FBI: San Francisco police recognized suspect  On Friday, the FBI told CNN they received a tip from the San Francisco Police Department, saying an officer with the department’s Special Victims Unit had recognized Mangione as a possible suspect on December 5 after seeing the surveillance photos of the suspect’s unmasked face.  The San Francisco Chronicle first reported on the tip Thursday.  Chronicle reporter Megan Cassidy told CNN’s John Berman her team reported “a few days ago” on the existence of a missing persons report in San Francisco for Mangione.  “Apparently, there was somebody at SFPD that was looking into the missing persons case, and after the shooting of Brian Thompson, recognized this person and called in this tip, or emailed this tip, to the FBI,” Cassidy said.  The FBI then sent the tip to New York investigators during the manhunt, the agency told CNN.  CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explained on Friday’s “AC360” how the tip ultimately made its way to the FBI in New York and the NYPD.  “This tip comes from, I think, a victim witness specialist in the San Francisco Police Department who had that missing persons case somewhere in front of them and looked at that face and says, ‘Gee, that could be the guy that is on these FBI posters all over town,’ so SFPD sends that to San Francisco FBI,” Miller said.  “San Francisco FBI says, ‘that’s a New York office case,’” he added.  Miller explained the FBI’s New York office likely sent the information to a violent crimes squad composed of a mix of FBI agents and NYPD officers.  “They look at it and they do a workup on the name, checking, you know, any indicators that guy’s been in New York, and then they send it over to NYPD,” Miller said.  By Sunday, the tip joined 200 viable leads being examined by authorities, according to Miller.  “Then Monday morning, at 9:15 in the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, another tip leads to the capture,” he said. “So you see, these leads are piling up, being tasked out and being worked, and this was in that pile coming up because it was a viable lead. It’s just that destiny took a hand quicker.”  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.",US,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,,,,0.13,0.828,0.042,-0.9995

CNN —  I’m not much of a hugger. Sure, I’ll bust out the warm fuzzies for relatives around the holidays but I’m not like, say, my best friend, who prefers her hugs to produce the bone-liquifying pressure of an industrial vise. My husband loves to tell the story of our first date, when he approached me with open arms and I maneuvered him into a firm, businesslike handshake. Touch is just not my love language! And if you’re also not a hugger, the holidays are a gauntlet of outstretched arms and sweatered bosoms and unfamiliar colognes. We’ll make it through together! I recently watched some interviews with the lead actresses of the new “Wicked” film (which is sooo so good), and each tends to clutch the other’s single beautifully taloned finger when things get deep. I do that too! It is emotionally supportive without being suffocating (literally or figuratively). Fingertip-to-fingertip touching is the new hugging, pass it on.  Here’s all the good things that happened this week.  Nana Kyei  1. The Friendship Queen Diaries  It’s like something out of a movie: Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in 1996. Now, she’s a queen in Ghana. Despite her challenging youth, Johnson made sure she and her daughter were well-traveled, and after discovering she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, she founded a travel company to organize trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Her work attracted the attention of the Dakpema, a governing body in northern Ghana. She was blown away when they asked her to accept the title of “Zosimli Naa,” or “Friendship Queen.” The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the centuries-old Dagbon Kingdom, which comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in the city of Tamale, where she now lives. “We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.  CNN  2. Fabric of rebirth  The iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is finally open to the public again after a devastating fire damaged it five years ago. As part of this rebirth, fashion designer and artist Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was asked to create new vestments, or special service garments, for the cathedral’s clergy. Vestments are an important part of a church’s identity and de Castelbajac said the theme for the new look was “noble simplicity.” The designer drew inspiration from Notre Dame’s stained glass and blonde stone, creating a look that he said speaks to tradition and innovation; old and new. The vision was “radiant with color, radiant of hope, radiant of faith,” de Castelbajac told CNN. You can see details of the vestments in the photo above, and learn more about de Castelbajac’s process in this video.  CNN  3. Music on the brain  If you’ve ever shared your life with someone with dementia or another progressive neurological disease, you know music can be magic. Toronto-based company LUCID is combining facial mapping software, artificial intelligence, and music to create a therapy for older patients dealing with health challenges like Alzheimer’s, dementia and even depression and anxiety. The treatment involves measuring how a person’s brain reacts to music and combining that with facial mapping and artificial intelligence. Using this data, the technology can create specific playlists that hopefully can alleviate stress, restlessness, confusion and emotional discomfort in dementia patients.  Natalia Botero-Acosta  4. I would swim 500 miles  This whale puts The Proclaimers to shame! A male humpback whale has completed an extraordinary record-breaking migration, swimming more than 8,000 miles from South America to Africa. The humpback was first spotted off the coast of Colombia in 2013 and seen again a few years later not far from its original location. But in 2022, the whale was unexpectedly detected in the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa. The typical migration route for humpback whales can approach 5,000 miles in a single direction, making this one’s journey close to two times that of most whales. The discovery also marks the first documentation of an adult male humpback traveling between the Pacific and Indian oceans.  Video Ad Feedback This Saudi dish transports you to the desert 02:31 - Source: CNN  5. The power of good food  Hadeel Al Motawa knows that food can be so much more than simple sustenance. She co-founded the award-winning restaurant Takya, located in the 600-year-old historic center of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. Though the food has all the artfully prepared aura of a high-class restaurant, the menu is inspired by the traditional home cooking Al Motawa grew up with, and by her travels around Saudi Arabia and abroad. After seeing the deep connection between food and culture, Al Motawa wanted to “bring that same connection back home, to create a space where people could rediscover the beauty of Saudi cuisine.” Saudi Arabia itself is a country of great geographical, and thus culinary, diversity. For example, the Eastern Province is known for its seafood, such as Muhammar, a fried fish dish made with rice and sugar that was traditionally popular among sailors. In the country’s northern region, where temperatures are cooler and may drop below freezing during winter, traditional recipes focus on grains and meat, like the popular jareesh, a lamb stew made with wheat and yogurt.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/crystal-mangum-duke-lacrosse-allegations/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"CNN —  More than 18 years after accusing three former Duke University lacrosse players of raping her, a falsified account she shared in graphic detail, Crystal Mangum has admitted she lied about the encounter.  In an interview on a web show published Wednesday, Mangum apologized to the men and said her relationship with God has made her understand why she fabricated the story. Mangum is serving time in prison on a second-degree murder conviction for killing her boyfriend.  The timeline of the North Carolina case begins in 2006, when Mangum said she was trapped inside a bathroom, sexually assaulted and raped by David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann at a team party where she was performing as an exotic dancer. The men were arrested following her allegations.  “I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn’t, and that was wrong. And I betrayed the trust of a lot of other people who believed in me,” Mangum said on Katerena DePasquale’s show, “Let’s Talk with Kat.” “I made up a story that wasn’t true because I wanted validation from people and not from God.”  David Evans, left, Collin Finnerty, center, and Reade Seligmann, right, look on during a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2007. Chuck Burton/AP/File  For more than a year, the school and the lacrosse players were thrust into a media frenzy, subjected to intense public scrutiny and damaging allegations of sexual assault that were ultimately dropped.  After Mangum’s confession, Duke told CNN on Friday it would not comment. The former players did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.  Here’s how the events unfolded.  A timeline of the events  • March 13, 2006: Mangum is hired as a dancer for a private party held by members of the Duke men’s lacrosse team. It takes place at a house on North Buchanan Boulevard in Durham. Mangum later accuses several players of raping her during the party early on March 14.  • March 28, 2006: Duke President Richard Brodhead suspends team play for the men’s lacrosse team, a move widely criticized as premature since no formal charges had been made yet. Media attention intensifies, with early reports painting a picture of privileged, White lacrosse players being accused by a Black woman. The case becomes a flashpoint for issues of race, class and privilege, according to the Washington Post.  • March 28-30, 2006: DNA tests on Mangum’s body fail to link any of the lacrosse players to the scene, according to a disciplinary order against prosecutor Mike Nifong by the North Carolina State Bar, but Nifong insists on moving forward with the case. Skepticism about the case begins to mount.  • April 18, 2006: Nifong formally charges Seligmann and Finnerty with rape, according to the disciplinary order. The charges are based largely on Mangum’s testimony, as forensic evidence was either inconclusive or absent.  • May 15, 2006: Nifong formally charges Evans with rape, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 5, 2006: Duke announces the lacrosse team is reinstated to play in the following fall, but public sentiment has already soured.  • December 28, 2006: Nifong is accused of withholding evidence and making misleading statements to the press, leading to an investigation by the state bar, according to the disciplinary order.  • April 11, 2007: Roy Cooper – then the state’s Attorney General and now its governor – announces “there is insufficient evidence to proceed on any of the charges” in a statement shared by Duke Athletics. The charges are dropped.  “We believe that these cases were the result of a tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations,” Cooper said. “Based on the significant inconsistencies between the evidence and the various accounts given by the accusing witness, we believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges.”  • June 16, 2007: Nifong loses his law license following disciplinary hearings about his handling of the case, including accusations of ethical misconduct and withholding evidence. His disbarment is finalized by the state bar in July, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 18, 2007: Duke announces that it has settled with the three lacrosse players, agreeing to pay a confidential settlement.  “It is impossible to fully describe what we, our families and team endured. As we said from day one, we are innocent,” Evans, Finnerty and Seligmann said in a statement. “But it took three hundred and ninety-four days, and the intervention of the North Carolina Attorney General, before our innocence was formally declared.”  • October 5, 2007: The three players file a civil lawsuit against the city of Durham, Nifong and other individuals, according to court documents. Durham later settles the lawsuit in part with a one-time grant of $50,000 to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.  • April 3, 2011: Mangum is charged with stabbing her boyfriend, leading to a lengthy criminal trial, and is convicted of second-degree murder in 2013.  ‘I hope they can forgive me’  Mangum has spent 11 years in prison, which she is getting through by reading the Bible and finding humor in her thoughts, she said in her interview with “Let’s Talk with Kat.”  She wishes she could help children who were sexually abused, she told DePasquale. When asked if she could describe her experience in prison in one word, she says: “Growth.”  Before becoming an exotic dancer, she studied psychology at North Carolina Central University. The transition came from her searching for “validation,” she said in the interview.  “I was looking for love and acceptance from people,” she said. “People to love me, to accept me, to pay attention to me for validation. But you can get all of that in Jesus. He loves us just the way we are. That’s what I learned in prison.  “I hurt my brothers and I hope they can forgive me and I want them to know that I love them and they didn’t deserve that and I hope they can forgive me. I hope they can heal.”  The danger of false rape allegations for actual victims  An advocate for victims of sexual assault said rare cases like this might discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and cause people to wrongly doubt them.  “False reports hurt not only the people falsely accused, they hurt every rape victim,” Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, vice president of communications for RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, told CNN. “There are already too many victims who do not report the crime for fear of not being believed. After a false report in such a high-profile case, even more survivors may be reluctant to come forward out of fear that law enforcement will not believe them.”  A study published by Violence Against Women in 2010 found that false sexual assault reports range from between 2 to 10 percent. A majority of sexual assaults, an estimated 63 percent, are never reported to the police, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor.",US,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,,,,0.113,0.794,0.093,-0.9676
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/kirstin-lobato-las-vegas-verdict/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"Las Vegas AP —  A federal jury in Nevada has awarded more than $34 million to a woman who was arrested at age 18, wrongly convicted twice, and served nearly 16 years in a Nevada state prison for a 2001 killing she did not commit.  Kirstin Lobato, who is now 41 and uses the name Blaise, cried and hugged her attorneys after a judge read the trial verdict Thursday in US District Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  “It’s been an uphill battle with many, many obstacles,” she told reporters. “And I’m happy that it’s all finally finished.”  Lobato said she didn’t know if becoming a millionaire would make up for years in prison, adding that she had “no idea what the rest of my life is going to look like.”  The civil trial jury found Las Vegas police and two detectives, now retired, fabricated evidence during their investigation and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Lobato. The panel determined that Lobato should receive $34 million in compensatory damages from the department and $10,000 in punitive damages from each former detective.  The detectives, Thomas Thowsen and James LaRochelle, and their attorney, Craig Anderson, declined to comment outside court. Anderson told US District Judge Richard Boulware he planned to file additional court documents following the verdict. Anderson said Friday an appeal was “likely.”  The department previously agreed to pay damages if the jury ruled in Lobato’s favor.  Lobato was 18 when she was interviewed by police without an attorney, arrested and charged with killing Duran Bailey in Las Vegas in July 2001. Bailey, who had been homeless, was found dead near a trash bin with a slashed neck, cracked skull and missing genitals.  No physical evidence or witnesses connected Lobato to the killing, and she maintained she never met Bailey. But police maintained she confessed in jail that she had killed a man who tried to rape her during a three-day methamphetamine binge.  Lobato was 19 when she was convicted of murder in 2002. The Nevada Supreme Court threw out that verdict and Lobato’s prison sentence in 2004 because her lawyers weren’t able to cross-examine a prosecution witness who testified that Lobato made the jailhouse confession.  Lobato was tried again in 2006, convicted of manslaughter, mutilation and weapon charges, and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.  She was exonerated and freed from prison in late 2017 after the Innocence Project and attorneys in Las Vegas again took her case to the state Supreme Court. Justices said evidence showed that Lobato was in her hometown of Panaca, Nevada, some 150 miles from Las Vegas when Bailey was killed.  Last October, a state court judge in Las Vegas issued a certificate declaring Lobato innocent of Bailey’s killing.  That action was challenged by Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson in a letter asking state Attorney General Aaron Ford to investigate how and why attorneys for Lobato acquired the certificate of innocence.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/baby-garnet-cold-case-michigan/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"CNN —  It was the middle of Jenna Gerwatowski’s workday at the local flower shop in Newberry, Michigan, when she got a call from an unknown number.  The now 23-year-old doesn’t usually answer unknown calls, but says she decided to pick this one up in May 2022.  To her surprise, it was a detective from the Michigan state police.  “He was like, ‘Have you heard of the Baby Garnet case?’” Jenna told CNN.  Jenna had heard of it. In 1997, a deceased infant was found in a campground pit toilet at the Garnet Lake Campground – right where Jenna grew up. Investigators couldn’t find any leads on the identity of the baby or anyone who witnessed a person abandoning an infant, according to a news release from the Michigan attorney general’s office. The case went cold, and the “Baby Garnet” case became a known murder mystery in Jenna’s small town for decades.  “Your DNA was a match,” Jenna says the detective on the phone told her. She was related to the dead infant from 1997.  Jenna was in shock. The detective sounded sure, Jenna said, but she wondered how he had even obtained her DNA.  About six months earlier, her friend had gotten a FamilyTreeDNA test for Christmas and Jenna decided to order her own. DNA from other Baby Garnet relatives led detectives to Jenna’s FamilyTreeDNA kit, according to court documents.  Jenna Gerwatowski, left, says the case was always a big mystery in her town. She had no idea the grandmother she'd never met, Nancy Gerwatowski, right, could be behind it. Jenna Rose Gerwatowski/Mackinac County Sheriff's Office  The detective said a woman from Identifinders International, a genetic genealogy investigation firm, would call her about her DNA to help with identifying closer relatives, according to Jenna.  According to court documents, detectives reopened the cold case in 2017 and then worked with a forensics company to extract DNA from Baby Garnet’s partial femur, before sending the results to Identifinders International.  Jenna explained the situation to her mother when she got home from work.  “It was just crazy,” Jenna said. “We were both sitting there like, I don’t even know who (the mother or father) could’ve been. We were both so confused and we’re like, it’s got to be somebody that we don’t know, you know, like a distant cousin or something.”  Jenna said her mother, Kara Gerwatowski, started to wonder whether the detective call was a scam.  Jenna’s grandfather had just been scammed by someone claiming to be a detective, so Kara told Jenna to be cautious about giving out personal information or passwords.  Misty Gillis, then a senior forensic genealogist and cold case liaison from Identifinders International, called Jenna that night, according to Jenna and court documents filed later in the case.  Jenna claims Gillis requested her FamilyTreeDNA password to be able to upload her DNA into a separate database. Jenna was concerned it was a scammer and refused to cooperate, according to court documents.  “I hung up the phone on her, not even thinking twice about it. And we went about our day. I was like, how weird. What a weird thing to scam people about,” Jenna said. “I wholeheartedly did not think that it was real.”  One week later, Jenna was working at the flower shop when she got a distressed call from her mother.  “She was like, ‘I really need you to come home. … It’s an emergency. Like, just please come as soon as you can,’” Jenna said.  Jenna rushed home thinking someone died. Her cousin was sitting with her mom at their round wooden kitchen table. Police had contacted her cousin, who works as a victim’s advocate in the county prosecutor’s office, to explain the Baby Garnet situation to Jenna. It turned out it wasn’t a scam.  “My mom had tears in her eyes,” she said. Jenna’s cousin had “just pure shock on her face. … You could hear a pin drop in there.”  Even though Jenna knew she had nothing to do with the Baby Garnet case, she was terrified police would think she was trying to hide something because of her refusal to speak with Gillis. She immediately called her.  An analysis of Jenna’s DNA kit showed she was the half-niece to Baby Garnet, according to court records.  On June 1, 2022, detectives spoke with her mother, Kara, who agreed to provide her DNA. Kara was the half-sister of Baby Garnet, according to court records.  “I feel like that is when, like, all of the puzzle pieces kind of started falling together for her,” Jenna said. “And she told detectives that, if it’s going to be anybody, it would be (her) mother.”  Kara, now 42, had not spoken with her mother, Nancy Gerwatowski, since she was 18 because they had a bad relationship, and Jenna had never met her grandmother. Regardless, both were shocked Nancy, who was living in Wyoming when police questioned her, would be the one behind their town mystery.  “I had grown up knowing about the case my whole life and then come to find out it was my grandma that did it?” Jenna said.  The Michigan attorney general’s office alleges Nancy “delivered the newborn alone at her Newberry home, during which Baby Garnet died due to asphyxiation, and that this death could have been prevented by medical intervention (Nancy) Gerwatowski did not seek.”  However, in a court filing, Nancy’s defense argues she unexpectedly gave birth while in the bathtub and the fetus “became trapped inside her birth canal.” She “attempted to pull the fetus out of her own body,” the filing says, but couldn’t deliver the fetus and lost consciousness “at some point in the delivery.” When she was finally able to deliver the fetus, it was dead, the filing says.  Her defense argues that Nancy, like the average person in the county in 1997, did not have access to a telephone or cell line, so she couldn’t call 911. While she concedes in her legal filings she placed the stillborn fetus in a bag and left the remains at the campground, her defense attorneys argue she had been in shock after having had no pain medication during the traumatic birth.  Nancy is charged with one count each of open murder, involuntary manslaughter, and concealing the death of an individual. Open murder carries a potential life sentence.  In a hearing on Thursday, Nancy’s defense argued that the case against her should be dropped in its entirety because the state cannot prove the baby was born alive. If the court allows the case to proceed, the defense argued, Nancy’s statements during police interrogation should be excluded because she was denied her right to counsel — a contention the state disputed. If the court does allow her statements to be a part of the trial, Nancy’s lawyers want her comments about considering an abortion and not seeking out prenatal care to be excluded, while the state argued the comments are relevant to possible motive.  Judge Brian D. Rahilly said he hopes to reach a decision on whether or not to drop the charges by next week or around the end of the year at the latest.  “It was a very hard time … very traumatizing and very nerve-wracking,” said Jenna. “I’ve never met this woman, so it was hard for me to even grasp that concept, but even harder for my mom because that was her mother.”",US,Baby Garnet cold case update: A DNA test helped solve a 1997 Michigan murder,,,,0.144,0.794,0.061,-0.9991
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-thursday-hnk/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"CNN —  Marked shell casings from the assassination scene match the gun found on the suspect. His fingerprints match some key items investigators found nearby. And he was arrested this week – after going silent from his mom and friends for months – with a fake ID and a handwritten “claim of responsibility” referencing the crime site.  These details and others, shared by law enforcement and people who know suspect Luigi Mangione, have been mounting since last week’s daylight killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a busy sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of the investigation into Thompson’s killing, sources tell CNN.  A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN at least two of the warrants include the backpack found in Central Park and the burner phone found along the getaway route police believe Mangione took from the shooting scene. Investigators also searched the hostel where suspected killer Mangione stayed the night before the shooting and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  After a five-day, multi-state manhunt that leaned heavily on surveillance images and pleas for the public’s help, Mangione, 26, is now charged in the case with murder after a tip led to his arrest Monday at a McDonald’s nearly 200 miles from where the brazen homicide unfolded.  Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury in the case against Mangione, sources told ABC News.  Mangione was charged in a felony arrest warrant earlier this week. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  Blair County Judge David Consiglio scheduled a hearing in Pennsylvania on December 30 in response to Mangione’s petitions for writ of habeas corpus and imposition of bail, court documents from Thursday show.  Mangione was denied bail on Tuesday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania. The habeas corpus petition is a key factor in whether the suspect can be extradited to New York.  Mangione’s team was given two weeks from Tuesday to file the habeas corpus petition, which challenges Pennsylvania’s ability to prove that Mangione is the person the state of New York has issued the arrest warrant for, according to Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.  Mangione is also set to appear in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, court on December 23 for a preliminary hearing related to state charges.  Mangione’s lawyer has denied his client’s involvement in the December 4 killing and anticipates he will plead not guilty to the murder and other charges in New York, as well as to charges related to the 3D-printed gun and fake ID in Pennsylvania, where he was caught and is being held without bond.  Defense attorney Thomas Dickey on Wednesday also dismissed the ballistics and fingerprint evidence revealed publicly hours earlier, saying he wants to examine it himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”  Thomas Dickey, attorney for suspected shooter Luigi Mangione, speaks Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “As lawyers, we need to see it. We need to see: How did they collect it? How much of it? And then we would have our experts … take a look at that, and then we would challenge its admissibility and challenge the accuracy of those results.”  Still, New York’s governor expects a murder indictment “to be issued any day now, and the second that happens, I’m issuing a warrant for extradition.”  “It feels like the evidence is very compelling,” Gov. Kathy Hochul told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. “I trust the DA here in Manhattan to make sure that he puts forth an indictment that is going to be iron-clad.”  Meanwhile, Hochul is unimpressed by the folk hero status Mangione has attained on social media as the killing of Thompson – a husband and father of two – has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry.  Mangione appears to have been driven by anger against the industry and “corporate greed” as a whole, states a New York Police Department intelligence report that also warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  “That horrific attack occurred on our streets,” Hochul said Thursday. “And the people of our city deserve to have that sense of calm that this perpetrator has been caught, and he will be never seeing the late of day again if there is justice.”  “You cannot assassinate an individual on the streets of New York – not now, not ever.”  Neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said on Thursday.  Suspect hadn’t spoken to mother since July  Until he was found Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Mangione had gone quiet from at least a few people who appear to have been close with him. The scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, he had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  Mangione’s mother had reported him missing November 18 – two weeks before Thompson’s killing – a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. She called police in San Francisco, where she knew her son had been living, and told authorities she’d called his phone repeatedly to find the voicemail full and not taking any more messages.  Mangione’s mom had no reason to believe her son was a danger to himself or others, she told the San Francisco Police Department, but she hadn’t actually spoken with him since July 1, the official said. He had worked remotely at TrueCar, she also said, where the phone was disconnected and the offices closed, the official added.  It also doesn’t appear Mangione had posted anything since midsummer to social media, where posts addressed to his X account suggest some of his friends have been trying to get in touch with him.  In July, a user tweeted at Mangione, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding. In late November, just weeks before the shooting, another user posted at Mangione, “thinking of you and prayers everyday in your name. Know you are missed and loved.”  As Mangione entered a Pennsylvania courthouse this week, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, he yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Suspected shooter Luigi Mangione is led from the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “He’s irritated, agitated about what’s happening to him and what he’s being accused of,” Dickey told CNN of Mangione’s outburst and struggle with police.  “He never had any legal representation until he walked into that building yesterday. And I talked to him … look at the difference between when he went in and when he came out … now he has a spokesperson and someone that’s going to fight for him.”  Suspect linked to fingerprints and gun  Police in New York on Wednesday publicly revealed the first positive forensic match and direct physical evidence tying Mangione to Thompson’s killing, law enforcement officials told CNN.  “We got the gun in question back from Pennsylvania. It’s now at the NYPD crime lab,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “We were able to match that gun to the three shell casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of the homicide.”  A 3D-printed gun was in Mangione’s possession when he was arrested Monday, police have said.  The three 9 mm shell casings had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, one word per bullet, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Police have been looking into whether those words, which match the title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry, may point to a motive in the killing.  Authorities also had been probing DNA material and a partial fingerprint from a discarded Starbucks water bottle and an energy bar wrapper surveillance images showed the suspect buying about 30 minutes before the shooting. Mangione’s fingerprints were confirmed as a match, Tisch said  Along with the prints and ballistics, investigators have been examining writings police have said Mangione had upon arrest, including a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility.” It did not include specific threats but indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday.  In some writings, he referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny added. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  Investigators also are looking at the suspect’s writing in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.  It included to-do lists to facilitate a killing, as well as notes justifying those plans, the source said. In one notebook passage, Mangione wrote about the late Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber who justified a deadly bombing campaign as an effort to protect against the onslaught of technology and exploitation. Mangione had written about the Unabomber in online posts as well.  In a notebook passage, Mangione concludes using a bomb against his intended victim “could kill innocents” and shooting would be more targeted, musing what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/louisville-police-reform-breonna-taylor/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"Louisville, Kentucky AP —  The US Justice Department and the city of Louisville have reached an agreement to reform the city’s police force after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, officials said Thursday.  The consent decree, which must be approved by a judge, follows a federal investigation that found Louisville police have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the “historic content decree” will build upon and accelerate, this transformational police reform we have already begun in Louisville.” He noted that “significant improvements” have already been implemented since Taylor’s death in March 2020. That includes a city law banning the use of “no-knock” warrants.  The Justice Department report released in March 2023 said the Louisville police department “discriminates against Black people in its enforcement activities,” uses excessive force and conducts searches based on invalid warrants. It also said the department violates the rights of people engaged in protests.  “This conduct harmed community members and undermined public trust in law enforcement that is essential for public safety,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This consent decree marks a new day for Louisville.”  Once the consent decree is agreed upon, a federal officer will monitor the progress made by the city.  The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened 12 civil rights investigations into law enforcement agencies, but this is the first that has reached a consent decree. The Justice Department and the city of Springfield, Massachusetts announced an agreement in 2022 but the investigation into that police department was opened under President Donald Trump’s first administration.  City officials in Memphis have taken a different approach, pushing against the need for a Justice Department consent decree to enact reforms in light of a federal investigation launched after Tyre Nichols’ killing that found Memphis officers routinely use unwarranted force and disproportionately target Black people. Memphis officials have not ruled eventually agreeing to a consent decree, but have said the city can make changes more effectively without committing to a binding pact.  It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department’s priorities around civil rights.",US,"DOJ, Louisville reach deal after probe prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor",,,,0.054,0.79,0.156,0.9902
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"CNN —  Weeks of mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey are prompting heightened security concerns – and mounting frustrations – from residents, military personnel and federal, state and local officials.  While the state’s governor says there’s no threat to public safety, other state officials and local mayors are alarmed.  “I’m legitimately concerned for what the hell is going on because nobody knows,” state Assemblyman Brian Bergen told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey after a briefing at state police headquarters on Wednesday.  “We are literally being invaded by drones. We have no idea who is doing it and where they’re coming from,” Pequannock Mayor Ryan Herb told the station after the briefing.  Law enforcement has not identified the origin or landing sites of the drones, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday. He added that the drones primarily operate at night, often displaying flashing lights, but they turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached.  According to Melham, the drones have eluded radar detection, possibly because they do not emit frequencies or possess evasion capabilities.  He also raised alarm over where some of the drones have been spotted.  “One of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey’s critical infrastructure,” Melham said.  The mayor of West Milford, Michele Dale, reported 60 drones hovering over local reservoirs.  Some members of Congress have speculated that a foreign entity may be involved in the drones, something the Pentagon rebuffed Wednesday.  The denial came hours after US Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, told Fox News the drones were from “a mothership” from Iran that is “off the East Coast of the United States of America.”  “There is not any truth to that,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.”  Meanwhile, US Northern Command, which oversees the Defense Department’s homeland security efforts, said in statement Wednesday that it had “conducted a deliberate analysis of the events” regarding the drone sightings but had not been asked “to assist with these events.”  A spokesperson for the US Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged an encounter by one of its assets with the drones.  “Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  The aircraft were not seen as an immediate threat and did not interfere with operations, Pinneo added.  CNN reached out to the Coast Guard but did not receive an immediate response.  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told WBGO on Wednesday the public should feel secure while acknowledging their fears.  “Based on everything we know, there is no public safety risks we’re aware of,” Murphy said.  “Is it frustrating to have no answers? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes,” the governor told the radio station.  The sightings began November 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. At times, large drones — some up to 6 feet in diameter — were seen nightly in New Jersey from dusk until 11 p.m., with sightings ranging from 4 to 180, according to state lawmakers who attended the briefing Wednesday.  The drones operate in a coordinated manner, turning off their lights to evade detection, complicating tracking efforts. They are not identified as hobbyist drones or linked to the Department of Homeland Security, State Assembly member Dawn Fantasia said on X.  The FBI is leading the investigation with the New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, while the US Coast Guard is assessing jurisdictional responses.  Federal agencies have ruled out any connections of local, state, or federal governments to the sightings.  Melham called for a temporary flight ban on all personnel and commercial drones in his video update, despite official advisories against such measures.  Concerns escalated after drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to military officials and state lawmakers. The sightings prompted the FAA to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.  Unnerved residents have described frequently seeing the drones hovering overhead, sometimes traveling in clusters.  While visiting family in New Jersey, travel content creator Katie Caf initially doubted reports of drones until she spotted several moving in a “zigzagging” pattern on Saturday. The 29-year-old noticed five potential drones, which she described as being the size of a bicycle. “They’re so weird looking and they’re much bigger than normal drones. I get why everyone is freaking out now … I think it’s kinda spooky.”  Fantasia said on X that the briefing occurred Wednesday at the New Jersey State Police headquarters and included descriptions of the aircraft’s movements and federal agencies’ response.  Though Murphy has said there is no known threat to the public, Fantasia and other local leaders have expressed doubt and are demanding more transparency into the investigation.  US Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, pushed for more information from federal investigators in a letter sent Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  “I recognize the need to maintain operational security of ongoing investigations and that this situation requires complex interagency coordination,” Booker wrote. “However, there is a growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state – from constituents and local officials alike – despite assurances that the drones pose no known threats to public safety.”  The FBI in Newark has asked the public to report any information related to the drones, including in several areas along the Raritan River.  “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI field office in Newark said December 3.  During a US Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday, Robert Wheeler, assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, called the phenomenon “concerning” but said “there is nothing that is known” that would lead him to identify a public safety risk.  CNN has sought more information from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and New Jersey State Police.  This story has been updated with additional information.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/university-of-mississippi-student-killing-mistrial/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"AP —  A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the case of Sheldon “Timothy” Herrington Jr. in the 2022 killing of Jimmie “Jay” Lee, a gay man who was prominent in the LGBTQ+ community at the University of Mississippi.  Jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict after over nine and a half hours of deliberation.  Lee’s body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead.  Herrington, 24, showed little emotion as he left the courtroom with his attorneys and several relatives. He remains free on bond and is still charged with capital murder, which Mississippi law defines as a killing committed along with another felony — in this case, kidnapping. Prosecutors had said they would not seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison if he is tried again and convicted.  Jurors on Wednesday were told they could also consider lesser charges of first-degree murder, punishable by life in prison; second-degree murder, 20 years to life; or manslaughter, up to 20 years.  University of Mississippi student Jimmie ""Jay"" Lee is seen in this undated image. Oxford Police Police Department  Circuit Judge Kelly Luther said he will consult with prosecutors and defense attorneys about setting another trial.  Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee, 20, was pursuing a master’s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.  Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, where the university is located and the trial was held.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee vanished. Investigators testified that they used warrants to obtain electronic records including explicit messages between social media accounts belonging to the two men and online searches conducted by Herrington, including one inquiring how long it takes to strangle someone.  Prosecutors said during closing arguments Wednesday that Herrington and Lee had a sexual encounter that ended badly and Lee left Herrington’s apartment. They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex. Prosecutors said Lee was killed after going back.  “Tim Herrington lived a lie — lived a lie to his family,” District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. “He lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.”  Herrington’s attorney, Kevin Horan, has said prosecutors cannot prove Lee is dead without having a body. He told jurors Wednesday that text messages showed Herrington did not lure Lee to his apartment.  Judge Kelly Luther presides over the case of Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr. at the Lafayette County Courthouse in Oxford, Mississippi, on Wednesday. Bruce Newman/Pool/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal/AP  “He’s the one that’s being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,” Horan said of Lee.  Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.  Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained explicit messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.  Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched “how long does it take to strangle someone” at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.  The final text message from Lee’s phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington’s apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee’s phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee’s car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.  On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.  Herrington’s relatives sat behind him in the courtroom, and Lee’s sat behind prosecutors. When Luther dismissed court after the mistrial, he instructed the two groups to leave separately.  Jurors were chosen from another county about 250 miles to the south. They heard eight days of arguments and testimony.  The judge twice urged jurors to continue deliberating when they said they were deadlocked. After the third such message, Luther declared the mistrial and thanked them for serving, adding: “I’ve asked a lot of you.”",US,Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee: Judge declares mistrial after jury deadlocks over killing of gay University of Mississippi student,,,,0.136,0.808,0.056,-0.9977
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/us/timeline-luigi-magione-ceo-shooting/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"CNN —  As investigators work to piece together the possible motive and movements of 26-year-old Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione, suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, here’s what we know.  This timeline is based on information from law enforcement sources, official police releases, surveillance images and social media records.  Summer of 2024  Mangione had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  During the summer, Mangione appears to stop posting online, prompting worried messages from some of his friends.  In July, one user posts on X, tagging Mangione, saying, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding.  Mid-November  Mangione’s mother reports her son missing in San Francisco, law enforcement officials said.  Sunday, November 24  10:11 p.m. – Mangione arrives in New York at the Port Authority bus terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue via a bus that originated in Atlanta, then gets into a cab that takes him to the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, where he stays about half an hour.  There was an interaction while the suspect was checking in at the hostel, making casual conversation. ""At some point, he pulled his mask down and smiled at the at the clerk,"" said Joseph Kenny, NYPD chief of detectives. NYPD  11 p.m. – He takes another cab to a hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave. on the Upper West Side, identified as HI New York City Hostel in charging documents.  11:20 p.m. - Surveillance footage from the hostel shows him checking in and showing a driver’s license, according to the arrest warrant in the case. Records from the hostel show he provided a New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario on it, the warrant says.  Friday, November 29  Mangione checks out of the hostel.  “It’s not your traditional check in, check out. It’s the kind of thing where if you don’t show up at a certain time, they automatically just check you out,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. “We don’t believe that he went someplace else. It’s more of an administrative checkout.”  Saturday, November 30  Mangione checks back into the hostel.  Wednesday, December 4  5:34 a.m. – Surveillance footage reviewed by law enforcement shows Mangione leaving the hostel, possibly by bike.  5:41 a.m. – He is seen wandering around the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown, on Sixth Avenue between West 53rd and 54th Streets, and goes back and forth for a bit before heading toward a Starbucks.  “We have him wandering around, walking in the vicinity of hotel, walking on 54th Street, walking back and forth,” Kenny said.  Around 6:17 a.m. – Images from Starbucks show him buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, according to a law enforcement official.  Image of the suspect at a Starbucks on Sixth Avenue. NYPD  6:19 a.m. – Surveillance video near a deli on West 55th Street appears to show him walking and briefly stopping by a pile of trash.  Gideon Platt, Stage Star Deli  6:30 a.m. – Around 6:30 a.m., surveillance video captures what appears to be the gunman on the phone.  Patrick Laborde  6:44 a.m. – Thompson, the victim, walks toward the Hilton after leaving his hotel across the street, police said.  The masked gunman is “lying in wait” outside the hotel as Thompson makes his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.  The gunman comes up behind Thompson and shoots him in the back, Kenny said. He then walks toward Thompson and continues to shoot, stopping to clear a gun jam before firing again.  Obtained by CNN  Investigators told CNN that after the shooting, the assailant crosses the street from the Hilton, flees northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street, and gets on an electric bike on 55th Street before heading north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.  Obtained by CNN  6:48 a.m. – Mangione is seen riding an electric bike into Central Park at 60th Street, according to Kenny.  NYPD  6:56 a.m. – He rides out of the park.  6:58 a.m. - He is seen on the bike at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue.  7:00 a.m. - He is no longer on the bike and is heading northbound on 86th Street.  7:04 a.m. - Mangione gets into a cab.  7:30 a.m. – He is seen near the George Washington Bridge and a Port Authority bus station off 178th Street.  Video shows the suspect entering the bus station.  “We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” Kenny said.  5-Day Manhunt  The suspect was in Pennsylvania for “several days” after the shooting in Manhattan, according to Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police.  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the suspect traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in Altoona, where he is arrested.  Monday, December 9  In a new post on social media, Pennsylvania State Police shared new images of Luigi Mangione sitting inside the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was captured on Monday. The images show Mangione eating what appears to be a hash brown inside the establishment. Pennsylvania State Police  9:14 a.m. - Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania are dispatched to a McDonald’s restaurant, after an employee tipped off police about someone resembling photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police.  9:58 a.m. - Mangione is taken into custody at the McDonald’s, where he presented police with a forged New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario as his identification – the same ID he presented at the hostel, according to the arrest warrant.  Mangione was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea in his first court appearance in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, later that day.  Mangione has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a firearm, according to charging documents released by New York prosecutors.",US,Timeline: Before and after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s killing,,,,0.063,0.905,0.031,-0.9823
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/us/wisconsin-kayaker-fake-death-in-custody/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"Green Lake, Wisconsin AP —  A Wisconsin man who faked his own drowning and left his wife and three children to go to Eastern Europe is in police custody, online records show.  Ryan Borgwardt, 45, was booked into the Green Lake County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system, a service that provides information to crime victims such as a person’s jail custody status. No charges were listed.  The Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday in a social media post that a news conference would be held Wednesday morning to update the Borgwardt case. The post said no further information would be provided until then.  A person answering the phone at the sheriff’s office Tuesday night declined to confirm whether Borgwardt was in custody. County jail officials didn’t immediately return a phone message Tuesday night.  Last month, Sheriff Mark Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on November 11 after disappearing for three months but that he hadn’t committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were “pulling at his heartstrings” to come home. He suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance.  Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of “personal matters,” the sheriff said. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it’s the deepest in Wisconsin.  After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane.  The sheriff said at the time that investigators were working to verify Borgwardt’s description of what happened.  The sheriff’s office has said the search for Borgwardt’s body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn’t expect the search to last more than two weeks.",US,"Ryan Borgwardt: Wisconsin kayaker who faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe is in custody, online records show",,,,0.06,0.933,0.007,-0.9398

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-administration-big-donors/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"CNN —  Nearly three dozen of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks to serve in his incoming administration donated to his campaign or to the deep-pocketed outside groups that worked to elect him, a CNN analysis of federal campaign records shows.  They range from tech multibillionaire Elon Musk – who has emerged as the single largest, disclosed political donor of the 2024 presidential election – to others close to Trump tapped for key roles throughout government.  In all, eight of his Cabinet picks – led by Linda McMahon, the billionaire wrestling magnate Trump has selected to oversee the Education Department – and their spouses donated more than $37 million combined from their personal accounts to aid Trump, the review found, underscoring the proliferation of ultra-rich Americans now poised to shape US policy in the incoming second Trump administration.  (Two other Cabinet choices, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, transferred money from their campaign accounts to the pro-Trump effort.)  Musk has not been selected for a formal Cabinet job but is helping guide a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative and has played a pivotal role in the presidential transition – offering his views on job candidates, talking to world leaders and meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as he weighs how to downsize the federal government.  In all, the SpaceX and Tesla chief executive donated more than $277 million to federal elections this cycle, the lion’s share of which – more than $262 million – benefited Trump. Most of Musk’s pro-Trump dollars flowed to a super PAC that the world’s richest man created to help turn out voters on the Republican’s behalf in key swing states.  Outside of self-funded presidential candidates, no individual has donated more to shape federal contests in a single election cycle, said Brendan Glavin, research director of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes money in politics.  Trump’s donors “are not just getting these sort of plum ambassadorships on the side,” Glavin said. “Major donors are getting positions that affect policy.”  The CNN analysis researched the more than 90 people that Trump had announced for high-level positions in the administration through Tuesday, which marked five weeks since his election victory. More than 30 of them had donated to his campaign or to one of the leading Trump-aligned outside groups, the review of FEC records found.  “Millions of Americans fed up with failure in the White House and federal government joined President Trump in the movement to restore our nation’s greatness. Some who will work with President Trump are among those millions of people who supported the campaign and helped the President win a decisive electoral victory,” Brian Hughes, a Trump transition team spokesman, said in a statement in response to CNN’s inquiry about donors joining the administration.  The total donations from Trump’s current Cabinet picks marks a surge from Trump’s first term. Five members of his original Cabinet had donated nearly $8 million to his committees or to the major outside groups supporting him, a review of campaign reports shows.  Donations from McMahon, who served as Trump’s SBA administrator in his first White House term, accounted for more than 90% of that total in the 2016 election.  The sums spent to aid Trump in 2024 far exceed the donations that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet members contributed to help him win the White House in 2020, FEC records show.  A dozen members of Biden’s Cabinet reported donations to his campaign or major super PACs involved in the 2020 election, giving less than $100,000 in total.  Billionaires in the administration  Musk’s spending dwarfed that of other supporters.  McMahon was the largest donor among Trump’s Cabinet picks and the second most generous contributor, after Musk, among the administration members announced through Tuesday, the review found.  Most of the $21.2 million she donated went to Make American Great Again, Inc., the main Trump-affiliated super PAC that spent heavily on advertising to aid his campaign.  Other seven-figure donors among Trump’s Cabinet picks include Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick, whom Trump has tapped to serve as Commerce secretary; Scott Bessent, the hedge fund executive Trump has selected to oversee the Treasury Department; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, his choice to head the Small Business Administration.  Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher, also was a major donor, contributing more than $2 million to the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and Trump’s joint fundraising committee.  Sprecher is the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and was at Trump’s side when the president-elect rang the opening bell at the exchange Thursday.  In an email, Loeffler’s communication director Caitlin O’Dea said, “Senator Loeffler is proud to be one of President Trump’s strongest supporters for the same reason a historic landslide of Americans voted to put him back in the White House: he will restore American prosperity, security, and opportunity.”  The billionaire embrace marks a turnaround of sorts for Trump, who saw corporate America recoil from him after the violent January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And he has seen new support from tech leaders who are pushing for fewer regulations from the federal government.  The staggering sums spent by Musk in this year’s election helped Trump close the financial advantage of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who swiftly raised $1 billion after becoming her party’s standard-bearer in late July.  Super PACs face no limit on the size of donations they can receive or spend, but technically are not allowed coordinate their advertising decisions with the candidates they support.  However, a ruling this year by the FEC granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing efforts freed up Musk to guide a ground game for Trump.  “The campaign finance system is a joke,” said Fred Wertheimer, who heads the Democracy 21 watchdog group and is a longtime advocate for limits on money in politics. “Musk is the example now of how campaign finance laws have failed.”  He said he worries about government departments led by billionaires who have no “interest in doing the job that the agency was assigned.”  Musk did not respond to inquiries from CNN.  But Tom Davis, a former congressman from Virginia who chaired the House Republicans’ campaign arm for several years, argues “there is nothing inherently wrong about people who made a lot of money wanting to give back through government.”  “The fact that they have contributed shows a degree of loyalty,” he added.  Friends and family  Presidents often reward donors and allies with plum positions – often dispatching them to glamorous, low-conflict posts in Europe or the Caribbean.  Some of Trump’s early picks for ambassadorships follow that pattern and include billionaires who donated to his reelection effort. Among them: Arkansas investor Warren Stephens, named as the US’ envoy to the UK, and Charles Kushner, Trump’s choice for ambassador to France – one of several extended family members or close friends who has been chosen for diplomatic gigs.  Kushner, who donated $2 million to pro-Trump efforts and received a presidential pardon at the end of Trump’s first term, is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. Another donor, Tom Barrack, who oversaw the fundraising for Trump’s first inauguration, is his choice as ambassador to Turkey.  And incoming special envoy to the Middle East, real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff, is a longtime Trump friend and a partner in the cryptocurrency businesses that Trump launched with his sons earlier this year.  He donated $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC.",US,Big donors secure big roles in the incoming Trump administration,,,,0.022,0.846,0.133,0.9994

Trump filed the lawsuit in Florida federal court earlier this year, arguing that Stephanopoulos and ABC News defamed him when the anchor said 10 times during a contentious on-air interview with South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace in March that a jury found Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll.  Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and that he defamed her when he denied her claim. Trump has denied all wrongdoing toward Carroll.  In 2023, a jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, though it did not find that Carroll proved he raped her. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million for batter and defamation. In January, Carroll was awarded an additional $83.3 million in damages for his defamatory statements disparaging her and denying her rape allegations.  The jury did not find that Carroll proved Trump had raped her. Instead, a judge concluded months later when dismissing Trump’s countersuit against Carroll that the claim Trump raped Carroll was “substantially true.” The judge wrote in August 2023 that Trump “raped” her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.  In the lawsuit filed against ABC News in March, Trump claimed that Stephanopoulos’ statements were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.”  The case was allowed to move forward in July, with the judge refusing to dismiss the lawsuit, writing that these definitions were different enough. He added that the case would turn on “whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury’s verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.”  This story is breaking and will be updated.",US,ABC News settles defamation suit with Trump for $15 million,,,,0.156,0.804,0.04,-0.9932
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/antony-blinken-jordan-syria/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"Aqaba, Jordan CNN —  The United States has had direct contact with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Syrian rebel group now in de-facto control of the country, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday.  The first public confirmation of direct interaction with the US-designated terrorist group, known as HTS, came at the conclusion of Blinken’s diplomatic sprint through the region spurred by the sudden collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  “Yes, we’ve been in contact with HTS and the other parties,” Blinken said at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan. Blinken did not give details on when the contact was made or at what level. There is no legal barrier to speaking with a designated terrorist group.  “We have pressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,” Blinken said, referencing the American journalist who was detained in Syria more than a decade ago. The US has redoubled its efforts to find him in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse.  The US also shared the principles expected of a new Syrian government, including that the rights of all Syrians should be respected, that the country must not become a base for terrorism, that humanitarian aid must be delivered, and that chemical weapons stockpiles should be secured and safely destroyed.  Those principles, circulated by the US in the days after Assad’s shocking ouster, were further agreed upon in a joint statement by the US and a coalition of other countries at an urgent ministerial meeting in Aqaba on Saturday. Blinken said the agreement “sends a unified message to the new interim authority and parties in Syria.”  Ahead of the Saturday ministerial meeting, Blinken met with key partners in Jordan, Turkey and Iraq to garner consensus around the principles.  “America and our partners have an important stake in helping the Syrian people chart this new path,” the top US diplomat said Saturday. “We know what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders — from mass displacement to terrorism.”  “We can’t underestimate the challenges of this moment and the weeks and months ahead,” he added.  Throughout his trip, Blinken sought to emphasize those stakes. Moving forward, the dynamics on the ground in the region could present significant complications, despite a consensus on the principles.  There was an intense spate of fighting in recent weeks in northern Syria between Turkish-backed forces and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which the US sees as a key partner in the fight to keep ISIS degraded.  A fragile truce between the two sides in Manbij appears to be holding, but the fighting forced the SDF to halt its anti-ISIS operations, according to its top commander.  “This is a moment of vulnerability in which ISIS will seek to regroup, taking the advantage of transition in Syria,” Blinken said Saturday, reemphasizing the importance of the SDF.  In meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Ankara, Blinken warned the US does not want to see any party take actions that would allow ISIS to regroup, including by distracting the SDF from its mission to keep the terrorist group degraded and its fighters imprisoned, a US official said. Blinken also emphasized that nobody should take actions that could jeopardize factions in Syria from potentially coming together in a unified government.  In Baghdad, Blinken asked Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to crack down on the powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and to prevent Iran from transiting weapons through Iraq to Shia militias in Syria, the US official said. Such militias have targeted US personnel and interests in the past.  The response to Israel’s actions in Syria has also emerged as point of division between the US and its Arab partners.  Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has pummeled Syria with strikes and sent Israeli troops to — and beyond — a “buffer zone” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria, in what the United Nations said would be a violation of a 1974 agreement. Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Qatar have condemned Israel’s seizure of the buffer zone, calling it an attempted land grab.  The US, however, has not condemned the move, with Blinken saying that they are talking with the Israeli government.  “The stated purpose of those actions from the Israelis is to try to make sure that equipment that’s been abandoned — military equipment that’s been abandoned by the Syrian army — doesn’t fall into the wrong hands: terrorists, extremists, etc.,” he said Thursday. “But … we’re already talking with Israel; we’re all talking to others about the way ahead.”  A US official said Friday that Blinken intends to make clear to his Arab counterparts that Israel told the US that the incursion is temporary — and that the US expects it to be. That policy could change, however, next month when the Trump administration takes office, this official conceded.

Nancy Pelosi underwent a “successful” hip replacement surgery Saturday and is “well on the mend,” according to a spokesperson, one day after being hospitalized from an injury sustained during an official engagement in Luxembourg.  Pelosi was admitted to a hospital in Luxembourg as the result of a fall on the stairs, three sources told CNN. Pelosi’s office declined to comm﻿ent on how the California congresswoman was injured.  Pelosi, 84, is receiving “excellent care” from doctors and medical professionals, Ian Krager, the spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday.  The US military had medevaced the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. The medical center is a major military hospital that for years has treated US troops injured in combat.  “While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,” Krager said Friday.  Pelosi is “currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals. She continues to work and regrets that she is unable to attend the remainder of the CODEL engagements to honor the courage of our servicemembers during one of the greatest acts of American heroism in our nation’s history,” Krager said, adding that Pelosi “looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.”  The injury sustained by Pelosi came just days after longtime Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell tripped and fell at the US Capitol, spraining his wrist and cutting his face.  McConnell sustained a “minor cut to the face” and was “cleared to resume his schedule,” a spokesperson for the 82-year-old Kentucky Republican said in a statement Tuesday.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-ban-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"CNN —  TikTok has plans for another appeal as it faces a ban on January 19.  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected a temporary pause on the ban of TikTok, calling such a block “unwarranted” and paving the way for the Supreme Court to potentially decide the fate of the popular video-sharing app.  In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that required TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, to be sold to a non-Chinese company. The latest ruling follows last week’s decision by the same appeals court to uphold the law, citing national security concerns.  The Biden administration previously urged the appeals court not to issue a temporary block on the law, arguing that doing so might allow the company to wait months to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, effectively halting the law indefinitely.  “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said on December 6.  What will TikTok’s next appeal look like?  The Supreme Court could make a quick decision on the case. Both TikTok and the federal government previously asked the appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the January 19 ban.  But the Supreme Court, which has a six-justice conservative majority, seems likely to rule in favor of upholding the ban, Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN earlier this month.  “I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” Schiller said.  Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN earlier this month that the Supreme Court may decide not to review the case at all, in which case TikTok is out of luck.  Do you need to delete the app?  Not necessarily.  The Department of Justice said Wednesday that, if the ban takes effect, it would “not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok” for the app’s more than 170 million monthly users. But don’t expect any more updates from the app or the ability to download it, if the ban takes place.  Two leaders of the US House of Representatives’ committee on China sent a bipartisan letter to the CEOs of Apple and Google parent company Alphabet that said they should prepare to remove TikTok from their US app stores on January 19.  TikTok will also be unavailable on internet hosting platforms. The Justice Department warned users can expect the app to “eventually” be unworkable.  Can the ban be avoided?  There’s still some hope that TikTok could remain active in the United States, though ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell it.  The ban’s legislation leaves room for Biden to grant a one-time, 90-day extension if he determines a company has made progress toward a sale. He hasn’t suggested any plans to do so.  President-elect Donald Trump, who begins his term a day after the ban, could be on TikTok’s side. He said in July (in a video posted to the app) that he would “never ban TikTok” — although he did try to ban it during his first term.  There are a few options: Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, though experts say that’s unlikely to be successful. He could also direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month.",US,TikTok’s ban won’t be delayed.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-shop-ban/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"CNN —  Aakaanksh Autade was iffy on TikTok Shop, TikTok’s in-app shopping feature, when it launched last year. Then the content creator grossed over $100,000 in sales when he hosted a live event on Black Friday and went from skeptic to believer.  Autade is known for sharing tech-related tips and tricks on his TikTok channel, “kaansanity.” He took to TikTok Live for the first time on Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend to promote gadgets like headphones and game consoles. “It was my first time going live, and to make $102,000 in 10 hours was just insane. I didn’t expect it at all,” he said.  Aakaanksh Autade (left) promoted gadgets like the Nintendo Switch via TikTok Live on Cyber Monday. Courtesy Aakaanksh Autade/kaansanity  TikTok Shop allows users to buy and sell products without leaving the app. The sales platform combines entertainment and retail, making it particularly popular among Gen Z buyers, and it continues to grow. It has over 500,000 sellers in the US, including brands like L’Oréal, PacSun and Scrub Daddy.  TikTok Shop raked in $100 million in single-day sales this Black Friday — that’s triple the number from 2023, according to the company. Over Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend alone, the shop saw a 165% increase in shoppers year-over-year, according to a statement by the company this month.  However, a US appeals court this month upheld a law that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 or face a US ban.  That ban could grind the sales platform’s progress to a halt — but creators who spoke to CNN say that they’re sticking with TikTok Shop anyway because they don’t think a ban will actually happen.  “I don’t think TikTok is going anywhere. I think they’re going to figure it out, and there’s so many people invested in TikTok,” Autade said. “It’s hard to ignore how much it means to its users.”  What makes TikTok Shop tick?  TikTok Shop provides a pipeline from discovery to purchase by letting users shop products featured in live videos, pinned on brand and influencer profiles, or tagged in content shown on their algorithm-driven For You page.  Even before the launch of its shopping feature, TikTok had already established a reputation as a place for users to find items to add to their wishlists. A study conducted in 2022 by marketing consulting firm Material Plus found that 61% of users purchased an item after seeing content about it on TikTok, helped by hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which has over 12 million posts.  Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and TikTok creator, said combining passive entertainment with a shopping function can tempt users to open their wallets.  “You’ve got all these people who are spending so much time just being (on TikTok) consuming and creating content,” she said. “When you mix in commerce with our favorite source of entertainment, then we’re going to spend all our money there.”  TikTok Shop’s reliance on user-generated content allows consumers to hear from voices they trust.  Lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk says TikTok Shop's main draw is its ability to let consumers see their favorite influencers use the products they promote in real time. Courtesy Carrie Berk  Social media strategist Keenya Kelly says that TikTok Shop is another avenue for content creators to make money on TikTok without having to leave the app. Courtesy Keenya Kelly  “If you see your favorite creator promoting a product on a live stream or a video, you’re more likely to buy it in that moment,” said Carrie Berk, a lifestyle content creator. The thinking among viewers, she said, is that “if a makeup influencer is promoting a product on TikTok Shop, if she says it’s good, then it must be good.”  TikTok users like Autade also say that the app’s focus on short-form videos gives it an edge over other social media platforms.  “When I click on a product and I can see hundreds or even thousands of people posting a video about that product authentically, that really helps,” he said. “On a different platform, I might just see some words, some reviews, some stars here and there,” but seeing the product in action is different.  Another component of TikTok Shop’s growth is its popularity with younger users. Some 62% of Gen Z consumers say that TikTok is their platform of choice when they need to look something up, beating out search engines like Google, according to a report by marketing technology company SOCi published this year.  “Gen Z as a whole has really chosen TikTok as their premier destination for content,” said Jen Jones, chief marketing officer of e-commerce platform Commercetools. “TikTok shop just seemed like a natural place for those dollars to be spent.”  What would a TikTok ban mean for other social media retail platforms?  Social media shopping is not a new phenomenon.  Ninety-two percent of retailers plan to invest more in social commerce this holiday season, according to a study by Commercetools published in October. The same study showed that Facebook Marketplace was the social commerce platform of choice for businesses, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok Shop and X.  In particular, Jones sees an opportunity for YouTube to fill in the space TikTok could leave behind if a ban comes into force.  She says that YouTube could potentially meet demand for the style of short-form videos popularized by TikTok through YouTube Shorts while capitalizing on its longer-form content.  In the past year alone, people watched over 30 billion hours of shopping-related content on YouTube, the company previously told CNN in an email. In 2023, it launched YouTube Shopping, allowing content creators to tag products from brands featured in their videos and earn commissions.  Experts say that if the TikTok ban happens, it will serve as a lesson for brands to not put all their eggs into one marketing basket.  The Shop tab of the TikTok app is seen on an iPhone on June 23 in Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images  “It’s just really important for companies to have a very diversified strategy when it comes to social shopping,” said Jones. “We know that social shopping is here to stay. You can’t get locked into just one platform.”  Kelly says the same advice applies to individual content creators who make money off their posts and videos, and recommends cultivating a following through more direct forms of outreach like email lists.  “We use social media to reach a group of people,” she said. “You need to pull those people off social media onto email so that you have control over your business.”  Still, Kelly says she sees no reason for content creators to be concerned over the court ruling that moves TikTok one step closer to a ban.  “I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, she said. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.”  Berk commands an audience of almost 4 million followers on TikTok and describes the social media platform as a big part of her livelihood, but she says she’s not worried by the prospect of a total ban next month.  “There has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical,” she said.  Autade still has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, but he told CNN that TikTok was his primary marketing avenue and the platform that has brought him the most success.  Even as the threat of a ban looms nearer, he says it’s still business as usual and plans to continue with a live event in January similar to the one he hosted on Black Friday.  “I’m still all-in on TikTok. I’m still living my day-to-day life, running my businesses, and everything’s pretty much the same until I hear otherwise,” Autade said.",US,TikTok Shop was going to be the next big thing.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked.",US,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,,,,0.021,0.948,0.031,0.2114
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/sony-stock-record/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,,"CNN —  The last time Sony was worth this much on the stock market, Bill Clinton was president and the PlayStation 2 was about to debut on American store shelves.  It’s been a rough past two and a half decades for Sony, the 78-year-old company that invented the Walkman and the PlayStation and had long been an icon of consumer electronics. It largely missed the boat on the mobile phone revolution, and while the PlayStation has been profitable, production costs for other electronics have risen while demand has softened.  But as opportunities arise in streaming, Sony is trying to transition from being a legacy consumer electronics company to an original content and entertainment company.  The strategy is working: In the past three years, Sony’s stock (SONY) has started to break out of a decades-long slump. Sony’s stock price in Japan recently closed at the first record high since March 2000, signifying confidence in the company’s ability to evolve its game offerings and steer itself toward entertainment, Damian Thong, a research equity analyst at Macquarie, told CNN.  “If you went back 30 years ago, it was an electronics company, so best known as a seller of hardware,” Thong said. “But today, the company is primarily generating profits off of entertainment, which is games, music and (TV and movies).”  Less hardware, more content  Sony Group, Japan’s third largest company by market value, has turned itself around by innovating its games business beyond consoles and making acquisitions to expand its IP, Joost van Dreunen, an adjunct assistant professor at NYU Stern who teaches the business of video games, told CNN.  Sony acquired Anime powerhouse Crunchyroll in 2021, and it acquired American video game company Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion.  In addition to Sony Interactive Entertainment, which makes the PlayStation, the behemoth Sony Group also includes Sony Pictures, which produces films like the Spider-Man series, and Sony Music, which includes Columbia Records.  Sony is trying to unlock synergy across its subsidiary companies to produce original entertainment content for consumers, van Dreunen said.  Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal in the first season of ""The Last of Us."" Liane Hentscher/HBO  That strategy of leveraging its intellectual property across its brands became apparent at the 75th Emmy Awards in January, when the TV series “The Last of Us” won eight primetime awards. It was the first time a TV show adapted from a videogame earned major consideration at a Hollywood awards ceremony.  It was a momentous occasion for Sony, which first published “The Last of Us” as a videogame in 2013 before it was adapted to become a TV series released in 2023 on HBO and Max. (HBO and Max share ownership with CNN.)  Without a streaming network of its own, licensing its intellectual property and original content is part of Sony’s strategy to compete with streaming giants like Netflix, Disney and Amazon.  Robert Lawson, the chief communications officer for Sony Group, said in a statement that since 2018 when the company acquired EMI publishing, making Sony Music the world’s largest publisher of music, Sony has invested approximately 1.5 trillion yen into content IP across various entertainment businesses.  “Sony Group has shifted its corporate strategies towards strengthening its creation and entertainment assets,” Lawson said, noting the company is focusing on “new collaborations between Sony sister companies,” including leaning heavily into the anime genre.  In the last fiscal year ending March, Sony’s entertainment business, which includes music, movies and games, accounted for 60% of total revenue. That’s double from a decade ago, when the entertainment business accounted for just 30% of total revenue.  A long road to dominance  Doubling down on entertainment represents a departure from Sony’s origins.  Before there was Sony, there was Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, founded in 1946 by Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka. The company released Japan’s first-ever magnetic tape record in 1950. In 1958, the company changed its name to Sony Corporation.  In the 1960s, Sony established its business in the United States. For the next three decades, the Japanese company emerged as a household name in consumer electronics, producing iconic devices from the Trinitron color TV in 1968 to the Walkman cassette player in 1979 to the world’s first CD player in 1982, in addition to numerous cameras and video recorders.  Sony has also been involved with music since the 1960s through a joint venture with CBS that became Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Yet it’s largely been known for its electronics.

Aflo/Shutterstock  The 1990s were a high point for Sony as it broke into the world of gaming consoles. With the release of the PlayStation in 1994, Sony disrupted the arcade and gaming industry.  Since the 1990s, Sony has been a dominant player in the videogame console business with iterations of the PlayStation. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, which has consistently outsold its main competitors like Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Nintendo’s Switch, according to data from Ampere Analysis, an analytics firm for the games business.  Van Dreunen said that Sony is also looking to evolve in gaming beyond its console business, looking for new audiences and methods of distribution.  “We’re currently going through a softer period in gaming, and so it really raises the stakes for companies like, what’s next?” he said. “How do you as the dominant console maker continue to innovate and continue to grow your business?”  An original PlayStation is pictured at a display of various memorabilia in the lobby of the Sony headquarters building in central Tokyo on November 27, 2024.

Brooks/AFP/Getty Images  A customer walks away after purchasing the new Sony Playstation PS5 in Seoul on November 12, 2020, after Sony launched the new console in select markets around the world. Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images  Thong said that Sony has been successful in becoming a profitable channel for third-party publishers to sell videogames.  Sony has tried to diversify its strategy toward gaming, including publishing a videogame called Helldivers 2 across PlayStation5 and also PC. Helldivers 2 was a hit for Sony and sold over 12 million copies within three months of its release, according to Anna Kerr, a research manager for games at Ampere Analytics.  “The games business is spreading out its IP,” NYU Stern’s van Dreunen said. “It’s looking for new ways to reach customers, to expand that customer reach.”  In November, Sony announced a 69% percent jump in net quarterly profit, driven in part by its game segment. The company has had consistently strong quarters this year, driven by profitability in its games.  The company is now in talks to acquire Kadokawa, a Japanese videogame powerhouse that produces the popular videogame “Elden Ring,” according to people familiar with the matter.  There have been some headwinds: Sony’s rollout of the “Concord” vieogame and Sony Pictures’ latest installment of the Spider-Man universe were largely flops among fans this year. However, they are trial and error runs, van Dreunen said, and manageable expenditures for a company that has denoted 1.8 trillion yen ($11 billion) for acquisitions and stock buybacks through March 2027.  In May, at Sony’s annual investor conference, Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida said that the company was embracing a “creative entertainment vision.”  Sony’s emergence as an entertainment company was not always certain, Thong said.  “Sony had some years of quite substantial pain, I would say,” Thong said. “And I think to their credit, they managed to weather and see through it.”  Bringing Sony IP to the big screen  Van Dreunen said in the past, there wasn’t as much demand for videogame adaptations for movie and TV. Yet “The Last of Us” showed that Sony had an opportunity to bring more Sony IP to the big screen.  Before “The Last of Us,” Sony also tried its hand at videogame adaptation with “Uncharted,” a 2022 movie featuring actor Tom Holland that was based on a video game franchise first published by Sony in 2007.

Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg/Getty Images  Additionally, Sony is planning to adapt videogame franchise “God of War,” which it first published in 2005, to the big screen next year, Kerr said.  Sony is still in the electronics business, Thong said, noting its image sensors business works with companies like Apple and it produces high-end cameras. However, it has shed its identity as a mass consumer electronics company.  In 2025, Sony intends to spin off its online banking and insurance units, further doubling down on its entertainment offerings.

It’s a patchwork built over decades.”  Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.  “Together with employers, governments and others who pay for care, we need to improve how we explain what insurance covers and how decisions are made,” Witty wrote. “Behind each decision lies a comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety.”  Witty also praised UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was killed in midtown Manhattan last week, writing that Thompson “fought for preventive health and quality health outcomes rather than simply adding ever more tests and procedures.”  In a statement on Friday, UnitedHealthcare said “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company’s treatment of insurance claims” and that it “approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission,” noting that “around one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons.”  Will changes be made?  Thompson’s fatal shooting pushed Americans’ dissatisfaction with their health insurance into the spotlight. Many have made their frustrations abundantly clear on social media.  Journalists have also chronicled insurers’ efforts to twist the system to their benefit. STAT, a news site that focuses on health care, has published a series of investigative stories on UnitedHealth, including articles on how the nation’s largest health insurer uses a computer algorithm to cut off rehabilitation care for Medicare enrollees, limiting clinical case managers’ discretion.  Whether the public outcry prompts UnitedHealthcare and other insurers to adjust their practices — particularly the much-maligned denials of treatment and claims — or pushes lawmakers to force the industry to make changes remains to be seen. It depends, in part, on whether patients continue making their voices heard, experts say.  Angry consumers have had success in overhauling the health insurance industry in the past. They railed against the restrictions of health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, in the 1990s, as captured in the 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” That helped spur insurers to offer more preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, which have fewer constraints but are more costly.  Any shifts in the nation’s complex health care system, however, will not come easily, nor quickly, experts say. There are many players involved, each of which has its own patient care concerns, financial interests and lobbying dollars to influence lawmakers.  UnitedHealthcare’s mission  While many patients and their advocates argue that insurers deny care to pad their profits, the industry maintains that it is protecting consumers from high prices and unnecessary care.  Soon after Thompson’s murder, Witty vowed in an internal message to employees to continue the insurer’s mission of helping “the system improve.”  “Our role is a critical role, and we make sure that care is safe, appropriate, and it’s delivered when people need it,” said Witty in a video message obtained by CNN. “And we guard against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex and ultimately unsustainable. So we’re going to continue to make that case.”  “What we know to be true is that the health system needs a company like UnitedHealth Group,” he continued.  Asked Thursday whether it will make any changes in response to consumers’ public complaints, UnitedHealthcare referred CNN to Witty’s video. Other major insurers either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment, but a leading industry association said that hospitals, providers and employers all have “a direct impact on the cost and accessibility of medical services.”  “In the fragmented and heavily regulated health care system, health plans, providers and drugmakers share a responsibility to make high-quality care as affordable as possible and easier to navigate for the people we collectively serve,” AHIP, the trade group, said in a statement. “Health plans are working to protect patients from the full impact of rising costs while connecting them to care that is safe, evidence-based and coordinated.”  But the recent events may prompt insurers to investigate their practices and make some changes, Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in an email to CNN. This is especially likely if they see risks to their businesses, such as if employers threaten to leave because coverage decisions are too onerous for their workers.  On the flip side, “the main reason to not change their practices is to maintain their profitability while also keeping costs reasonable in a broad sense for their clients and end users,” Utterback wrote.

Hear why. 01:43 - Source: CNN  The HMO backlash  Though former President Bill Clinton failed to reform health care in the early 1990s, his administration’s efforts spurred increased concerns over the cost of care. That cued the growth of the HMO model, which allowed policyholders to see only certain doctors and required referrals from primary care physicians to see specialists and get certain tests and procedures. But HMOs also typically featured low premiums, low or no co-pays and no deductibles.  Policyholders rebelled because they felt they couldn’t access the care they needed, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.  Their angst was captured in extensive media coverage and in the 1997 film “As Good As It Gets,” when a young boy’s mother (played by Helen Hunt) tells a doctor (played by Harold Ramis) that her insurer would not cover an allergy test for her son’s asthma.  “F**king HMO, bastard pieces of sh*t,” Hunt says, before apologizing.  “That’s ok. Actually, I think that’s their technical name,” Ramis replies.  Many states responded to the complaints by passing patients’ bills of rights that limited HMO cost-control practices in state-regulated plans. Employers, who were hearing from angry workers, began shifting to PPOs, which generally provide coverage for a wider range of doctors but have much higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. PPOs have now largely eclipsed the managed care model.  But as health care costs continue to skyrocket, PPOs are instituting practices that resemble those of HMOs, particularly requiring approval of care in advance, known as prior authorization, Levitt said.  “If you think health care costs are rough now, imagine them without constraints,” said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+, a health care consulting group, and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.  Health insurers, however, do at times backtrack when faced with intense blowback. Earlier this month, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield halted its plan to limit the amount of time it would cover anesthesia used in surgeries and procedures after criticism from doctors and politicians. The policy was designed to reduce overbilling and make care more affordable, the insurer had said.  Efforts in Congress  Congress has tried for years to improve access to care and curtail costs, which are far higher in the US than in its peers even though it ranks last on key health measures. Lawmakers have held hearings and introduced bills, but there haven’t been comprehensive reforms enacted since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 — aside from several significant Medicare drug cost provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.  An effort to improve the prior authorization process in Medicare Advantage plans failed to advance in the Senate in 2022 after the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost about $16 billion over a decade.  However, there is now more bipartisan appetite on Capitol Hill to enact reforms, said Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive and vocal critic of the health care industry. Lawmakers reintroduced the prior authorization bill, which now comes with a zero cost estimate, and released a framework to establish so-called site-neutral payments in Medicare, under which Medicare would pay the same rate for a service provided in a hospital outpatient department, an ambulatory surgical center or physician’s office.  Plus, lawmakers are looking at reforms to the pharmacy benefit manager industry, which serves as a middleman between health insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers.  Republicans, who will control Congress starting in January, will be looking for cost savings to offset extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Whitlock said. That could push them to pass measures that would save the government money, such as site-neutral payments.  Meanwhile, the murder of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO will remain in the news as the case against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, winds its way through the court system. That will keep public frustration with health insurers in the spotlight – and could help advance legislation on Capitol Hill, Potter said.  “It will be a years long fight, but it’s going to happen,” he said. “Some kind of reform is inevitable.”",US,UnitedHealth Group CEO: America’s health system is poorly designed,,,,0.082,0.791,0.127,0.9982

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/us/drone-sightings-new-jersey-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"New York CNN —  Federal agencies are facing intense pressure to give the public more details on unexplained drone sightings in the New York City metropolitan area and beyond that have been going on for weeks over residential neighborhoods as well as restricted sites and critical infrastructure.  On Saturday, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey posted on X about the “growing number of drone sightings” there, making her state the latest to report such sightings, joining New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.  Federal officials have sought to calm the concerns about the sightings, but without giving further details about what they might be. They say there’s no evidence of a public safety threat, and many of the reported sightings are cases of mistaken identity.  “The bottom line is this: They’re not providing enough information to the public, and the public is concerned,” US Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Friday. “Believe me, I’m hearing from my constituents about this all the time, and I think it’s time for them to immediately get out there and brief.”  A drone sighting prompted the temporary closure of runways at New York’s Stewart International Airport on Friday night, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the Orange County airport about 70 miles north of New York City.  There were no impacts to the airport’s flight operations during the closure, which lasted about an hour, according to the Port Authority, which was alerted to the sighting by the Federal Aviation Administration.  “This has gone too far,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement Saturday, adding that last month she “directed the New York State Intelligence Center to actively investigate drone sightings and coordinate with federal law enforcement to address this issue.”  Earlier Friday, New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis called the response to the sightings “outrageous,” saying there are “drones and unmanned aerial systems flying above us and our government is not telling us who’s operating them and for what purpose?”  Malliotakis joined Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella in demanding answers.  Fossella said the drones, often seen flying at night, have been spotted hovering over critical infrastructures including Port Liberty New York near the Goethals Bridge, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and Fort Wadsworth, one of the oldest military installations in the country.  Representatives of the federal agencies investigating the drones who have briefed local officials behind closed doors said the drones sometimes appear to fly in a coordinated pattern and can sometimes be in flight for up to six hours, according to Montvale, New Jersey, Mayor Mike Ghassali.  And though federal officials have said there is no evidence the drone sightings pose a public safety threat, Belleville, New Jersey, Mayor Michael Melham has said he has received guidance police should call the county bomb squad if they encounter a downed drone.  In addition, local fire departments should wear hazmat suits when they respond, Melham said, saying the information was shared by his Office of Emergency Management following recent state-level meetings.  “We just don’t know what these things are, so we are being cautious,” Melham said.  Skepticism over government response  One New Jersey lawmaker is accusing federal officials of lying about the presence and purpose of the mysterious drones.  “They’re lying. That’s the long and the short of it,” Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson said in an interview Saturday with CNN’s Victor Blackwell.  Like several other officials and lawmakers, Peterson said he’s personally seen drones hovering near his rural New Jersey home, where he said the absence of street lights and nearby flight paths allows for clear visibility.  Peterson referenced the government’s response to the Chinese spy balloon that traversed over parts of the United States in 2023 to illustrate his point that the government is either embarrassed or unwilling to disclose the truth about the mystery drones due to security concerns.  “Why would you lie? Either because the reason that this is happening is incredibly embarrassing to the administration or it’s an incredibly high security risk for the country and they don’t want to tell us,” he said.  President-elect Donald Trump, meanwhile, has called on the Biden administration to either release any information it has about the mysterious sightings or shoot the drones out of the sky.  “Mystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government’s knowledge. I don’t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!! DJT,” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Friday his agency knows of “no threat or of any nefarious activity” related to the sightings.  Mayorkas pledged to be transparent “if we learn of any cause for concern.”  Officials are currently prioritizing the use of sophisticated radio frequency technology that can geolocate the operator of a drone, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.  There are multiple technical capabilities authorities can use to try and “defeat” a drone, including jamming a signal, disconnecting it from the operator or remotely “hijack” a drone but every option can pose numerous risks, the source said.  “Blowing it out of the sky is the last resort,” the source said, noting the option is always on the table if an aircraft presents a threat.  Federal and state officials said using offensive techniques to bring down the drones poses an unnecessary risk to people on the ground and legal challenges, especially as they have not been deemed threatening, the source said.  New Jersey’s Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has formally requested additional resources from the Biden administration to better address the ongoing situation.  “While I am sincerely grateful for your administration’s leadership in addressing this concerning issue, it has become apparent that more resources are needed to fully understand what is behind this activity,” Murphy said in a letter dated Thursday.  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.  Murphy’s concerns come as Naval Weapons Station Earle, a US Navy base south of Middletown, New Jersey, acknowledged Friday it had spotted “several instances of unidentified drones entering the airspace” above the facility despite no direct threats being identified.  “The base remains prepared to respond to any potential risks, leveraging robust security measures and advanced detection capabilities,” station spokesperson Bill Addison said in an email to CNN, adding there are airspace restrictions above the station.  The energy company PSEG on Saturday said it has “contacted the appropriate authorities” about reports of drones flying over its Salem and Hope Creek nuclear power plants in New Jersey.  Democratic Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey posted videos to his X account showing what appeared to be a cluster of drones over the Round Valley Reservoir Thursday night.  “This has gone on for weeks,” Kim wrote. “It’s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren’t able to track these devices to determine origin and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and counter measures.”  Last night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here’s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn — Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024  Morris County, about 30 miles west of New York City, issued a statement calling for “the federal government to marshal all federal resources at its disposal, including the military, to end the unauthorized flight of drones over our county and other parts of New Jersey.”  “Morris County and our communities have deployed considerable resources daily since the first drones were spotted,” the statement continued.  The Somerset County Sheriff’s Office similarly said in a Facebook post they had “increased vigilance” at sensitive locations and “are analyzing data and information on a daily basis.”  New York State Police said Friday afternoon in a post on X they had received “numerous reports of drone sightings over the past 24 hours” and they were investigating the reports. “We have no evidence at this time that any of the reported sightings pose a public safety threat,” reads the post.  Connecticut State Police announced Friday they have deployed a drone detection system to assist in investigative efforts into unauthorized drone sightings reported over Fairfield County.  “It’s very unsettling to public safety and security, both here in Fairfield and elsewhere,” Republican state Sen. Tony Hwang said in a statement Friday.  “What we have is a lack of information at all levels of government. It’s really a breakdown of communication. Without that vital communication, you lose the public’s confidence, you get speculation and you get fear,” he said.  And in Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro said his administration is “aware of” the reported drone sightings and is taking them seriously. The Democratic governor said Friday evening he directed the Pennsylvania State Police to look further into the sightings, and police will be flying helicopters to try to “determine where these drones are originating from and what the purpose of these drones are.”  White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby, in a press briefing Thursday, said there was “no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus.”  Kirby added many of “the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully.”  Mayorkas echoed Kirby’s explanation Friday, telling CNN some reported drone sightings were cases of “mistaken identity.”  Addressing calls to shoot down unidentified drones, he said, “It’s not as though anyone can just take down a drone in the sky. That in and of itself would be dangerous.”  Mayorkas added he has been in communication with New Jersey’s governor daily.  Congress briefed on drone sightings  Officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI briefed top committees in the House and Senate as well as a delegation of New Jersey lawmakers on the reported drone sightings, a source familiar with the situation tells CNN. The source said while there have been eyewitness reports of what appear to be drones over New Jersey, agency officials stressed in meetings Thursday many videos on social media appear to be civilian airplanes or helicopters.  “I don’t believe with all of these sightings, none of them are drones,” Gottheimer said, adding, “You can’t have the Wild West of drones out there,” with unmanned aircraft threatening infrastructure.  The New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness said there was “an active federal investigation” into the drone sightings, but elected officials want to hear more.  “We should be doing smart intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” US Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who sits on the Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said Thursday. “They should be shot down, if necessary, because they’re flying over sensitive areas.”  Residents in New York’s Rockland County reported drone sightings starting as early as November.  County Executive Ed Day sent a letter to President Joe Biden Friday seeking answers and urging his administration, along with the FAA and FBI, to investigate and provide clarity on the matter.  “The fact that this issue has persisted for weeks without clear answers is completely unacceptable — not just to the people of Rockland County, but to communities across the nation,” Day said in the letter. “It’s time for the Federal government to step up, take responsibility, and provide the answers we all deserve.”  Malliotakis said the situation “is creating havoc, people are confused, they’re concerned, they have anxiety, they don’t know what’s going on.”  No foreign involvement suspected by feds  The US intelligence community and federal law enforcement do not suspect foreign involvement in the drone sightings across New Jersey, security officials told members of Congress Thursday at one private briefing.  Key lawmakers assigned to congressional national security committees were told investigators do not currently believe the sightings involved an overseas connection, the use of foreign drones, nor an operator on the ground connected to a foreign government, according to a source familiar with the briefing conducted by representatives from the FBI, FAA and the Department of Homeland Security.  Officials said sighted drones have been observed with FAA-required anticollision lights and are not believed to have entered any restricted airspaces, according to the source.  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, New Jersey, on Dec. 5. Brian Glenn/TMX/AP  While authorities have not yet identified the origin of the mysterious drone flights, the source said an active FBI investigation remains underway to identify the person or persons operating them, and to determine whether any criminal violations of law have occurred.  Some of the more recent drone operations may be from copycats trying to play on people’s worries as the sightings get more news coverage, former FBI supervisory special agent Tom Adams told CNN. He said there are often innocent explanations, as well.  “I can tell you from my firsthand experience conducting operations for the FBI, as well as investigations into the suspected sighting of drones at critical infrastructure, it was fairly common for planets, crewed aircraft and even low Earth orbit satellites to be misidentified as drones at night,” Adams said.  Drones – unmanned aerial vehicles – are widely owned across the US. A total of 791,597 drones are registered with the FAA, split almost evenly between commercial drones and recreational drones.  Although the drones often display flashing lights, they frequently turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday.  The FAA issued temporary flight restrictions over the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster after drones were spotted in those areas, one week after the FAA received its first report of an unauthorized drone operation in the New York metro area on November 18.  “Until you know the origin and what these drones’ intent is, how can you tell me there’s no imminent threat?” Mayor Tony Perry of Middletown, New Jersey, told CNN Thursday.  Feds rarely coordinate drone info with locals  The sense that local officials are being left in the dark is partially a result of outdated laws keeping regulation of the skies entirely in federal hands, according to the chief executive of a company tracking unauthorized drone flights.  “The laws that regulate aircraft are not built to empower police to deal with the drones,” Axon CEO Rick Smith told CNN News Central Friday, “so if your local state fair has a drone coming towards it that police believe might be dangerous, right now there’s nothing they can do about it.”  Hochul, the Democratic New York governor, called on Congress to pass the Counter-UAS Authority Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act, which she said would give state and local authorities more power in dealing with unmanned aircraft systems and strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones.  The governor said that until these “powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden Administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  FAA regulations allow operators of recreational drones to fly up to 400 feet above the ground in airspace not controlled by FAA air traffic controllers. The FAA does grant waivers on a case-by-case basis to those wanting to operate drones in more congested airspace or at higher altitudes.  Giving local law enforcement more authority over drones is under consideration, Smith said, because traditional aircraft tracking technology is ineffective for vehicles hovering only a few hundred feet off the ground.  “The same radar and tracking system you use for a 747 just doesn’t work,” said Smith.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process with the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items which may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  FBI: San Francisco police recognized suspect  On Friday, the FBI told CNN they received a tip from the San Francisco Police Department, saying an officer with the department’s Special Victims Unit had recognized Mangione as a possible suspect on December 5 after seeing the surveillance photos of the suspect’s unmasked face.  The San Francisco Chronicle first reported on the tip Thursday.  Chronicle reporter Megan Cassidy told CNN’s John Berman her team reported “a few days ago” on the existence of a missing persons report in San Francisco for Mangione.  “Apparently, there was somebody at SFPD that was looking into the missing persons case, and after the shooting of Brian Thompson, recognized this person and called in this tip, or emailed this tip, to the FBI,” Cassidy said.  The FBI then sent the tip to New York investigators during the manhunt, the agency told CNN.  CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explained on Friday’s “AC360” how the tip ultimately made its way to the FBI in New York and the NYPD.  “This tip comes from, I think, a victim witness specialist in the San Francisco Police Department who had that missing persons case somewhere in front of them and looked at that face and says, ‘Gee, that could be the guy that is on these FBI posters all over town,’ so SFPD sends that to San Francisco FBI,” Miller said.  “San Francisco FBI says, ‘that’s a New York office case,’” he added.  Miller explained the FBI’s New York office likely sent the information to a violent crimes squad composed of a mix of FBI agents and NYPD officers.  “They look at it and they do a workup on the name, checking, you know, any indicators that guy’s been in New York, and then they send it over to NYPD,” Miller said.  By Sunday, the tip joined 200 viable leads being examined by authorities, according to Miller.  “Then Monday morning, at 9:15 in the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, another tip leads to the capture,” he said. “So you see, these leads are piling up, being tasked out and being worked, and this was in that pile coming up because it was a viable lead. It’s just that destiny took a hand quicker.”  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.

CNN —  I’m not much of a hugger. Sure, I’ll bust out the warm fuzzies for relatives around the holidays but I’m not like, say, my best friend, who prefers her hugs to produce the bone-liquifying pressure of an industrial vise. My husband loves to tell the story of our first date, when he approached me with open arms and I maneuvered him into a firm, businesslike handshake. Touch is just not my love language! And if you’re also not a hugger, the holidays are a gauntlet of outstretched arms and sweatered bosoms and unfamiliar colognes. We’ll make it through together! I recently watched some interviews with the lead actresses of the new “Wicked” film (which is sooo so good), and each tends to clutch the other’s single beautifully taloned finger when things get deep. I do that too! It is emotionally supportive without being suffocating (literally or figuratively). Fingertip-to-fingertip touching is the new hugging, pass it on.  Here’s all the good things that happened this week.  Nana Kyei  1. The Friendship Queen Diaries  It’s like something out of a movie: Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in 1996. Now, she’s a queen in Ghana. Despite her challenging youth, Johnson made sure she and her daughter were well-traveled, and after discovering she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, she founded a travel company to organize trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Her work attracted the attention of the Dakpema, a governing body in northern Ghana. She was blown away when they asked her to accept the title of “Zosimli Naa,” or “Friendship Queen.” The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the centuries-old Dagbon Kingdom, which comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in the city of Tamale, where she now lives. “We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.  CNN  2. Fabric of rebirth  The iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is finally open to the public again after a devastating fire damaged it five years ago. As part of this rebirth, fashion designer and artist Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was asked to create new vestments, or special service garments, for the cathedral’s clergy. Vestments are an important part of a church’s identity and de Castelbajac said the theme for the new look was “noble simplicity.” The designer drew inspiration from Notre Dame’s stained glass and blonde stone, creating a look that he said speaks to tradition and innovation; old and new. The vision was “radiant with color, radiant of hope, radiant of faith,” de Castelbajac told CNN. You can see details of the vestments in the photo above, and learn more about de Castelbajac’s process in this video.  CNN  3. Music on the brain  If you’ve ever shared your life with someone with dementia or another progressive neurological disease, you know music can be magic. Toronto-based company LUCID is combining facial mapping software, artificial intelligence, and music to create a therapy for older patients dealing with health challenges like Alzheimer’s, dementia and even depression and anxiety. The treatment involves measuring how a person’s brain reacts to music and combining that with facial mapping and artificial intelligence. Using this data, the technology can create specific playlists that hopefully can alleviate stress, restlessness, confusion and emotional discomfort in dementia patients.  Natalia Botero-Acosta  4. I would swim 500 miles  This whale puts The Proclaimers to shame! A male humpback whale has completed an extraordinary record-breaking migration, swimming more than 8,000 miles from South America to Africa. The humpback was first spotted off the coast of Colombia in 2013 and seen again a few years later not far from its original location. But in 2022, the whale was unexpectedly detected in the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa. The typical migration route for humpback whales can approach 5,000 miles in a single direction, making this one’s journey close to two times that of most whales. The discovery also marks the first documentation of an adult male humpback traveling between the Pacific and Indian oceans.

She co-founded the award-winning restaurant Takya, located in the 600-year-old historic center of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. Though the food has all the artfully prepared aura of a high-class restaurant, the menu is inspired by the traditional home cooking Al Motawa grew up with, and by her travels around Saudi Arabia and abroad. After seeing the deep connection between food and culture, Al Motawa wanted to “bring that same connection back home, to create a space where people could rediscover the beauty of Saudi cuisine.” Saudi Arabia itself is a country of great geographical, and thus culinary, diversity. For example, the Eastern Province is known for its seafood, such as Muhammar, a fried fish dish made with rice and sugar that was traditionally popular among sailors. In the country’s northern region, where temperatures are cooler and may drop below freezing during winter, traditional recipes focus on grains and meat, like the popular jareesh, a lamb stew made with wheat and yogurt.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said. Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and about 300 miles northwest of Sacramento.",US,Downtown San Francisco experiences first tornado warning in recorded history,,,,0.138,0.835,0.026,-0.989
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/crystal-mangum-duke-lacrosse-allegations/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  More than 18 years after accusing three former Duke University lacrosse players of raping her, a falsified account she shared in graphic detail, Crystal Mangum has admitted she lied about the encounter.  In an interview on a web show published Wednesday, Mangum apologized to the men and said her relationship with God has made her understand why she fabricated the story. Mangum is serving time in prison on a second-degree murder conviction for killing her boyfriend.  The timeline of the North Carolina case begins in 2006, when Mangum said she was trapped inside a bathroom, sexually assaulted and raped by David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann at a team party where she was performing as an exotic dancer. The men were arrested following her allegations.  “I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn’t, and that was wrong. And I betrayed the trust of a lot of other people who believed in me,” Mangum said on Katerena DePasquale’s show, “Let’s Talk with Kat.” “I made up a story that wasn’t true because I wanted validation from people and not from God.”  David Evans, left, Collin Finnerty, center, and Reade Seligmann, right, look on during a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2007. Chuck Burton/AP/File  For more than a year, the school and the lacrosse players were thrust into a media frenzy, subjected to intense public scrutiny and damaging allegations of sexual assault that were ultimately dropped.  After Mangum’s confession, Duke told CNN on Friday it would not comment. The former players did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.  Here’s how the events unfolded.  A timeline of the events  • March 13, 2006: Mangum is hired as a dancer for a private party held by members of the Duke men’s lacrosse team. It takes place at a house on North Buchanan Boulevard in Durham. Mangum later accuses several players of raping her during the party early on March 14.  • March 28, 2006: Duke President Richard Brodhead suspends team play for the men’s lacrosse team, a move widely criticized as premature since no formal charges had been made yet. Media attention intensifies, with early reports painting a picture of privileged, White lacrosse players being accused by a Black woman. The case becomes a flashpoint for issues of race, class and privilege, according to the Washington Post.  • March 28-30, 2006: DNA tests on Mangum’s body fail to link any of the lacrosse players to the scene, according to a disciplinary order against prosecutor Mike Nifong by the North Carolina State Bar, but Nifong insists on moving forward with the case. Skepticism about the case begins to mount.  • April 18, 2006: Nifong formally charges Seligmann and Finnerty with rape, according to the disciplinary order. The charges are based largely on Mangum’s testimony, as forensic evidence was either inconclusive or absent.  • May 15, 2006: Nifong formally charges Evans with rape, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 5, 2006: Duke announces the lacrosse team is reinstated to play in the following fall, but public sentiment has already soured.  • December 28, 2006: Nifong is accused of withholding evidence and making misleading statements to the press, leading to an investigation by the state bar, according to the disciplinary order.  • April 11, 2007: Roy Cooper – then the state’s Attorney General and now its governor – announces “there is insufficient evidence to proceed on any of the charges” in a statement shared by Duke Athletics. The charges are dropped.  “We believe that these cases were the result of a tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations,” Cooper said. “Based on the significant inconsistencies between the evidence and the various accounts given by the accusing witness, we believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges.”  • June 16, 2007: Nifong loses his law license following disciplinary hearings about his handling of the case, including accusations of ethical misconduct and withholding evidence. His disbarment is finalized by the state bar in July, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 18, 2007: Duke announces that it has settled with the three lacrosse players, agreeing to pay a confidential settlement.  “It is impossible to fully describe what we, our families and team endured. As we said from day one, we are innocent,” Evans, Finnerty and Seligmann said in a statement. “But it took three hundred and ninety-four days, and the intervention of the North Carolina Attorney General, before our innocence was formally declared.”  • October 5, 2007: The three players file a civil lawsuit against the city of Durham, Nifong and other individuals, according to court documents. Durham later settles the lawsuit in part with a one-time grant of $50,000 to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.  • April 3, 2011: Mangum is charged with stabbing her boyfriend, leading to a lengthy criminal trial, and is convicted of second-degree murder in 2013.  ‘I hope they can forgive me’  Mangum has spent 11 years in prison, which she is getting through by reading the Bible and finding humor in her thoughts, she said in her interview with “Let’s Talk with Kat.”  She wishes she could help children who were sexually abused, she told DePasquale. When asked if she could describe her experience in prison in one word, she says: “Growth.”  Before becoming an exotic dancer, she studied psychology at North Carolina Central University. The transition came from her searching for “validation,” she said in the interview.  “I was looking for love and acceptance from people,” she said. “People to love me, to accept me, to pay attention to me for validation. But you can get all of that in Jesus. He loves us just the way we are. That’s what I learned in prison.  “I hurt my brothers and I hope they can forgive me and I want them to know that I love them and they didn’t deserve that and I hope they can forgive me. I hope they can heal.”  The danger of false rape allegations for actual victims  An advocate for victims of sexual assault said rare cases like this might discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and cause people to wrongly doubt them.  “False reports hurt not only the people falsely accused, they hurt every rape victim,” Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, vice president of communications for RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, told CNN. “There are already too many victims who do not report the crime for fear of not being believed. After a false report in such a high-profile case, even more survivors may be reluctant to come forward out of fear that law enforcement will not believe them.”  A study published by Violence Against Women in 2010 found that false sexual assault reports range from between 2 to 10 percent. A majority of sexual assaults, an estimated 63 percent, are never reported to the police, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.  Kaleba said she encourages people to consider the nearly half million victims in the US of rape and sexual assault each year who may now face renewed disbelief and question the value of reporting sexual violence.  “Don’t allow infrequent, false reporting to stand in the way of standing with survivors,” Kaleba said.",US,Duke lacrosse scandal: Crystal Mangum admits to false rape allegations,,,,0.186,0.723,0.091,-0.9993
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor.",US,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,,,,0.113,0.794,0.093,-0.9676
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/kirstin-lobato-las-vegas-verdict/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"Las Vegas AP —  A federal jury in Nevada has awarded more than $34 million to a woman who was arrested at age 18, wrongly convicted twice, and served nearly 16 years in a Nevada state prison for a 2001 killing she did not commit.  Kirstin Lobato, who is now 41 and uses the name Blaise, cried and hugged her attorneys after a judge read the trial verdict Thursday in US District Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  “It’s been an uphill battle with many, many obstacles,” she told reporters. “And I’m happy that it’s all finally finished.”  Lobato said she didn’t know if becoming a millionaire would make up for years in prison, adding that she had “no idea what the rest of my life is going to look like.”  The civil trial jury found Las Vegas police and two detectives, now retired, fabricated evidence during their investigation and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Lobato. The panel determined that Lobato should receive $34 million in compensatory damages from the department and $10,000 in punitive damages from each former detective.  The detectives, Thomas Thowsen and James LaRochelle, and their attorney, Craig Anderson, declined to comment outside court. Anderson told US District Judge Richard Boulware he planned to file additional court documents following the verdict. Anderson said Friday an appeal was “likely.”  The department previously agreed to pay damages if the jury ruled in Lobato’s favor.  Lobato was 18 when she was interviewed by police without an attorney, arrested and charged with killing Duran Bailey in Las Vegas in July 2001. Bailey, who had been homeless, was found dead near a trash bin with a slashed neck, cracked skull and missing genitals.  No physical evidence or witnesses connected Lobato to the killing, and she maintained she never met Bailey. But police maintained she confessed in jail that she had killed a man who tried to rape her during a three-day methamphetamine binge.  Lobato was 19 when she was convicted of murder in 2002. The Nevada Supreme Court threw out that verdict and Lobato’s prison sentence in 2004 because her lawyers weren’t able to cross-examine a prosecution witness who testified that Lobato made the jailhouse confession.  Lobato was tried again in 2006, convicted of manslaughter, mutilation and weapon charges, and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.  She was exonerated and freed from prison in late 2017 after the Innocence Project and attorneys in Las Vegas again took her case to the state Supreme Court. Justices said evidence showed that Lobato was in her hometown of Panaca, Nevada, some 150 miles from Las Vegas when Bailey was killed.  Last October, a state court judge in Las Vegas issued a certificate declaring Lobato innocent of Bailey’s killing.  That action was challenged by Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson in a letter asking state Attorney General Aaron Ford to investigate how and why attorneys for Lobato acquired the certificate of innocence.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/baby-garnet-cold-case-michigan/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  It was the middle of Jenna Gerwatowski’s workday at the local flower shop in Newberry, Michigan, when she got a call from an unknown number.  The now 23-year-old doesn’t usually answer unknown calls, but says she decided to pick this one up in May 2022.  To her surprise, it was a detective from the Michigan state police.  “He was like, ‘Have you heard of the Baby Garnet case?’” Jenna told CNN.  Jenna had heard of it. In 1997, a deceased infant was found in a campground pit toilet at the Garnet Lake Campground – right where Jenna grew up. Investigators couldn’t find any leads on the identity of the baby or anyone who witnessed a person abandoning an infant, according to a news release from the Michigan attorney general’s office. The case went cold, and the “Baby Garnet” case became a known murder mystery in Jenna’s small town for decades.  “Your DNA was a match,” Jenna says the detective on the phone told her. She was related to the dead infant from 1997.  Jenna was in shock. The detective sounded sure, Jenna said, but she wondered how he had even obtained her DNA.  About six months earlier, her friend had gotten a FamilyTreeDNA test for Christmas and Jenna decided to order her own. DNA from other Baby Garnet relatives led detectives to Jenna’s FamilyTreeDNA kit, according to court documents.  Jenna Gerwatowski, left, says the case was always a big mystery in her town. She had no idea the grandmother she'd never met, Nancy Gerwatowski, right, could be behind it. Jenna Rose Gerwatowski/Mackinac County Sheriff's Office  The detective said a woman from Identifinders International, a genetic genealogy investigation firm, would call her about her DNA to help with identifying closer relatives, according to Jenna.  According to court documents, detectives reopened the cold case in 2017 and then worked with a forensics company to extract DNA from Baby Garnet’s partial femur, before sending the results to Identifinders International.  Jenna explained the situation to her mother when she got home from work.  “It was just crazy,” Jenna said. “We were both sitting there like, I don’t even know who (the mother or father) could’ve been. We were both so confused and we’re like, it’s got to be somebody that we don’t know, you know, like a distant cousin or something.”  Jenna said her mother, Kara Gerwatowski, started to wonder whether the detective call was a scam.  Jenna’s grandfather had just been scammed by someone claiming to be a detective, so Kara told Jenna to be cautious about giving out personal information or passwords.  Misty Gillis, then a senior forensic genealogist and cold case liaison from Identifinders International, called Jenna that night, according to Jenna and court documents filed later in the case.  Jenna claims Gillis requested her FamilyTreeDNA password to be able to upload her DNA into a separate database. Jenna was concerned it was a scammer and refused to cooperate, according to court documents.  “I hung up the phone on her, not even thinking twice about it. And we went about our day. I was like, how weird. What a weird thing to scam people about,” Jenna said. “I wholeheartedly did not think that it was real.”  One week later, Jenna was working at the flower shop when she got a distressed call from her mother.  “She was like, ‘I really need you to come home. … It’s an emergency. Like, just please come as soon as you can,’” Jenna said.  Jenna rushed home thinking someone died. Her cousin was sitting with her mom at their round wooden kitchen table. Police had contacted her cousin, who works as a victim’s advocate in the county prosecutor’s office, to explain the Baby Garnet situation to Jenna. It turned out it wasn’t a scam.  “My mom had tears in her eyes,” she said. Jenna’s cousin had “just pure shock on her face. … You could hear a pin drop in there.”  Even though Jenna knew she had nothing to do with the Baby Garnet case, she was terrified police would think she was trying to hide something because of her refusal to speak with Gillis. She immediately called her.  An analysis of Jenna’s DNA kit showed she was the half-niece to Baby Garnet, according to court records.  On June 1, 2022, detectives spoke with her mother, Kara, who agreed to provide her DNA. Kara was the half-sister of Baby Garnet, according to court records.  “I feel like that is when, like, all of the puzzle pieces kind of started falling together for her,” Jenna said. “And she told detectives that, if it’s going to be anybody, it would be (her) mother.”  Kara, now 42, had not spoken with her mother, Nancy Gerwatowski, since she was 18 because they had a bad relationship, and Jenna had never met her grandmother. Regardless, both were shocked Nancy, who was living in Wyoming when police questioned her, would be the one behind their town mystery.  “I had grown up knowing about the case my whole life and then come to find out it was my grandma that did it?” Jenna said.  The Michigan attorney general’s office alleges Nancy “delivered the newborn alone at her Newberry home, during which Baby Garnet died due to asphyxiation, and that this death could have been prevented by medical intervention (Nancy) Gerwatowski did not seek.”  However, in a court filing, Nancy’s defense argues she unexpectedly gave birth while in the bathtub and the fetus “became trapped inside her birth canal.” She “attempted to pull the fetus out of her own body,” the filing says, but couldn’t deliver the fetus and lost consciousness “at some point in the delivery.” When she was finally able to deliver the fetus, it was dead, the filing says.  Her defense argues that Nancy, like the average person in the county in 1997, did not have access to a telephone or cell line, so she couldn’t call 911. While she concedes in her legal filings she placed the stillborn fetus in a bag and left the remains at the campground, her defense attorneys argue she had been in shock after having had no pain medication during the traumatic birth.  Nancy is charged with one count each of open murder, involuntary manslaughter, and concealing the death of an individual. Open murder carries a potential life sentence.  In a hearing on Thursday, Nancy’s defense argued that the case against her should be dropped in its entirety because the state cannot prove the baby was born alive. If the court allows the case to proceed, the defense argued, Nancy’s statements during police interrogation should be excluded because she was denied her right to counsel — a contention the state disputed. If the court does allow her statements to be a part of the trial, Nancy’s lawyers want her comments about considering an abortion and not seeking out prenatal care to be excluded, while the state argued the comments are relevant to possible motive.  Judge Brian D. Rahilly said he hopes to reach a decision on whether or not to drop the charges by next week or around the end of the year at the latest.  “It was a very hard time … very traumatizing and very nerve-wracking,” said Jenna. “I’ve never met this woman, so it was hard for me to even grasp that concept, but even harder for my mom because that was her mother.”",US,Baby Garnet cold case update: A DNA test helped solve a 1997 Michigan murder,,,,0.144,0.794,0.061,-0.9991
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-thursday-hnk/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  Marked shell casings from the assassination scene match the gun found on the suspect. His fingerprints match some key items investigators found nearby. And he was arrested this week – after going silent from his mom and friends for months – with a fake ID and a handwritten “claim of responsibility” referencing the crime site.  These details and others, shared by law enforcement and people who know suspect Luigi Mangione, have been mounting since last week’s daylight killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a busy sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of the investigation into Thompson’s killing, sources tell CNN.  A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN at least two of the warrants include the backpack found in Central Park and the burner phone found along the getaway route police believe Mangione took from the shooting scene. Investigators also searched the hostel where suspected killer Mangione stayed the night before the shooting and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  After a five-day, multi-state manhunt that leaned heavily on surveillance images and pleas for the public’s help, Mangione, 26, is now charged in the case with murder after a tip led to his arrest Monday at a McDonald’s nearly 200 miles from where the brazen homicide unfolded.  Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury in the case against Mangione, sources told ABC News.  Mangione was charged in a felony arrest warrant earlier this week. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  Blair County Judge David Consiglio scheduled a hearing in Pennsylvania on December 30 in response to Mangione’s petitions for writ of habeas corpus and imposition of bail, court documents from Thursday show.  Mangione was denied bail on Tuesday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania. The habeas corpus petition is a key factor in whether the suspect can be extradited to New York.  Mangione’s team was given two weeks from Tuesday to file the habeas corpus petition, which challenges Pennsylvania’s ability to prove that Mangione is the person the state of New York has issued the arrest warrant for, according to Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.  Mangione is also set to appear in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, court on December 23 for a preliminary hearing related to state charges.  Mangione’s lawyer has denied his client’s involvement in the December 4 killing and anticipates he will plead not guilty to the murder and other charges in New York, as well as to charges related to the 3D-printed gun and fake ID in Pennsylvania, where he was caught and is being held without bond.  Defense attorney Thomas Dickey on Wednesday also dismissed the ballistics and fingerprint evidence revealed publicly hours earlier, saying he wants to examine it himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”  Thomas Dickey, attorney for suspected shooter Luigi Mangione, speaks Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “As lawyers, we need to see it. We need to see: How did they collect it? How much of it? And then we would have our experts … take a look at that, and then we would challenge its admissibility and challenge the accuracy of those results.”  Still, New York’s governor expects a murder indictment “to be issued any day now, and the second that happens, I’m issuing a warrant for extradition.”  “It feels like the evidence is very compelling,” Gov. Kathy Hochul told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. “I trust the DA here in Manhattan to make sure that he puts forth an indictment that is going to be iron-clad.”  Meanwhile, Hochul is unimpressed by the folk hero status Mangione has attained on social media as the killing of Thompson – a husband and father of two – has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry.  Mangione appears to have been driven by anger against the industry and “corporate greed” as a whole, states a New York Police Department intelligence report that also warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  “That horrific attack occurred on our streets,” Hochul said Thursday. “And the people of our city deserve to have that sense of calm that this perpetrator has been caught, and he will be never seeing the late of day again if there is justice.”  “You cannot assassinate an individual on the streets of New York – not now, not ever.”  Neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said on Thursday.  Suspect hadn’t spoken to mother since July  Until he was found Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Mangione had gone quiet from at least a few people who appear to have been close with him. The scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, he had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  Mangione’s mother had reported him missing November 18 – two weeks before Thompson’s killing – a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. She called police in San Francisco, where she knew her son had been living, and told authorities she’d called his phone repeatedly to find the voicemail full and not taking any more messages.  Mangione’s mom had no reason to believe her son was a danger to himself or others, she told the San Francisco Police Department, but she hadn’t actually spoken with him since July 1, the official said. He had worked remotely at TrueCar, she also said, where the phone was disconnected and the offices closed, the official added.  It also doesn’t appear Mangione had posted anything since midsummer to social media, where posts addressed to his X account suggest some of his friends have been trying to get in touch with him.  In July, a user tweeted at Mangione, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding. In late November, just weeks before the shooting, another user posted at Mangione, “thinking of you and prayers everyday in your name. Know you are missed and loved.”  As Mangione entered a Pennsylvania courthouse this week, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, he yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Suspected shooter Luigi Mangione is led from the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “He’s irritated, agitated about what’s happening to him and what he’s being accused of,” Dickey told CNN of Mangione’s outburst and struggle with police.  “He never had any legal representation until he walked into that building yesterday. And I talked to him … look at the difference between when he went in and when he came out … now he has a spokesperson and someone that’s going to fight for him.”  Suspect linked to fingerprints and gun  Police in New York on Wednesday publicly revealed the first positive forensic match and direct physical evidence tying Mangione to Thompson’s killing, law enforcement officials told CNN.  “We got the gun in question back from Pennsylvania. It’s now at the NYPD crime lab,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “We were able to match that gun to the three shell casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of the homicide.”  A 3D-printed gun was in Mangione’s possession when he was arrested Monday, police have said.  The three 9 mm shell casings had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, one word per bullet, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Police have been looking into whether those words, which match the title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry, may point to a motive in the killing.  Authorities also had been probing DNA material and a partial fingerprint from a discarded Starbucks water bottle and an energy bar wrapper surveillance images showed the suspect buying about 30 minutes before the shooting. Mangione’s fingerprints were confirmed as a match, Tisch said  Along with the prints and ballistics, investigators have been examining writings police have said Mangione had upon arrest, including a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility.” It did not include specific threats but indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday.  In some writings, he referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny added. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  Investigators also are looking at the suspect’s writing in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.  It included to-do lists to facilitate a killing, as well as notes justifying those plans, the source said. In one notebook passage, Mangione wrote about the late Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber who justified a deadly bombing campaign as an effort to protect against the onslaught of technology and exploitation. Mangione had written about the Unabomber in online posts as well.  In a notebook passage, Mangione concludes using a bomb against his intended victim “could kill innocents” and shooting would be more targeted, musing what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/hannah-kobayashi-found-update-father/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  Hannah Kobayashi “has been found safe,” her family said Wednesday, more than a week after police declared her voluntarily missing amid fears she may have been abducted.  “We are incredibly relieved and grateful that Hannah has been found safe,” Kobayashi’s sister, Sydni, and mother, Brandi Yee, said. “This past month has been an unimaginable ordeal for our family, and we kindly ask for privacy as we take the time to heal and process everything we have been through.”  The statement was posted on X by the family’s lawyer, Sara Azari. The statement did not indicate where Kobayashi was or how the family determined she was safe.  The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement they are “happy to learn that Hannah has been found safe” and due to the new information “this has become a private matter and we will wrap up our investigation.”  The family had launched a GoFundMe that raised over $47,000 to help find Hannah. Donations have been turned off, and donors who would like a refund can submit a claim, the family said.  Hannah Kobayashi arrived at Los Angeles International Airport from Maui on November 8, but did not board her connecting flight to New York, her sister previously told CNN. The family last heard from the 30-year-old on November 11 after spending four days in Los Angeles at various locations, according to video footage and photos.

She was declared a missing person on November 15.  More than three weeks after she left Maui, Los Angeles police declared her as a voluntary missing person on December 2. Video surveillance from US Customs and Border Protection “clearly shows” Hannah Kobayashi crossing the US-Mexico border just after noon on November 12 at the San Ysidro port of entry, police said.  “To date the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a news conference. “She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her.”  Volunteers put up flyers of missing Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi outside Crypto.com Arena in Downtown Los Angeles. Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images/File  Before leaving Maui, investigators found Hannah Kobayashi had expressed a desire to disconnect from modern technology, police said.  Tragedy struck the family during their search for Hannah Kobayashi when her father Ryan Kobayashi, who had traveled from Hawaii to Los Angeles to help look for her, was found dead November 24 near the airport, having taken his own life, the family and authorities say.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/louisville-police-reform-breonna-taylor/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"Louisville, Kentucky AP —  The US Justice Department and the city of Louisville have reached an agreement to reform the city’s police force after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, officials said Thursday.  The consent decree, which must be approved by a judge, follows a federal investigation that found Louisville police have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the “historic content decree” will build upon and accelerate, this transformational police reform we have already begun in Louisville.” He noted that “significant improvements” have already been implemented since Taylor’s death in March 2020. That includes a city law banning the use of “no-knock” warrants.  The Justice Department report released in March 2023 said the Louisville police department “discriminates against Black people in its enforcement activities,” uses excessive force and conducts searches based on invalid warrants. It also said the department violates the rights of people engaged in protests.  “This conduct harmed community members and undermined public trust in law enforcement that is essential for public safety,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This consent decree marks a new day for Louisville.”  Once the consent decree is agreed upon, a federal officer will monitor the progress made by the city.  The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened 12 civil rights investigations into law enforcement agencies, but this is the first that has reached a consent decree. The Justice Department and the city of Springfield, Massachusetts announced an agreement in 2022 but the investigation into that police department was opened under President Donald Trump’s first administration.  City officials in Memphis have taken a different approach, pushing against the need for a Justice Department consent decree to enact reforms in light of a federal investigation launched after Tyre Nichols’ killing that found Memphis officers routinely use unwarranted force and disproportionately target Black people. Memphis officials have not ruled eventually agreeing to a consent decree, but have said the city can make changes more effectively without committing to a binding pact.  It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department’s priorities around civil rights.",US,"DOJ, Louisville reach deal after probe prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor",,,,0.054,0.79,0.156,0.9902
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  Weeks of mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey are prompting heightened security concerns – and mounting frustrations – from residents, military personnel and federal, state and local officials.  While the state’s governor says there’s no threat to public safety, other state officials and local mayors are alarmed.  “I’m legitimately concerned for what the hell is going on because nobody knows,” state Assemblyman Brian Bergen told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey after a briefing at state police headquarters on Wednesday.  “We are literally being invaded by drones. We have no idea who is doing it and where they’re coming from,” Pequannock Mayor Ryan Herb told the station after the briefing.  Law enforcement has not identified the origin or landing sites of the drones, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday. He added that the drones primarily operate at night, often displaying flashing lights, but they turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached.  According to Melham, the drones have eluded radar detection, possibly because they do not emit frequencies or possess evasion capabilities.  He also raised alarm over where some of the drones have been spotted.  “One of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey’s critical infrastructure,” Melham said.  The mayor of West Milford, Michele Dale, reported 60 drones hovering over local reservoirs.  Some members of Congress have speculated that a foreign entity may be involved in the drones, something the Pentagon rebuffed Wednesday.  The denial came hours after US Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, told Fox News the drones were from “a mothership” from Iran that is “off the East Coast of the United States of America.”  “There is not any truth to that,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.”  Meanwhile, US Northern Command, which oversees the Defense Department’s homeland security efforts, said in statement Wednesday that it had “conducted a deliberate analysis of the events” regarding the drone sightings but had not been asked “to assist with these events.”  A spokesperson for the US Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged an encounter by one of its assets with the drones.  “Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  The aircraft were not seen as an immediate threat and did not interfere with operations, Pinneo added.  CNN reached out to the Coast Guard but did not receive an immediate response.  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told WBGO on Wednesday the public should feel secure while acknowledging their fears.  “Based on everything we know, there is no public safety risks we’re aware of,” Murphy said.  “Is it frustrating to have no answers? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes,” the governor told the radio station.  The sightings began November 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. At times, large drones — some up to 6 feet in diameter — were seen nightly in New Jersey from dusk until 11 p.m., with sightings ranging from 4 to 180, according to state lawmakers who attended the briefing Wednesday.  The drones operate in a coordinated manner, turning off their lights to evade detection, complicating tracking efforts. They are not identified as hobbyist drones or linked to the Department of Homeland Security, State Assembly member Dawn Fantasia said on X.  The FBI is leading the investigation with the New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, while the US Coast Guard is assessing jurisdictional responses.  Federal agencies have ruled out any connections of local, state, or federal governments to the sightings.  Melham called for a temporary flight ban on all personnel and commercial drones in his video update, despite official advisories against such measures.  Concerns escalated after drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to military officials and state lawmakers. The sightings prompted the FAA to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.  Unnerved residents have described frequently seeing the drones hovering overhead, sometimes traveling in clusters.  While visiting family in New Jersey, travel content creator Katie Caf initially doubted reports of drones until she spotted several moving in a “zigzagging” pattern on Saturday. The 29-year-old noticed five potential drones, which she described as being the size of a bicycle. “They’re so weird looking and they’re much bigger than normal drones. I get why everyone is freaking out now … I think it’s kinda spooky.”  Fantasia said on X that the briefing occurred Wednesday at the New Jersey State Police headquarters and included descriptions of the aircraft’s movements and federal agencies’ response.  Though Murphy has said there is no known threat to the public, Fantasia and other local leaders have expressed doubt and are demanding more transparency into the investigation.  US Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, pushed for more information from federal investigators in a letter sent Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  “I recognize the need to maintain operational security of ongoing investigations and that this situation requires complex interagency coordination,” Booker wrote. “However, there is a growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state – from constituents and local officials alike – despite assurances that the drones pose no known threats to public safety.”  The FBI in Newark has asked the public to report any information related to the drones, including in several areas along the Raritan River.  “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI field office in Newark said December 3.  During a US Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday, Robert Wheeler, assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, called the phenomenon “concerning” but said “there is nothing that is known” that would lead him to identify a public safety risk.  CNN has sought more information from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and New Jersey State Police.  This story has been updated with additional information.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/university-of-mississippi-student-killing-mistrial/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"AP —  A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the case of Sheldon “Timothy” Herrington Jr. in the 2022 killing of Jimmie “Jay” Lee, a gay man who was prominent in the LGBTQ+ community at the University of Mississippi.  Jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict after over nine and a half hours of deliberation.  Lee’s body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead.  Herrington, 24, showed little emotion as he left the courtroom with his attorneys and several relatives. He remains free on bond and is still charged with capital murder, which Mississippi law defines as a killing committed along with another felony — in this case, kidnapping. Prosecutors had said they would not seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison if he is tried again and convicted.  Jurors on Wednesday were told they could also consider lesser charges of first-degree murder, punishable by life in prison; second-degree murder, 20 years to life; or manslaughter, up to 20 years.  University of Mississippi student Jimmie ""Jay"" Lee is seen in this undated image. Oxford Police Police Department  Circuit Judge Kelly Luther said he will consult with prosecutors and defense attorneys about setting another trial.  Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee, 20, was pursuing a master’s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.  Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, where the university is located and the trial was held.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee vanished. Investigators testified that they used warrants to obtain electronic records including explicit messages between social media accounts belonging to the two men and online searches conducted by Herrington, including one inquiring how long it takes to strangle someone.  Prosecutors said during closing arguments Wednesday that Herrington and Lee had a sexual encounter that ended badly and Lee left Herrington’s apartment. They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex. Prosecutors said Lee was killed after going back.  “Tim Herrington lived a lie — lived a lie to his family,” District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. “He lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.”  Herrington’s attorney, Kevin Horan, has said prosecutors cannot prove Lee is dead without having a body. He told jurors Wednesday that text messages showed Herrington did not lure Lee to his apartment.

Bruce Newman/Pool/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal/AP  “He’s the one that’s being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,” Horan said of Lee.  Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.  Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained explicit messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.  Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched “how long does it take to strangle someone” at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.  The final text message from Lee’s phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington’s apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee’s phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee’s car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.  On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.  Herrington’s relatives sat behind him in the courtroom, and Lee’s sat behind prosecutors. When Luther dismissed court after the mistrial, he instructed the two groups to leave separately.  Jurors were chosen from another county about 250 miles to the south. They heard eight days of arguments and testimony.  The judge twice urged jurors to continue deliberating when they said they were deadlocked. After the third such message, Luther declared the mistrial and thanked them for serving, adding: “I’ve asked a lot of you.”",US,Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee: Judge declares mistrial after jury deadlocks over killing of gay University of Mississippi student,,,,0.136,0.808,0.056,-0.9977
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/us/timeline-luigi-magione-ceo-shooting/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  As investigators work to piece together the possible motive and movements of 26-year-old Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione, suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, here’s what we know.  This timeline is based on information from law enforcement sources, official police releases, surveillance images and social media records.  Summer of 2024  Mangione had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  During the summer, Mangione appears to stop posting online, prompting worried messages from some of his friends.  In July, one user posts on X, tagging Mangione, saying, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding.  Mid-November  Mangione’s mother reports her son missing in San Francisco, law enforcement officials said.  Sunday, November 24  10:11 p.m. – Mangione arrives in New York at the Port Authority bus terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue via a bus that originated in Atlanta, then gets into a cab that takes him to the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, where he stays about half an hour.  There was an interaction while the suspect was checking in at the hostel, making casual conversation. ""At some point, he pulled his mask down and smiled at the at the clerk,"" said Joseph Kenny, NYPD chief of detectives. NYPD  11 p.m. – He takes another cab to a hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave. on the Upper West Side, identified as HI New York City Hostel in charging documents.  11:20 p.m. - Surveillance footage from the hostel shows him checking in and showing a driver’s license, according to the arrest warrant in the case. Records from the hostel show he provided a New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario on it, the warrant says.  Friday, November 29  Mangione checks out of the hostel.  “It’s not your traditional check in, check out. It’s the kind of thing where if you don’t show up at a certain time, they automatically just check you out,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. “We don’t believe that he went someplace else.

Wednesday, December 4  5:34 a.m. – Surveillance footage reviewed by law enforcement shows Mangione leaving the hostel, possibly by bike.  5:41 a.m. – He is seen wandering around the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown, on Sixth Avenue between West 53rd and 54th Streets, and goes back and forth for a bit before heading toward a Starbucks.  “We have him wandering around, walking in the vicinity of hotel, walking on 54th Street, walking back and forth,” Kenny said.  Around 6:17 a.m. – Images from Starbucks show him buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, according to a law enforcement official.

Gideon Platt, Stage Star Deli  6:30 a.m. – Around 6:30 a.m., surveillance video captures what appears to be the gunman on the phone.  Patrick Laborde  6:44 a.m. – Thompson, the victim, walks toward the Hilton after leaving his hotel across the street, police said.  The masked gunman is “lying in wait” outside the hotel as Thompson makes his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.  The gunman comes up behind Thompson and shoots him in the back, Kenny said. He then walks toward Thompson and continues to shoot, stopping to clear a gun jam before firing again.  Obtained by CNN  Investigators told CNN that after the shooting, the assailant crosses the street from the Hilton, flees northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street, and gets on an electric bike on 55th Street before heading north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.  Obtained by CNN  6:48 a.m. – Mangione is seen riding an electric bike into Central Park at 60th Street, according to Kenny.  NYPD  6:56 a.m. – He rides out of the park.  6:58 a.m. - He is seen on the bike at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue.  7:00 a.m. - He is no longer on the bike and is heading northbound on 86th Street.  7:04 a.m. - Mangione gets into a cab.  7:30 a.m. – He is seen near the George Washington Bridge and a Port Authority bus station off 178th Street.  Video shows the suspect entering the bus station.  “We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” Kenny said.  5-Day Manhunt  The suspect was in Pennsylvania for “several days” after the shooting in Manhattan, according to Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police.  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the suspect traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in Altoona, where he is arrested.  Monday, December 9  In a new post on social media, Pennsylvania State Police shared new images of Luigi Mangione sitting inside the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was captured on Monday. The images show Mangione eating what appears to be a hash brown inside the establishment. Pennsylvania State Police  9:14 a.m. - Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania are dispatched to a McDonald’s restaurant, after an employee tipped off police about someone resembling photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police.  9:58 a.m. - Mangione is taken into custody at the McDonald’s, where he presented police with a forged New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario as his identification – the same ID he presented at the hostel, according to the arrest warrant.  Mangione was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea in his first court appearance in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, later that day.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/us/wisconsin-kayaker-fake-death-in-custody/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"Green Lake, Wisconsin AP —  A Wisconsin man who faked his own drowning and left his wife and three children to go to Eastern Europe is in police custody, online records show.  Ryan Borgwardt, 45, was booked into the Green Lake County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system, a service that provides information to crime victims such as a person’s jail custody status. No charges were listed.  The Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday in a social media post that a news conference would be held Wednesday morning to update the Borgwardt case. The post said no further information would be provided until then.  A person answering the phone at the sheriff’s office Tuesday night declined to confirm whether Borgwardt was in custody. County jail officials didn’t immediately return a phone message Tuesday night.  Last month, Sheriff Mark Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on November 11 after disappearing for three months but that he hadn’t committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were “pulling at his heartstrings” to come home. He suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance.  Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of “personal matters,” the sheriff said. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it’s the deepest in Wisconsin.  After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane.  The sheriff said at the time that investigators were working to verify Borgwardt’s description of what happened.  The sheriff’s office has said the search for Borgwardt’s body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn’t expect the search to last more than two weeks.",US,"Ryan Borgwardt: Wisconsin kayaker who faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe is in custody, online records show",,,,0.06,0.933,0.007,-0.9398

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-administration-big-donors/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  Nearly three dozen of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks to serve in his incoming administration donated to his campaign or to the deep-pocketed outside groups that worked to elect him, a CNN analysis of federal campaign records shows.  They range from tech multibillionaire Elon Musk – who has emerged as the single largest, disclosed political donor of the 2024 presidential election – to others close to Trump tapped for key roles throughout government.  In all, eight of his Cabinet picks – led by Linda McMahon, the billionaire wrestling magnate Trump has selected to oversee the Education Department – and their spouses donated more than $37 million combined from their personal accounts to aid Trump, the review found, underscoring the proliferation of ultra-rich Americans now poised to shape US policy in the incoming second Trump administration.  (Two other Cabinet choices, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, transferred money from their campaign accounts to the pro-Trump effort.)  Musk has not been selected for a formal Cabinet job but is helping guide a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative and has played a pivotal role in the presidential transition – offering his views on job candidates, talking to world leaders and meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as he weighs how to downsize the federal government.  In all, the SpaceX and Tesla chief executive donated more than $277 million to federal elections this cycle, the lion’s share of which – more than $262 million – benefited Trump. Most of Musk’s pro-Trump dollars flowed to a super PAC that the world’s richest man created to help turn out voters on the Republican’s behalf in key swing states.  Outside of self-funded presidential candidates, no individual has donated more to shape federal contests in a single election cycle, said Brendan Glavin, research director of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes money in politics.  Trump’s donors “are not just getting these sort of plum ambassadorships on the side,” Glavin said. “Major donors are getting positions that affect policy.”  The CNN analysis researched the more than 90 people that Trump had announced for high-level positions in the administration through Tuesday, which marked five weeks since his election victory. More than 30 of them had donated to his campaign or to one of the leading Trump-aligned outside groups, the review of FEC records found.  “Millions of Americans fed up with failure in the White House and federal government joined President Trump in the movement to restore our nation’s greatness. Some who will work with President Trump are among those millions of people who supported the campaign and helped the President win a decisive electoral victory,” Brian Hughes, a Trump transition team spokesman, said in a statement in response to CNN’s inquiry about donors joining the administration.  The total donations from Trump’s current Cabinet picks marks a surge from Trump’s first term. Five members of his original Cabinet had donated nearly $8 million to his committees or to the major outside groups supporting him, a review of campaign reports shows.  Donations from McMahon, who served as Trump’s SBA administrator in his first White House term, accounted for more than 90% of that total in the 2016 election.  The sums spent to aid Trump in 2024 far exceed the donations that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet members contributed to help him win the White House in 2020, FEC records show.  A dozen members of Biden’s Cabinet reported donations to his campaign or major super PACs involved in the 2020 election, giving less than $100,000 in total.  Billionaires in the administration  Musk’s spending dwarfed that of other supporters.  McMahon was the largest donor among Trump’s Cabinet picks and the second most generous contributor, after Musk, among the administration members announced through Tuesday, the review found.  Most of the $21.2 million she donated went to Make American Great Again, Inc., the main Trump-affiliated super PAC that spent heavily on advertising to aid his campaign.  Other seven-figure donors among Trump’s Cabinet picks include Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick, whom Trump has tapped to serve as Commerce secretary; Scott Bessent, the hedge fund executive Trump has selected to oversee the Treasury Department; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, his choice to head the Small Business Administration.  Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher, also was a major donor, contributing more than $2 million to the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and Trump’s joint fundraising committee.  Sprecher is the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and was at Trump’s side when the president-elect rang the opening bell at the exchange Thursday.  In an email, Loeffler’s communication director Caitlin O’Dea said, “Senator Loeffler is proud to be one of President Trump’s strongest supporters for the same reason a historic landslide of Americans voted to put him back in the White House: he will restore American prosperity, security, and opportunity.”  The billionaire embrace marks a turnaround of sorts for Trump, who saw corporate America recoil from him after the violent January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And he has seen new support from tech leaders who are pushing for fewer regulations from the federal government.  The staggering sums spent by Musk in this year’s election helped Trump close the financial advantage of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who swiftly raised $1 billion after becoming her party’s standard-bearer in late July.  Super PACs face no limit on the size of donations they can receive or spend, but technically are not allowed coordinate their advertising decisions with the candidates they support.  However, a ruling this year by the FEC granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing efforts freed up Musk to guide a ground game for Trump.  “The campaign finance system is a joke,” said Fred Wertheimer, who heads the Democracy 21 watchdog group and is a longtime advocate for limits on money in politics. “Musk is the example now of how campaign finance laws have failed.”  He said he worries about government departments led by billionaires who have no “interest in doing the job that the agency was assigned.”  Musk did not respond to inquiries from CNN.  But Tom Davis, a former congressman from Virginia who chaired the House Republicans’ campaign arm for several years, argues “there is nothing inherently wrong about people who made a lot of money wanting to give back through government.”  “The fact that they have contributed shows a degree of loyalty,” he added.  Friends and family  Presidents often reward donors and allies with plum positions – often dispatching them to glamorous, low-conflict posts in Europe or the Caribbean.  Some of Trump’s early picks for ambassadorships follow that pattern and include billionaires who donated to his reelection effort. Among them: Arkansas investor Warren Stephens, named as the US’ envoy to the UK, and Charles Kushner, Trump’s choice for ambassador to France – one of several extended family members or close friends who has been chosen for diplomatic gigs.  Kushner, who donated $2 million to pro-Trump efforts and received a presidential pardon at the end of Trump’s first term, is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. Another donor, Tom Barrack, who oversaw the fundraising for Trump’s first inauguration, is his choice as ambassador to Turkey.  And incoming special envoy to the Middle East, real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff, is a longtime Trump friend and a partner in the cryptocurrency businesses that Trump launched with his sons earlier this year.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-abc-news-defamation-lawsuit-settle/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  ABC News and George Stephanopoulos have reached a settlement with Donald Trump in his defamation suit. The network will pay $15 million to a charity and will issue an apology.  The settlement was filed publicly Saturday and reveals ABC will pay $15 million as a charitable contribution to a “presidential foundation and museum to be established by or for the Plaintiff.”  The network will also pay $1 million in Trump’s attorneys’ fees.  Trump filed the lawsuit in Florida federal court earlier this year, arguing that Stephanopoulos and ABC News defamed him when the anchor said 10 times during a contentious on-air interview with South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace in March that a jury found Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll.  Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and that he defamed her when he denied her claim. Trump has denied all wrongdoing toward Carroll.  In 2023, a jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, though it did not find that Carroll proved he raped her. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million for batter and defamation. In January, Carroll was awarded an additional $83.3 million in damages for his defamatory statements disparaging her and denying her rape allegations.  The jury did not find that Carroll proved Trump had raped her. Instead, a judge concluded months later when dismissing Trump’s countersuit against Carroll that the claim Trump raped Carroll was “substantially true.” The judge wrote in August 2023 that Trump “raped” her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.  In the lawsuit filed against ABC News in March, Trump claimed that Stephanopoulos’ statements were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.”  The case was allowed to move forward in July, with the judge refusing to dismiss the lawsuit, writing that these definitions were different enough. He added that the case would turn on “whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury’s verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.”  This story is breaking and will be updated.",US,ABC News settles defamation suit with Trump for $15 million,,,,0.156,0.804,0.04,-0.9932
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/antony-blinken-jordan-syria/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"Aqaba, Jordan CNN —  The United States has had direct contact with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Syrian rebel group now in de-facto control of the country, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday.  The first public confirmation of direct interaction with the US-designated terrorist group, known as HTS, came at the conclusion of Blinken’s diplomatic sprint through the region spurred by the sudden collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  “Yes, we’ve been in contact with HTS and the other parties,” Blinken said at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan. Blinken did not give details on when the contact was made or at what level. There is no legal barrier to speaking with a designated terrorist group.  “We have pressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,” Blinken said, referencing the American journalist who was detained in Syria more than a decade ago. The US has redoubled its efforts to find him in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse.  The US also shared the principles expected of a new Syrian government, including that the rights of all Syrians should be respected, that the country must not become a base for terrorism, that humanitarian aid must be delivered, and that chemical weapons stockpiles should be secured and safely destroyed.  Those principles, circulated by the US in the days after Assad’s shocking ouster, were further agreed upon in a joint statement by the US and a coalition of other countries at an urgent ministerial meeting in Aqaba on Saturday. Blinken said the agreement “sends a unified message to the new interim authority and parties in Syria.”  Ahead of the Saturday ministerial meeting, Blinken met with key partners in Jordan, Turkey and Iraq to garner consensus around the principles.  “America and our partners have an important stake in helping the Syrian people chart this new path,” the top US diplomat said Saturday. “We know what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders — from mass displacement to terrorism.”  “We can’t underestimate the challenges of this moment and the weeks and months ahead,” he added.  Throughout his trip, Blinken sought to emphasize those stakes. Moving forward, the dynamics on the ground in the region could present significant complications, despite a consensus on the principles.  There was an intense spate of fighting in recent weeks in northern Syria between Turkish-backed forces and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which the US sees as a key partner in the fight to keep ISIS degraded.  A fragile truce between the two sides in Manbij appears to be holding, but the fighting forced the SDF to halt its anti-ISIS operations, according to its top commander.  “This is a moment of vulnerability in which ISIS will seek to regroup, taking the advantage of transition in Syria,” Blinken said Saturday, reemphasizing the importance of the SDF.  In meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Ankara, Blinken warned the US does not want to see any party take actions that would allow ISIS to regroup, including by distracting the SDF from its mission to keep the terrorist group degraded and its fighters imprisoned, a US official said. Blinken also emphasized that nobody should take actions that could jeopardize factions in Syria from potentially coming together in a unified government.  In Baghdad, Blinken asked Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to crack down on the powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and to prevent Iran from transiting weapons through Iraq to Shia militias in Syria, the US official said. Such militias have targeted US personnel and interests in the past.  The response to Israel’s actions in Syria has also emerged as point of division between the US and its Arab partners.  Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has pummeled Syria with strikes and sent Israeli troops to — and beyond — a “buffer zone” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria, in what the United Nations said would be a violation of a 1974 agreement. Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Qatar have condemned Israel’s seizure of the buffer zone, calling it an attempted land grab.  The US, however, has not condemned the move, with Blinken saying that they are talking with the Israeli government.  “The stated purpose of those actions from the Israelis is to try to make sure that equipment that’s been abandoned — military equipment that’s been abandoned by the Syrian army — doesn’t fall into the wrong hands: terrorists, extremists, etc.,” he said Thursday. “But … we’re already talking with Israel; we’re all talking to others about the way ahead.”  A US official said Friday that Blinken intends to make clear to his Arab counterparts that Israel told the US that the incursion is temporary — and that the US expects it to be. That policy could change, however, next month when the Trump administration takes office, this official conceded.

Pelosi, 84, is receiving “excellent care” from doctors and medical professionals, Ian Krager, the spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday.  The US military had medevaced the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. The medical center is a major military hospital that for years has treated US troops injured in combat.  “While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,” Krager said Friday.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-ban-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  TikTok has plans for another appeal as it faces a ban on January 19.  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected a temporary pause on the ban of TikTok, calling such a block “unwarranted” and paving the way for the Supreme Court to potentially decide the fate of the popular video-sharing app.  In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that required TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, to be sold to a non-Chinese company. The latest ruling follows last week’s decision by the same appeals court to uphold the law, citing national security concerns.  The Biden administration previously urged the appeals court not to issue a temporary block on the law, arguing that doing so might allow the company to wait months to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, effectively halting the law indefinitely.  “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said on December 6.  What will TikTok’s next appeal look like?  The Supreme Court could make a quick decision on the case. Both TikTok and the federal government previously asked the appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the January 19 ban.  But the Supreme Court, which has a six-justice conservative majority, seems likely to rule in favor of upholding the ban, Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN earlier this month.  “I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” Schiller said.  Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN earlier this month that the Supreme Court may decide not to review the case at all, in which case TikTok is out of luck.  Do you need to delete the app?  Not necessarily.  The Department of Justice said Wednesday that, if the ban takes effect, it would “not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok” for the app’s more than 170 million monthly users. But don’t expect any more updates from the app or the ability to download it, if the ban takes place.  Two leaders of the US House of Representatives’ committee on China sent a bipartisan letter to the CEOs of Apple and Google parent company Alphabet that said they should prepare to remove TikTok from their US app stores on January 19.  TikTok will also be unavailable on internet hosting platforms. The Justice Department warned users can expect the app to “eventually” be unworkable.  Can the ban be avoided?  There’s still some hope that TikTok could remain active in the United States, though ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell it.  The ban’s legislation leaves room for Biden to grant a one-time, 90-day extension if he determines a company has made progress toward a sale. He hasn’t suggested any plans to do so.  President-elect Donald Trump, who begins his term a day after the ban, could be on TikTok’s side. He said in July (in a video posted to the app) that he would “never ban TikTok” — although he did try to ban it during his first term.  There are a few options: Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, though experts say that’s unlikely to be successful. He could also direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month.",US,TikTok’s ban won’t be delayed.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-shop-ban/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  Aakaanksh Autade was iffy on TikTok Shop, TikTok’s in-app shopping feature, when it launched last year. Then the content creator grossed over $100,000 in sales when he hosted a live event on Black Friday and went from skeptic to believer.  Autade is known for sharing tech-related tips and tricks on his TikTok channel, “kaansanity.” He took to TikTok Live for the first time on Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend to promote gadgets like headphones and game consoles. “It was my first time going live, and to make $102,000 in 10 hours was just insane. I didn’t expect it at all,” he said.  Aakaanksh Autade (left) promoted gadgets like the Nintendo Switch via TikTok Live on Cyber Monday. Courtesy Aakaanksh Autade/kaansanity  TikTok Shop allows users to buy and sell products without leaving the app. The sales platform combines entertainment and retail, making it particularly popular among Gen Z buyers, and it continues to grow. It has over 500,000 sellers in the US, including brands like L’Oréal, PacSun and Scrub Daddy.  TikTok Shop raked in $100 million in single-day sales this Black Friday — that’s triple the number from 2023, according to the company. Over Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend alone, the shop saw a 165% increase in shoppers year-over-year, according to a statement by the company this month.  However, a US appeals court this month upheld a law that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 or face a US ban.  That ban could grind the sales platform’s progress to a halt — but creators who spoke to CNN say that they’re sticking with TikTok Shop anyway because they don’t think a ban will actually happen.  “I don’t think TikTok is going anywhere. I think they’re going to figure it out, and there’s so many people invested in TikTok,” Autade said. “It’s hard to ignore how much it means to its users.”  What makes TikTok Shop tick?  TikTok Shop provides a pipeline from discovery to purchase by letting users shop products featured in live videos, pinned on brand and influencer profiles, or tagged in content shown on their algorithm-driven For You page.  Even before the launch of its shopping feature, TikTok had already established a reputation as a place for users to find items to add to their wishlists. A study conducted in 2022 by marketing consulting firm Material Plus found that 61% of users purchased an item after seeing content about it on TikTok, helped by hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which has over 12 million posts.  Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and TikTok creator, said combining passive entertainment with a shopping function can tempt users to open their wallets.  “You’ve got all these people who are spending so much time just being (on TikTok) consuming and creating content,” she said. “When you mix in commerce with our favorite source of entertainment, then we’re going to spend all our money there.”  TikTok Shop’s reliance on user-generated content allows consumers to hear from voices they trust.  Lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk says TikTok Shop's main draw is its ability to let consumers see their favorite influencers use the products they promote in real time. Courtesy Carrie Berk  Social media strategist Keenya Kelly says that TikTok Shop is another avenue for content creators to make money on TikTok without having to leave the app. Courtesy Keenya Kelly  “If you see your favorite creator promoting a product on a live stream or a video, you’re more likely to buy it in that moment,” said Carrie Berk, a lifestyle content creator. The thinking among viewers, she said, is that “if a makeup influencer is promoting a product on TikTok Shop, if she says it’s good, then it must be good.”  TikTok users like Autade also say that the app’s focus on short-form videos gives it an edge over other social media platforms.  “When I click on a product and I can see hundreds or even thousands of people posting a video about that product authentically, that really helps,” he said. “On a different platform, I might just see some words, some reviews, some stars here and there,” but seeing the product in action is different.  Another component of TikTok Shop’s growth is its popularity with younger users. Some 62% of Gen Z consumers say that TikTok is their platform of choice when they need to look something up, beating out search engines like Google, according to a report by marketing technology company SOCi published this year.  “Gen Z as a whole has really chosen TikTok as their premier destination for content,” said Jen Jones, chief marketing officer of e-commerce platform Commercetools. “TikTok shop just seemed like a natural place for those dollars to be spent.”  What would a TikTok ban mean for other social media retail platforms?  Social media shopping is not a new phenomenon.  Ninety-two percent of retailers plan to invest more in social commerce this holiday season, according to a study by Commercetools published in October. The same study showed that Facebook Marketplace was the social commerce platform of choice for businesses, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok Shop and X.  In particular, Jones sees an opportunity for YouTube to fill in the space TikTok could leave behind if a ban comes into force.  She says that YouTube could potentially meet demand for the style of short-form videos popularized by TikTok through YouTube Shorts while capitalizing on its longer-form content.  In the past year alone, people watched over 30 billion hours of shopping-related content on YouTube, the company previously told CNN in an email. In 2023, it launched YouTube Shopping, allowing content creators to tag products from brands featured in their videos and earn commissions.  Experts say that if the TikTok ban happens, it will serve as a lesson for brands to not put all their eggs into one marketing basket.  The Shop tab of the TikTok app is seen on an iPhone on June 23 in Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images  “It’s just really important for companies to have a very diversified strategy when it comes to social shopping,” said Jones. “We know that social shopping is here to stay. You can’t get locked into just one platform.”  Kelly says the same advice applies to individual content creators who make money off their posts and videos, and recommends cultivating a following through more direct forms of outreach like email lists.  “We use social media to reach a group of people,” she said. “You need to pull those people off social media onto email so that you have control over your business.”  Still, Kelly says she sees no reason for content creators to be concerned over the court ruling that moves TikTok one step closer to a ban.  “I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, she said. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.”  Berk commands an audience of almost 4 million followers on TikTok and describes the social media platform as a big part of her livelihood, but she says she’s not worried by the prospect of a total ban next month.  “There has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical,” she said.  Autade still has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, but he told CNN that TikTok was his primary marketing avenue and the platform that has brought him the most success.  Even as the threat of a ban looms nearer, he says it’s still business as usual and plans to continue with a live event in January similar to the one he hosted on Black Friday.  “I’m still all-in on TikTok. I’m still living my day-to-day life, running my businesses, and everything’s pretty much the same until I hear otherwise,” Autade said.",US,TikTok Shop was going to be the next big thing.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked.",US,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,,,,0.021,0.948,0.031,0.2114
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/sony-stock-record/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  The last time Sony was worth this much on the stock market, Bill Clinton was president and the PlayStation 2 was about to debut on American store shelves.  It’s been a rough past two and a half decades for Sony, the 78-year-old company that invented the Walkman and the PlayStation and had long been an icon of consumer electronics. It largely missed the boat on the mobile phone revolution, and while the PlayStation has been profitable, production costs for other electronics have risen while demand has softened.  But as opportunities arise in streaming, Sony is trying to transition from being a legacy consumer electronics company to an original content and entertainment company.  The strategy is working: In the past three years, Sony’s stock (SONY) has started to break out of a decades-long slump. Sony’s stock price in Japan recently closed at the first record high since March 2000, signifying confidence in the company’s ability to evolve its game offerings and steer itself toward entertainment, Damian Thong, a research equity analyst at Macquarie, told CNN.  “If you went back 30 years ago, it was an electronics company, so best known as a seller of hardware,” Thong said. “But today, the company is primarily generating profits off of entertainment, which is games, music and (TV and movies).”  Less hardware, more content  Sony Group, Japan’s third largest company by market value, has turned itself around by innovating its games business beyond consoles and making acquisitions to expand its IP, Joost van Dreunen, an adjunct assistant professor at NYU Stern who teaches the business of video games, told CNN.  Sony acquired Anime powerhouse Crunchyroll in 2021, and it acquired American video game company Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion.  In addition to Sony Interactive Entertainment, which makes the PlayStation, the behemoth Sony Group also includes Sony Pictures, which produces films like the Spider-Man series, and Sony Music, which includes Columbia Records.  Sony is trying to unlock synergy across its subsidiary companies to produce original entertainment content for consumers, van Dreunen said.  Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal in the first season of ""The Last of Us."" Liane Hentscher/HBO  That strategy of leveraging its intellectual property across its brands became apparent at the 75th Emmy Awards in January, when the TV series “The Last of Us” won eight primetime awards. It was the first time a TV show adapted from a videogame earned major consideration at a Hollywood awards ceremony.  It was a momentous occasion for Sony, which first published “The Last of Us” as a videogame in 2013 before it was adapted to become a TV series released in 2023 on HBO and Max. (HBO and Max share ownership with CNN.)  Without a streaming network of its own, licensing its intellectual property and original content is part of Sony’s strategy to compete with streaming giants like Netflix, Disney and Amazon.  Robert Lawson, the chief communications officer for Sony Group, said in a statement that since 2018 when the company acquired EMI publishing, making Sony Music the world’s largest publisher of music, Sony has invested approximately 1.5 trillion yen into content IP across various entertainment businesses.  “Sony Group has shifted its corporate strategies towards strengthening its creation and entertainment assets,” Lawson said, noting the company is focusing on “new collaborations between Sony sister companies,” including leaning heavily into the anime genre.  In the last fiscal year ending March, Sony’s entertainment business, which includes music, movies and games, accounted for 60% of total revenue. That’s double from a decade ago, when the entertainment business accounted for just 30% of total revenue.  A long road to dominance  Doubling down on entertainment represents a departure from Sony’s origins.  Before there was Sony, there was Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, founded in 1946 by Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka. The company released Japan’s first-ever magnetic tape record in 1950. In 1958, the company changed its name to Sony Corporation.  In the 1960s, Sony established its business in the United States. For the next three decades, the Japanese company emerged as a household name in consumer electronics, producing iconic devices from the Trinitron color TV in 1968 to the Walkman cassette player in 1979 to the world’s first CD player in 1982, in addition to numerous cameras and video recorders.  Sony has also been involved with music since the 1960s through a joint venture with CBS that became Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Yet it’s largely been known for its electronics.

Aflo/Shutterstock  The 1990s were a high point for Sony as it broke into the world of gaming consoles. With the release of the PlayStation in 1994, Sony disrupted the arcade and gaming industry.  Since the 1990s, Sony has been a dominant player in the videogame console business with iterations of the PlayStation. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, which has consistently outsold its main competitors like Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Nintendo’s Switch, according to data from Ampere Analysis, an analytics firm for the games business.  Van Dreunen said that Sony is also looking to evolve in gaming beyond its console business, looking for new audiences and methods of distribution.  “We’re currently going through a softer period in gaming, and so it really raises the stakes for companies like, what’s next?” he said. “How do you as the dominant console maker continue to innovate and continue to grow your business?”  An original PlayStation is pictured at a display of various memorabilia in the lobby of the Sony headquarters building in central Tokyo on November 27, 2024. December 3 this year marked the 30th anniversary of the first release of Japan's Sony PlayStation, transforming the world of video games. Richard A. Brooks/AFP/Getty Images  A customer walks away after purchasing the new Sony Playstation PS5 in Seoul on November 12, 2020, after Sony launched the new console in select markets around the world. Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images  Thong said that Sony has been successful in becoming a profitable channel for third-party publishers to sell videogames.  Sony has tried to diversify its strategy toward gaming, including publishing a videogame called Helldivers 2 across PlayStation5 and also PC. Helldivers 2 was a hit for Sony and sold over 12 million copies within three months of its release, according to Anna Kerr, a research manager for games at Ampere Analytics.  “The games business is spreading out its IP,” NYU Stern’s van Dreunen said. “It’s looking for new ways to reach customers, to expand that customer reach.”  In November, Sony announced a 69% percent jump in net quarterly profit, driven in part by its game segment. The company has had consistently strong quarters this year, driven by profitability in its games.  The company is now in talks to acquire Kadokawa, a Japanese videogame powerhouse that produces the popular videogame “Elden Ring,” according to people familiar with the matter.  There have been some headwinds: Sony’s rollout of the “Concord” vieogame and Sony Pictures’ latest installment of the Spider-Man universe were largely flops among fans this year. However, they are trial and error runs, van Dreunen said, and manageable expenditures for a company that has denoted 1.8 trillion yen ($11 billion) for acquisitions and stock buybacks through March 2027.  In May, at Sony’s annual investor conference, Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida said that the company was embracing a “creative entertainment vision.”  Sony’s emergence as an entertainment company was not always certain, Thong said.  “Sony had some years of quite substantial pain, I would say,” Thong said. “And I think to their credit, they managed to weather and see through it.”  Bringing Sony IP to the big screen  Van Dreunen said in the past, there wasn’t as much demand for videogame adaptations for movie and TV. Yet “The Last of Us” showed that Sony had an opportunity to bring more Sony IP to the big screen.  Before “The Last of Us,” Sony also tried its hand at videogame adaptation with “Uncharted,” a 2022 movie featuring actor Tom Holland that was based on a video game franchise first published by Sony in 2007.

Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg/Getty Images  Additionally, Sony is planning to adapt videogame franchise “God of War,” which it first published in 2005, to the big screen next year, Kerr said.  Sony is still in the electronics business, Thong said, noting its image sensors business works with companies like Apple and it produces high-end cameras. However, it has shed its identity as a mass consumer electronics company.  In 2025, Sony intends to spin off its online banking and insurance units, further doubling down on its entertainment offerings.  Sony’s stock is up almost 18% in the past month, outpacing entertainment heavyweights like Disney and Netflix, and boosted from investors piling into the Nasdaq, which crossed 20,000 for the first time this week.",US,Sony hasn’t been this hot since it made the Walkman,,,,0.013,0.855,0.132,0.9996
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/business/unitedhealthcare-insurance-denials-change/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,,"CNN —  In his first public response to the consumer outcry following the fatal shooting of one of his top executives, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said Friday that the US health system “is not perfect” and that coverage decisions “are not well understood.”  “We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people’s frustrations with it,” Witty wrote in a guest essay in the New York Times. “No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It’s a patchwork built over decades.”  Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.  “Together with employers, governments and others who pay for care, we need to improve how we explain what insurance covers and how decisions are made,” Witty wrote. “Behind each decision lies a comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety.”  Witty also praised UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was killed in midtown Manhattan last week, writing that Thompson “fought for preventive health and quality health outcomes rather than simply adding ever more tests and procedures.”  In a statement on Friday, UnitedHealthcare said “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company’s treatment of insurance claims” and that it “approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission,” noting that “around one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons.”  Will changes be made?  Thompson’s fatal shooting pushed Americans’ dissatisfaction with their health insurance into the spotlight. Many have made their frustrations abundantly clear on social media.  Journalists have also chronicled insurers’ efforts to twist the system to their benefit. STAT, a news site that focuses on health care, has published a series of investigative stories on UnitedHealth, including articles on how the nation’s largest health insurer uses a computer algorithm to cut off rehabilitation care for Medicare enrollees, limiting clinical case managers’ discretion.  Whether the public outcry prompts UnitedHealthcare and other insurers to adjust their practices — particularly the much-maligned denials of treatment and claims — or pushes lawmakers to force the industry to make changes remains to be seen. It depends, in part, on whether patients continue making their voices heard, experts say.  Angry consumers have had success in overhauling the health insurance industry in the past. They railed against the restrictions of health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, in the 1990s, as captured in the 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” That helped spur insurers to offer more preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, which have fewer constraints but are more costly.  Any shifts in the nation’s complex health care system, however, will not come easily, nor quickly, experts say. There are many players involved, each of which has its own patient care concerns, financial interests and lobbying dollars to influence lawmakers.  UnitedHealthcare’s mission  While many patients and their advocates argue that insurers deny care to pad their profits, the industry maintains that it is protecting consumers from high prices and unnecessary care.  Soon after Thompson’s murder, Witty vowed in an internal message to employees to continue the insurer’s mission of helping “the system improve.”  “Our role is a critical role, and we make sure that care is safe, appropriate, and it’s delivered when people need it,” said Witty in a video message obtained by CNN. “And we guard against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex and ultimately unsustainable. So we’re going to continue to make that case.”  “What we know to be true is that the health system needs a company like UnitedHealth Group,” he continued.  Asked Thursday whether it will make any changes in response to consumers’ public complaints, UnitedHealthcare referred CNN to Witty’s video. Other major insurers either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment, but a leading industry association said that hospitals, providers and employers all have “a direct impact on the cost and accessibility of medical services.”  “In the fragmented and heavily regulated health care system, health plans, providers and drugmakers share a responsibility to make high-quality care as affordable as possible and easier to navigate for the people we collectively serve,” AHIP, the trade group, said in a statement. “Health plans are working to protect patients from the full impact of rising costs while connecting them to care that is safe, evidence-based and coordinated.”  But the recent events may prompt insurers to investigate their practices and make some changes, Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in an email to CNN. This is especially likely if they see risks to their businesses, such as if employers threaten to leave because coverage decisions are too onerous for their workers.  On the flip side, “the main reason to not change their practices is to maintain their profitability while also keeping costs reasonable in a broad sense for their clients and end users,” Utterback wrote.  Video Ad Feedback Scott Galloway says online rage directed at health care CEOs is directed at the wrong people. Hear why. 01:43 - Source: CNN  The HMO backlash  Though former President Bill Clinton failed to reform health care in the early 1990s, his administration’s efforts spurred increased concerns over the cost of care. That cued the growth of the HMO model, which allowed policyholders to see only certain doctors and required referrals from primary care physicians to see specialists and get certain tests and procedures. But HMOs also typically featured low premiums, low or no co-pays and no deductibles.  Policyholders rebelled because they felt they couldn’t access the care they needed, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.  Their angst was captured in extensive media coverage and in the 1997 film “As Good As It Gets,” when a young boy’s mother (played by Helen Hunt) tells a doctor (played by Harold Ramis) that her insurer would not cover an allergy test for her son’s asthma.  “F**king HMO, bastard pieces of sh*t,” Hunt says, before apologizing.  “That’s ok. Actually, I think that’s their technical name,” Ramis replies.  Many states responded to the complaints by passing patients’ bills of rights that limited HMO cost-control practices in state-regulated plans. Employers, who were hearing from angry workers, began shifting to PPOs, which generally provide coverage for a wider range of doctors but have much higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. PPOs have now largely eclipsed the managed care model.  But as health care costs continue to skyrocket, PPOs are instituting practices that resemble those of HMOs, particularly requiring approval of care in advance, known as prior authorization, Levitt said.  “If you think health care costs are rough now, imagine them without constraints,” said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+, a health care consulting group, and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.  Health insurers, however, do at times backtrack when faced with intense blowback. Earlier this month, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield halted its plan to limit the amount of time it would cover anesthesia used in surgeries and procedures after criticism from doctors and politicians. The policy was designed to reduce overbilling and make care more affordable, the insurer had said.  Efforts in Congress  Congress has tried for years to improve access to care and curtail costs, which are far higher in the US than in its peers even though it ranks last on key health measures. Lawmakers have held hearings and introduced bills, but there haven’t been comprehensive reforms enacted since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 — aside from several significant Medicare drug cost provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.  An effort to improve the prior authorization process in Medicare Advantage plans failed to advance in the Senate in 2022 after the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost about $16 billion over a decade.  However, there is now more bipartisan appetite on Capitol Hill to enact reforms, said Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive and vocal critic of the health care industry. Lawmakers reintroduced the prior authorization bill, which now comes with a zero cost estimate, and released a framework to establish so-called site-neutral payments in Medicare, under which Medicare would pay the same rate for a service provided in a hospital outpatient department, an ambulatory surgical center or physician’s office.  Plus, lawmakers are looking at reforms to the pharmacy benefit manager industry, which serves as a middleman between health insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers.  Republicans, who will control Congress starting in January, will be looking for cost savings to offset extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Whitlock said. That could push them to pass measures that would save the government money, such as site-neutral payments.  Meanwhile, the murder of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO will remain in the news as the case against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, winds its way through the court system. That will keep public frustration with health insurers in the spotlight – and could help advance legislation on Capitol Hill, Potter said.  “It will be a years long fight, but it’s going to happen,” he said. “Some kind of reform is inevitable.”",US,UnitedHealth Group CEO: America’s health system is poorly designed,,,,0.082,0.791,0.127,0.9982

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/us/drone-sightings-new-jersey-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"New York CNN —  Federal agencies are facing intense pressure to give the public more details on unexplained drone sightings in the New York City metropolitan area and beyond that have been going on for weeks over residential neighborhoods as well as restricted sites and critical infrastructure.  On Saturday, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey posted on X about the “growing number of drone sightings” there, making her state the latest to report such sightings, joining New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.  Federal officials have sought to calm the concerns about the sightings, but without giving further details about what they might be. They say there’s no evidence of a public safety threat, and many of the reported sightings are cases of mistaken identity.  “The bottom line is this: They’re not providing enough information to the public, and the public is concerned,” US Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Friday. “Believe me, I’m hearing from my constituents about this all the time, and I think it’s time for them to immediately get out there and brief.”  A drone sighting prompted the temporary closure of runways at New York’s Stewart International Airport on Friday night, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the Orange County airport about 70 miles north of New York City.  There were no impacts to the airport’s flight operations during the closure, which lasted about an hour, according to the Port Authority, which was alerted to the sighting by the Federal Aviation Administration.  “This has gone too far,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement Saturday, adding that last month she “directed the New York State Intelligence Center to actively investigate drone sightings and coordinate with federal law enforcement to address this issue.”  Earlier Friday, New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis called the response to the sightings “outrageous,” saying there are “drones and unmanned aerial systems flying above us and our government is not telling us who’s operating them and for what purpose?”  Malliotakis joined Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella in demanding answers.  Fossella said the drones, often seen flying at night, have been spotted hovering over critical infrastructures including Port Liberty New York near the Goethals Bridge, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and Fort Wadsworth, one of the oldest military installations in the country.  Representatives of the federal agencies investigating the drones who have briefed local officials behind closed doors said the drones sometimes appear to fly in a coordinated pattern and can sometimes be in flight for up to six hours, according to Montvale, New Jersey, Mayor Mike Ghassali.  And though federal officials have said there is no evidence the drone sightings pose a public safety threat, Belleville, New Jersey, Mayor Michael Melham has said he has received guidance police should call the county bomb squad if they encounter a downed drone.  In addition, local fire departments should wear hazmat suits when they respond, Melham said, saying the information was shared by his Office of Emergency Management following recent state-level meetings.  “We just don’t know what these things are, so we are being cautious,” Melham said.  Skepticism over government response  One New Jersey lawmaker is accusing federal officials of lying about the presence and purpose of the mysterious drones.  “They’re lying. That’s the long and the short of it,” Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson said in an interview Saturday with CNN’s Victor Blackwell.  Like several other officials and lawmakers, Peterson said he’s personally seen drones hovering near his rural New Jersey home, where he said the absence of street lights and nearby flight paths allows for clear visibility.  Peterson referenced the government’s response to the Chinese spy balloon that traversed over parts of the United States in 2023 to illustrate his point that the government is either embarrassed or unwilling to disclose the truth about the mystery drones due to security concerns.  “Why would you lie? Either because the reason that this is happening is incredibly embarrassing to the administration or it’s an incredibly high security risk for the country and they don’t want to tell us,” he said.  President-elect Donald Trump, meanwhile, has called on the Biden administration to either release any information it has about the mysterious sightings or shoot the drones out of the sky.  “Mystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government’s knowledge. I don’t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!! DJT,” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Friday his agency knows of “no threat or of any nefarious activity” related to the sightings.  Mayorkas pledged to be transparent “if we learn of any cause for concern.”  Officials are currently prioritizing the use of sophisticated radio frequency technology that can geolocate the operator of a drone, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.  There are multiple technical capabilities authorities can use to try and “defeat” a drone, including jamming a signal, disconnecting it from the operator or remotely “hijack” a drone but every option can pose numerous risks, the source said.  “Blowing it out of the sky is the last resort,” the source said, noting the option is always on the table if an aircraft presents a threat.  Federal and state officials said using offensive techniques to bring down the drones poses an unnecessary risk to people on the ground and legal challenges, especially as they have not been deemed threatening, the source said.  New Jersey’s Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has formally requested additional resources from the Biden administration to better address the ongoing situation.  “While I am sincerely grateful for your administration’s leadership in addressing this concerning issue, it has become apparent that more resources are needed to fully understand what is behind this activity,” Murphy said in a letter dated Thursday.  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.  Murphy’s concerns come as Naval Weapons Station Earle, a US Navy base south of Middletown, New Jersey, acknowledged Friday it had spotted “several instances of unidentified drones entering the airspace” above the facility despite no direct threats being identified.  “The base remains prepared to respond to any potential risks, leveraging robust security measures and advanced detection capabilities,” station spokesperson Bill Addison said in an email to CNN, adding there are airspace restrictions above the station.  The energy company PSEG on Saturday said it has “contacted the appropriate authorities” about reports of drones flying over its Salem and Hope Creek nuclear power plants in New Jersey.  Democratic Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey posted videos to his X account showing what appeared to be a cluster of drones over the Round Valley Reservoir Thursday night.  “This has gone on for weeks,” Kim wrote. “It’s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren’t able to track these devices to determine origin and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and counter measures.”  Last night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here’s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn — Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024  Morris County, about 30 miles west of New York City, issued a statement calling for “the federal government to marshal all federal resources at its disposal, including the military, to end the unauthorized flight of drones over our county and other parts of New Jersey.”  “Morris County and our communities have deployed considerable resources daily since the first drones were spotted,” the statement continued.  The Somerset County Sheriff’s Office similarly said in a Facebook post they had “increased vigilance” at sensitive locations and “are analyzing data and information on a daily basis.”  New York State Police said Friday afternoon in a post on X they had received “numerous reports of drone sightings over the past 24 hours” and they were investigating the reports. “We have no evidence at this time that any of the reported sightings pose a public safety threat,” reads the post.  Connecticut State Police announced Friday they have deployed a drone detection system to assist in investigative efforts into unauthorized drone sightings reported over Fairfield County.  “It’s very unsettling to public safety and security, both here in Fairfield and elsewhere,” Republican state Sen. Tony Hwang said in a statement Friday.  “What we have is a lack of information at all levels of government. It’s really a breakdown of communication. Without that vital communication, you lose the public’s confidence, you get speculation and you get fear,” he said.  And in Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro said his administration is “aware of” the reported drone sightings and is taking them seriously. The Democratic governor said Friday evening he directed the Pennsylvania State Police to look further into the sightings, and police will be flying helicopters to try to “determine where these drones are originating from and what the purpose of these drones are.”  White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby, in a press briefing Thursday, said there was “no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus.”  Kirby added many of “the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully.”  Mayorkas echoed Kirby’s explanation Friday, telling CNN some reported drone sightings were cases of “mistaken identity.”  Addressing calls to shoot down unidentified drones, he said, “It’s not as though anyone can just take down a drone in the sky. That in and of itself would be dangerous.”  Mayorkas added he has been in communication with New Jersey’s governor daily.  Congress briefed on drone sightings  Officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI briefed top committees in the House and Senate as well as a delegation of New Jersey lawmakers on the reported drone sightings, a source familiar with the situation tells CNN. The source said while there have been eyewitness reports of what appear to be drones over New Jersey, agency officials stressed in meetings Thursday many videos on social media appear to be civilian airplanes or helicopters.  “I don’t believe with all of these sightings, none of them are drones,” Gottheimer said, adding, “You can’t have the Wild West of drones out there,” with unmanned aircraft threatening infrastructure.  The New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness said there was “an active federal investigation” into the drone sightings, but elected officials want to hear more.  “We should be doing smart intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” US Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who sits on the Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said Thursday. “They should be shot down, if necessary, because they’re flying over sensitive areas.”  Residents in New York’s Rockland County reported drone sightings starting as early as November.  County Executive Ed Day sent a letter to President Joe Biden Friday seeking answers and urging his administration, along with the FAA and FBI, to investigate and provide clarity on the matter.  “The fact that this issue has persisted for weeks without clear answers is completely unacceptable — not just to the people of Rockland County, but to communities across the nation,” Day said in the letter. “It’s time for the Federal government to step up, take responsibility, and provide the answers we all deserve.”  Malliotakis said the situation “is creating havoc, people are confused, they’re concerned, they have anxiety, they don’t know what’s going on.”  No foreign involvement suspected by feds  The US intelligence community and federal law enforcement do not suspect foreign involvement in the drone sightings across New Jersey, security officials told members of Congress Thursday at one private briefing.  Key lawmakers assigned to congressional national security committees were told investigators do not currently believe the sightings involved an overseas connection, the use of foreign drones, nor an operator on the ground connected to a foreign government, according to a source familiar with the briefing conducted by representatives from the FBI, FAA and the Department of Homeland Security.  Officials said sighted drones have been observed with FAA-required anticollision lights and are not believed to have entered any restricted airspaces, according to the source.  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, New Jersey, on Dec. 5. Brian Glenn/TMX/AP  While authorities have not yet identified the origin of the mysterious drone flights, the source said an active FBI investigation remains underway to identify the person or persons operating them, and to determine whether any criminal violations of law have occurred.  Some of the more recent drone operations may be from copycats trying to play on people’s worries as the sightings get more news coverage, former FBI supervisory special agent Tom Adams told CNN. He said there are often innocent explanations, as well.  “I can tell you from my firsthand experience conducting operations for the FBI, as well as investigations into the suspected sighting of drones at critical infrastructure, it was fairly common for planets, crewed aircraft and even low Earth orbit satellites to be misidentified as drones at night,” Adams said.  Drones – unmanned aerial vehicles – are widely owned across the US. A total of 791,597 drones are registered with the FAA, split almost evenly between commercial drones and recreational drones.  Although the drones often display flashing lights, they frequently turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday.  The FAA issued temporary flight restrictions over the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster after drones were spotted in those areas, one week after the FAA received its first report of an unauthorized drone operation in the New York metro area on November 18.  “Until you know the origin and what these drones’ intent is, how can you tell me there’s no imminent threat?” Mayor Tony Perry of Middletown, New Jersey, told CNN Thursday.  Feds rarely coordinate drone info with locals  The sense that local officials are being left in the dark is partially a result of outdated laws keeping regulation of the skies entirely in federal hands, according to the chief executive of a company tracking unauthorized drone flights.  “The laws that regulate aircraft are not built to empower police to deal with the drones,” Axon CEO Rick Smith told CNN News Central Friday, “so if your local state fair has a drone coming towards it that police believe might be dangerous, right now there’s nothing they can do about it.”  Hochul, the Democratic New York governor, called on Congress to pass the Counter-UAS Authority Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act, which she said would give state and local authorities more power in dealing with unmanned aircraft systems and strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones.  The governor said that until these “powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden Administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  FAA regulations allow operators of recreational drones to fly up to 400 feet above the ground in airspace not controlled by FAA air traffic controllers. The FAA does grant waivers on a case-by-case basis to those wanting to operate drones in more congested airspace or at higher altitudes.  Giving local law enforcement more authority over drones is under consideration, Smith said, because traditional aircraft tracking technology is ineffective for vehicles hovering only a few hundred feet off the ground.  “The same radar and tracking system you use for a 747 just doesn’t work,” said Smith.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process with the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items which may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  FBI: San Francisco police recognized suspect  On Friday, the FBI told CNN they received a tip from the San Francisco Police Department, saying an officer with the department’s Special Victims Unit had recognized Mangione as a possible suspect on December 5 after seeing the surveillance photos of the suspect’s unmasked face.  The San Francisco Chronicle first reported on the tip Thursday.  Chronicle reporter Megan Cassidy told CNN’s John Berman her team reported “a few days ago” on the existence of a missing persons report in San Francisco for Mangione.  “Apparently, there was somebody at SFPD that was looking into the missing persons case, and after the shooting of Brian Thompson, recognized this person and called in this tip, or emailed this tip, to the FBI,” Cassidy said.  The FBI then sent the tip to New York investigators during the manhunt, the agency told CNN.  CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explained on Friday’s “AC360” how the tip ultimately made its way to the FBI in New York and the NYPD.  “This tip comes from, I think, a victim witness specialist in the San Francisco Police Department who had that missing persons case somewhere in front of them and looked at that face and says, ‘Gee, that could be the guy that is on these FBI posters all over town,’ so SFPD sends that to San Francisco FBI,” Miller said.  “San Francisco FBI says, ‘that’s a New York office case,’” he added.  Miller explained the FBI’s New York office likely sent the information to a violent crimes squad composed of a mix of FBI agents and NYPD officers.  “They look at it and they do a workup on the name, checking, you know, any indicators that guy’s been in New York, and then they send it over to NYPD,” Miller said.  By Sunday, the tip joined 200 viable leads being examined by authorities, according to Miller.  “Then Monday morning, at 9:15 in the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, another tip leads to the capture,” he said. “So you see, these leads are piling up, being tasked out and being worked, and this was in that pile coming up because it was a viable lead. It’s just that destiny took a hand quicker.”  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.",US,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,,,,0.13,0.828,0.042,-0.9995

CNN —  I’m not much of a hugger. Sure, I’ll bust out the warm fuzzies for relatives around the holidays but I’m not like, say, my best friend, who prefers her hugs to produce the bone-liquifying pressure of an industrial vise. My husband loves to tell the story of our first date, when he approached me with open arms and I maneuvered him into a firm, businesslike handshake. Touch is just not my love language! And if you’re also not a hugger, the holidays are a gauntlet of outstretched arms and sweatered bosoms and unfamiliar colognes. We’ll make it through together! I recently watched some interviews with the lead actresses of the new “Wicked” film (which is sooo so good), and each tends to clutch the other’s single beautifully taloned finger when things get deep.

The Friendship Queen Diaries  It’s like something out of a movie: Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in 1996. Now, she’s a queen in Ghana. Despite her challenging youth, Johnson made sure she and her daughter were well-traveled, and after discovering she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, she founded a travel company to organize trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Her work attracted the attention of the Dakpema, a governing body in northern Ghana. She was blown away when they asked her to accept the title of “Zosimli Naa,” or “Friendship Queen.” The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the centuries-old Dagbon Kingdom, which comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in the city of Tamale, where she now lives. “We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.  CNN  2. Fabric of rebirth  The iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is finally open to the public again after a devastating fire damaged it five years ago. As part of this rebirth, fashion designer and artist Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was asked to create new vestments, or special service garments, for the cathedral’s clergy. Vestments are an important part of a church’s identity and de Castelbajac said the theme for the new look was “noble simplicity.” The designer drew inspiration from Notre Dame’s stained glass and blonde stone, creating a look that he said speaks to tradition and innovation; old and new. The vision was “radiant with color, radiant of hope, radiant of faith,” de Castelbajac told CNN. You can see details of the vestments in the photo above, and learn more about de Castelbajac’s process in this video.  CNN  3. Music on the brain  If you’ve ever shared your life with someone with dementia or another progressive neurological disease, you know music can be magic. Toronto-based company LUCID is combining facial mapping software, artificial intelligence, and music to create a therapy for older patients dealing with health challenges like Alzheimer’s, dementia and even depression and anxiety. The treatment involves measuring how a person’s brain reacts to music and combining that with facial mapping and artificial intelligence. Using this data, the technology can create specific playlists that hopefully can alleviate stress, restlessness, confusion and emotional discomfort in dementia patients.  Natalia Botero-Acosta  4. I would swim 500 miles  This whale puts The Proclaimers to shame! A male humpback whale has completed an extraordinary record-breaking migration, swimming more than 8,000 miles from South America to Africa. The humpback was first spotted off the coast of Colombia in 2013 and seen again a few years later not far from its original location. But in 2022, the whale was unexpectedly detected in the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa. The typical migration route for humpback whales can approach 5,000 miles in a single direction, making this one’s journey close to two times that of most whales. The discovery also marks the first documentation of an adult male humpback traveling between the Pacific and Indian oceans.  Video Ad Feedback This Saudi dish transports you to the desert 02:31 - Source: CNN  5. The power of good food  Hadeel Al Motawa knows that food can be so much more than simple sustenance. She co-founded the award-winning restaurant Takya, located in the 600-year-old historic center of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. Though the food has all the artfully prepared aura of a high-class restaurant, the menu is inspired by the traditional home cooking Al Motawa grew up with, and by her travels around Saudi Arabia and abroad. After seeing the deep connection between food and culture, Al Motawa wanted to “bring that same connection back home, to create a space where people could rediscover the beauty of Saudi cuisine.” Saudi Arabia itself is a country of great geographical, and thus culinary, diversity. For example, the Eastern Province is known for its seafood, such as Muhammar, a fried fish dish made with rice and sugar that was traditionally popular among sailors. In the country’s northern region, where temperatures are cooler and may drop below freezing during winter, traditional recipes focus on grains and meat, like the popular jareesh, a lamb stew made with wheat and yogurt.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/crystal-mangum-duke-lacrosse-allegations/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"CNN —  More than 18 years after accusing three former Duke University lacrosse players of raping her, a falsified account she shared in graphic detail, Crystal Mangum has admitted she lied about the encounter.  In an interview on a web show published Wednesday, Mangum apologized to the men and said her relationship with God has made her understand why she fabricated the story. Mangum is serving time in prison on a second-degree murder conviction for killing her boyfriend.  The timeline of the North Carolina case begins in 2006, when Mangum said she was trapped inside a bathroom, sexually assaulted and raped by David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann at a team party where she was performing as an exotic dancer. The men were arrested following her allegations.  “I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn’t, and that was wrong. And I betrayed the trust of a lot of other people who believed in me,” Mangum said on Katerena DePasquale’s show, “Let’s Talk with Kat.” “I made up a story that wasn’t true because I wanted validation from people and not from God.”  David Evans, left, Collin Finnerty, center, and Reade Seligmann, right, look on during a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2007. Chuck Burton/AP/File  For more than a year, the school and the lacrosse players were thrust into a media frenzy, subjected to intense public scrutiny and damaging allegations of sexual assault that were ultimately dropped.  After Mangum’s confession, Duke told CNN on Friday it would not comment. The former players did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.  Here’s how the events unfolded.  A timeline of the events  • March 13, 2006: Mangum is hired as a dancer for a private party held by members of the Duke men’s lacrosse team. It takes place at a house on North Buchanan Boulevard in Durham. Mangum later accuses several players of raping her during the party early on March 14.  • March 28, 2006: Duke President Richard Brodhead suspends team play for the men’s lacrosse team, a move widely criticized as premature since no formal charges had been made yet. Media attention intensifies, with early reports painting a picture of privileged, White lacrosse players being accused by a Black woman. The case becomes a flashpoint for issues of race, class and privilege, according to the Washington Post.  • March 28-30, 2006: DNA tests on Mangum’s body fail to link any of the lacrosse players to the scene, according to a disciplinary order against prosecutor Mike Nifong by the North Carolina State Bar, but Nifong insists on moving forward with the case. Skepticism about the case begins to mount.  • April 18, 2006: Nifong formally charges Seligmann and Finnerty with rape, according to the disciplinary order. The charges are based largely on Mangum’s testimony, as forensic evidence was either inconclusive or absent.  • May 15, 2006: Nifong formally charges Evans with rape, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 5, 2006: Duke announces the lacrosse team is reinstated to play in the following fall, but public sentiment has already soured.  • December 28, 2006: Nifong is accused of withholding evidence and making misleading statements to the press, leading to an investigation by the state bar, according to the disciplinary order.  • April 11, 2007: Roy Cooper – then the state’s Attorney General and now its governor – announces “there is insufficient evidence to proceed on any of the charges” in a statement shared by Duke Athletics. The charges are dropped.  “We believe that these cases were the result of a tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations,” Cooper said. “Based on the significant inconsistencies between the evidence and the various accounts given by the accusing witness, we believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges.”  • June 16, 2007: Nifong loses his law license following disciplinary hearings about his handling of the case, including accusations of ethical misconduct and withholding evidence. His disbarment is finalized by the state bar in July, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 18, 2007: Duke announces that it has settled with the three lacrosse players, agreeing to pay a confidential settlement.  “It is impossible to fully describe what we, our families and team endured. As we said from day one, we are innocent,” Evans, Finnerty and Seligmann said in a statement. “But it took three hundred and ninety-four days, and the intervention of the North Carolina Attorney General, before our innocence was formally declared.”  • October 5, 2007: The three players file a civil lawsuit against the city of Durham, Nifong and other individuals, according to court documents. Durham later settles the lawsuit in part with a one-time grant of $50,000 to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.  • April 3, 2011: Mangum is charged with stabbing her boyfriend, leading to a lengthy criminal trial, and is convicted of second-degree murder in 2013.  ‘I hope they can forgive me’  Mangum has spent 11 years in prison, which she is getting through by reading the Bible and finding humor in her thoughts, she said in her interview with “Let’s Talk with Kat.”  She wishes she could help children who were sexually abused, she told DePasquale. When asked if she could describe her experience in prison in one word, she says: “Growth.”  Before becoming an exotic dancer, she studied psychology at North Carolina Central University. The transition came from her searching for “validation,” she said in the interview.  “I was looking for love and acceptance from people,” she said. “People to love me, to accept me, to pay attention to me for validation. But you can get all of that in Jesus. He loves us just the way we are. That’s what I learned in prison.  “I hurt my brothers and I hope they can forgive me and I want them to know that I love them and they didn’t deserve that and I hope they can forgive me. I hope they can heal.”  The danger of false rape allegations for actual victims  An advocate for victims of sexual assault said rare cases like this might discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and cause people to wrongly doubt them.  “False reports hurt not only the people falsely accused, they hurt every rape victim,” Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, vice president of communications for RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, told CNN. “There are already too many victims who do not report the crime for fear of not being believed. After a false report in such a high-profile case, even more survivors may be reluctant to come forward out of fear that law enforcement will not believe them.”  A study published by Violence Against Women in 2010 found that false sexual assault reports range from between 2 to 10 percent.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor.",US,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,,,,0.113,0.794,0.093,-0.9676
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/kirstin-lobato-las-vegas-verdict/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"Las Vegas AP —  A federal jury in Nevada has awarded more than $34 million to a woman who was arrested at age 18, wrongly convicted twice, and served nearly 16 years in a Nevada state prison for a 2001 killing she did not commit.  Kirstin Lobato, who is now 41 and uses the name Blaise, cried and hugged her attorneys after a judge read the trial verdict Thursday in US District Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  “It’s been an uphill battle with many, many obstacles,” she told reporters. “And I’m happy that it’s all finally finished.”  Lobato said she didn’t know if becoming a millionaire would make up for years in prison, adding that she had “no idea what the rest of my life is going to look like.”  The civil trial jury found Las Vegas police and two detectives, now retired, fabricated evidence during their investigation and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Lobato. The panel determined that Lobato should receive $34 million in compensatory damages from the department and $10,000 in punitive damages from each former detective.  The detectives, Thomas Thowsen and James LaRochelle, and their attorney, Craig Anderson, declined to comment outside court. Anderson told US District Judge Richard Boulware he planned to file additional court documents following the verdict. Anderson said Friday an appeal was “likely.”  The department previously agreed to pay damages if the jury ruled in Lobato’s favor.  Lobato was 18 when she was interviewed by police without an attorney, arrested and charged with killing Duran Bailey in Las Vegas in July 2001. Bailey, who had been homeless, was found dead near a trash bin with a slashed neck, cracked skull and missing genitals.  No physical evidence or witnesses connected Lobato to the killing, and she maintained she never met Bailey. But police maintained she confessed in jail that she had killed a man who tried to rape her during a three-day methamphetamine binge.  Lobato was 19 when she was convicted of murder in 2002. The Nevada Supreme Court threw out that verdict and Lobato’s prison sentence in 2004 because her lawyers weren’t able to cross-examine a prosecution witness who testified that Lobato made the jailhouse confession.  Lobato was tried again in 2006, convicted of manslaughter, mutilation and weapon charges, and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.  She was exonerated and freed from prison in late 2017 after the Innocence Project and attorneys in Las Vegas again took her case to the state Supreme Court. Justices said evidence showed that Lobato was in her hometown of Panaca, Nevada, some 150 miles from Las Vegas when Bailey was killed.  Last October, a state court judge in Las Vegas issued a certificate declaring Lobato innocent of Bailey’s killing.  That action was challenged by Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson in a letter asking state Attorney General Aaron Ford to investigate how and why attorneys for Lobato acquired the certificate of innocence.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/baby-garnet-cold-case-michigan/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"CNN —  It was the middle of Jenna Gerwatowski’s workday at the local flower shop in Newberry, Michigan, when she got a call from an unknown number.  The now 23-year-old doesn’t usually answer unknown calls, but says she decided to pick this one up in May 2022.  To her surprise, it was a detective from the Michigan state police.  “He was like, ‘Have you heard of the Baby Garnet case?’” Jenna told CNN.  Jenna had heard of it. In 1997, a deceased infant was found in a campground pit toilet at the Garnet Lake Campground – right where Jenna grew up. Investigators couldn’t find any leads on the identity of the baby or anyone who witnessed a person abandoning an infant, according to a news release from the Michigan attorney general’s office. The case went cold, and the “Baby Garnet” case became a known murder mystery in Jenna’s small town for decades.  “Your DNA was a match,” Jenna says the detective on the phone told her. She was related to the dead infant from 1997.  Jenna was in shock. The detective sounded sure, Jenna said, but she wondered how he had even obtained her DNA.  About six months earlier, her friend had gotten a FamilyTreeDNA test for Christmas and Jenna decided to order her own. DNA from other Baby Garnet relatives led detectives to Jenna’s FamilyTreeDNA kit, according to court documents.  Jenna Gerwatowski, left, says the case was always a big mystery in her town. She had no idea the grandmother she'd never met, Nancy Gerwatowski, right, could be behind it. Jenna Rose Gerwatowski/Mackinac County Sheriff's Office  The detective said a woman from Identifinders International, a genetic genealogy investigation firm, would call her about her DNA to help with identifying closer relatives, according to Jenna.  According to court documents, detectives reopened the cold case in 2017 and then worked with a forensics company to extract DNA from Baby Garnet’s partial femur, before sending the results to Identifinders International.  Jenna explained the situation to her mother when she got home from work.  “It was just crazy,” Jenna said. “We were both sitting there like, I don’t even know who (the mother or father) could’ve been. We were both so confused and we’re like, it’s got to be somebody that we don’t know, you know, like a distant cousin or something.”  Jenna said her mother, Kara Gerwatowski, started to wonder whether the detective call was a scam.  Jenna’s grandfather had just been scammed by someone claiming to be a detective, so Kara told Jenna to be cautious about giving out personal information or passwords.  Misty Gillis, then a senior forensic genealogist and cold case liaison from Identifinders International, called Jenna that night, according to Jenna and court documents filed later in the case.  Jenna claims Gillis requested her FamilyTreeDNA password to be able to upload her DNA into a separate database. Jenna was concerned it was a scammer and refused to cooperate, according to court documents.  “I hung up the phone on her, not even thinking twice about it. And we went about our day. I was like, how weird. What a weird thing to scam people about,” Jenna said. “I wholeheartedly did not think that it was real.”  One week later, Jenna was working at the flower shop when she got a distressed call from her mother.  “She was like, ‘I really need you to come home. … It’s an emergency. Like, just please come as soon as you can,’” Jenna said.  Jenna rushed home thinking someone died. Her cousin was sitting with her mom at their round wooden kitchen table. Police had contacted her cousin, who works as a victim’s advocate in the county prosecutor’s office, to explain the Baby Garnet situation to Jenna. It turned out it wasn’t a scam.  “My mom had tears in her eyes,” she said. Jenna’s cousin had “just pure shock on her face. … You could hear a pin drop in there.”  Even though Jenna knew she had nothing to do with the Baby Garnet case, she was terrified police would think she was trying to hide something because of her refusal to speak with Gillis. She immediately called her.  An analysis of Jenna’s DNA kit showed she was the half-niece to Baby Garnet, according to court records.  On June 1, 2022, detectives spoke with her mother, Kara, who agreed to provide her DNA. Kara was the half-sister of Baby Garnet, according to court records.  “I feel like that is when, like, all of the puzzle pieces kind of started falling together for her,” Jenna said. “And she told detectives that, if it’s going to be anybody, it would be (her) mother.”  Kara, now 42, had not spoken with her mother, Nancy Gerwatowski, since she was 18 because they had a bad relationship, and Jenna had never met her grandmother. Regardless, both were shocked Nancy, who was living in Wyoming when police questioned her, would be the one behind their town mystery.  “I had grown up knowing about the case my whole life and then come to find out it was my grandma that did it?” Jenna said.  The Michigan attorney general’s office alleges Nancy “delivered the newborn alone at her Newberry home, during which Baby Garnet died due to asphyxiation, and that this death could have been prevented by medical intervention (Nancy) Gerwatowski did not seek.”  However, in a court filing, Nancy’s defense argues she unexpectedly gave birth while in the bathtub and the fetus “became trapped inside her birth canal.” She “attempted to pull the fetus out of her own body,” the filing says, but couldn’t deliver the fetus and lost consciousness “at some point in the delivery.” When she was finally able to deliver the fetus, it was dead, the filing says.  Her defense argues that Nancy, like the average person in the county in 1997, did not have access to a telephone or cell line, so she couldn’t call 911. While she concedes in her legal filings she placed the stillborn fetus in a bag and left the remains at the campground, her defense attorneys argue she had been in shock after having had no pain medication during the traumatic birth.  Nancy is charged with one count each of open murder, involuntary manslaughter, and concealing the death of an individual. Open murder carries a potential life sentence.  In a hearing on Thursday, Nancy’s defense argued that the case against her should be dropped in its entirety because the state cannot prove the baby was born alive. If the court allows the case to proceed, the defense argued, Nancy’s statements during police interrogation should be excluded because she was denied her right to counsel — a contention the state disputed. If the court does allow her statements to be a part of the trial, Nancy’s lawyers want her comments about considering an abortion and not seeking out prenatal care to be excluded, while the state argued the comments are relevant to possible motive.  Judge Brian D. Rahilly said he hopes to reach a decision on whether or not to drop the charges by next week or around the end of the year at the latest.  “It was a very hard time … very traumatizing and very nerve-wracking,” said Jenna. “I’ve never met this woman, so it was hard for me to even grasp that concept, but even harder for my mom because that was her mother.”",US,Baby Garnet cold case update: A DNA test helped solve a 1997 Michigan murder,,,,0.144,0.794,0.061,-0.9991
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-thursday-hnk/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"CNN —  Marked shell casings from the assassination scene match the gun found on the suspect. His fingerprints match some key items investigators found nearby. And he was arrested this week – after going silent from his mom and friends for months – with a fake ID and a handwritten “claim of responsibility” referencing the crime site.  These details and others, shared by law enforcement and people who know suspect Luigi Mangione, have been mounting since last week’s daylight killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a busy sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of the investigation into Thompson’s killing, sources tell CNN.  A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN at least two of the warrants include the backpack found in Central Park and the burner phone found along the getaway route police believe Mangione took from the shooting scene. Investigators also searched the hostel where suspected killer Mangione stayed the night before the shooting and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  After a five-day, multi-state manhunt that leaned heavily on surveillance images and pleas for the public’s help, Mangione, 26, is now charged in the case with murder after a tip led to his arrest Monday at a McDonald’s nearly 200 miles from where the brazen homicide unfolded.  Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury in the case against Mangione, sources told ABC News.  Mangione was charged in a felony arrest warrant earlier this week. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  Blair County Judge David Consiglio scheduled a hearing in Pennsylvania on December 30 in response to Mangione’s petitions for writ of habeas corpus and imposition of bail, court documents from Thursday show.  Mangione was denied bail on Tuesday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania. The habeas corpus petition is a key factor in whether the suspect can be extradited to New York.  Mangione’s team was given two weeks from Tuesday to file the habeas corpus petition, which challenges Pennsylvania’s ability to prove that Mangione is the person the state of New York has issued the arrest warrant for, according to Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.  Mangione is also set to appear in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, court on December 23 for a preliminary hearing related to state charges.  Mangione’s lawyer has denied his client’s involvement in the December 4 killing and anticipates he will plead not guilty to the murder and other charges in New York, as well as to charges related to the 3D-printed gun and fake ID in Pennsylvania, where he was caught and is being held without bond.  Defense attorney Thomas Dickey on Wednesday also dismissed the ballistics and fingerprint evidence revealed publicly hours earlier, saying he wants to examine it himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”  Thomas Dickey, attorney for suspected shooter Luigi Mangione, speaks Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “As lawyers, we need to see it. We need to see: How did they collect it? How much of it? And then we would have our experts … take a look at that, and then we would challenge its admissibility and challenge the accuracy of those results.”  Still, New York’s governor expects a murder indictment “to be issued any day now, and the second that happens, I’m issuing a warrant for extradition.”  “It feels like the evidence is very compelling,” Gov. Kathy Hochul told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. “I trust the DA here in Manhattan to make sure that he puts forth an indictment that is going to be iron-clad.”  Meanwhile, Hochul is unimpressed by the folk hero status Mangione has attained on social media as the killing of Thompson – a husband and father of two – has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry.  Mangione appears to have been driven by anger against the industry and “corporate greed” as a whole, states a New York Police Department intelligence report that also warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  “That horrific attack occurred on our streets,” Hochul said Thursday. “And the people of our city deserve to have that sense of calm that this perpetrator has been caught, and he will be never seeing the late of day again if there is justice.”  “You cannot assassinate an individual on the streets of New York – not now, not ever.”  Neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said on Thursday.  Suspect hadn’t spoken to mother since July  Until he was found Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Mangione had gone quiet from at least a few people who appear to have been close with him. The scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, he had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  Mangione’s mother had reported him missing November 18 – two weeks before Thompson’s killing – a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. She called police in San Francisco, where she knew her son had been living, and told authorities she’d called his phone repeatedly to find the voicemail full and not taking any more messages.  Mangione’s mom had no reason to believe her son was a danger to himself or others, she told the San Francisco Police Department, but she hadn’t actually spoken with him since July 1, the official said. He had worked remotely at TrueCar, she also said, where the phone was disconnected and the offices closed, the official added.  It also doesn’t appear Mangione had posted anything since midsummer to social media, where posts addressed to his X account suggest some of his friends have been trying to get in touch with him.  In July, a user tweeted at Mangione, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding. In late November, just weeks before the shooting, another user posted at Mangione, “thinking of you and prayers everyday in your name. Know you are missed and loved.”  As Mangione entered a Pennsylvania courthouse this week, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, he yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Suspected shooter Luigi Mangione is led from the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “He’s irritated, agitated about what’s happening to him and what he’s being accused of,” Dickey told CNN of Mangione’s outburst and struggle with police.  “He never had any legal representation until he walked into that building yesterday. And I talked to him … look at the difference between when he went in and when he came out … now he has a spokesperson and someone that’s going to fight for him.”  Suspect linked to fingerprints and gun  Police in New York on Wednesday publicly revealed the first positive forensic match and direct physical evidence tying Mangione to Thompson’s killing, law enforcement officials told CNN.  “We got the gun in question back from Pennsylvania. It’s now at the NYPD crime lab,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “We were able to match that gun to the three shell casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of the homicide.”  A 3D-printed gun was in Mangione’s possession when he was arrested Monday, police have said.  The three 9 mm shell casings had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, one word per bullet, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Police have been looking into whether those words, which match the title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry, may point to a motive in the killing.  Authorities also had been probing DNA material and a partial fingerprint from a discarded Starbucks water bottle and an energy bar wrapper surveillance images showed the suspect buying about 30 minutes before the shooting. Mangione’s fingerprints were confirmed as a match, Tisch said  Along with the prints and ballistics, investigators have been examining writings police have said Mangione had upon arrest, including a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility.” It did not include specific threats but indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday.  In some writings, he referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny added. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  Investigators also are looking at the suspect’s writing in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.  It included to-do lists to facilitate a killing, as well as notes justifying those plans, the source said. In one notebook passage, Mangione wrote about the late Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber who justified a deadly bombing campaign as an effort to protect against the onslaught of technology and exploitation. Mangione had written about the Unabomber in online posts as well.  In a notebook passage, Mangione concludes using a bomb against his intended victim “could kill innocents” and shooting would be more targeted, musing what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.

The statement did not indicate where Kobayashi was or how the family determined she was safe.  The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement they are “happy to learn that Hannah has been found safe” and due to the new information “this has become a private matter and we will wrap up our investigation.”  The family had launched a GoFundMe that raised over $47,000 to help find Hannah. Donations have been turned off, and donors who would like a refund can submit a claim, the family said.  Hannah Kobayashi arrived at Los Angeles International Airport from Maui on November 8, but did not board her connecting flight to New York, her sister previously told CNN.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/louisville-police-reform-breonna-taylor/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"Louisville, Kentucky AP —  The US Justice Department and the city of Louisville have reached an agreement to reform the city’s police force after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, officials said Thursday.  The consent decree, which must be approved by a judge, follows a federal investigation that found Louisville police have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the “historic content decree” will build upon and accelerate, this transformational police reform we have already begun in Louisville.” He noted that “significant improvements” have already been implemented since Taylor’s death in March 2020. That includes a city law banning the use of “no-knock” warrants.  The Justice Department report released in March 2023 said the Louisville police department “discriminates against Black people in its enforcement activities,” uses excessive force and conducts searches based on invalid warrants. It also said the department violates the rights of people engaged in protests.  “This conduct harmed community members and undermined public trust in law enforcement that is essential for public safety,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This consent decree marks a new day for Louisville.”  Once the consent decree is agreed upon, a federal officer will monitor the progress made by the city.  The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened 12 civil rights investigations into law enforcement agencies, but this is the first that has reached a consent decree. The Justice Department and the city of Springfield, Massachusetts announced an agreement in 2022 but the investigation into that police department was opened under President Donald Trump’s first administration.  City officials in Memphis have taken a different approach, pushing against the need for a Justice Department consent decree to enact reforms in light of a federal investigation launched after Tyre Nichols’ killing that found Memphis officers routinely use unwarranted force and disproportionately target Black people. Memphis officials have not ruled eventually agreeing to a consent decree, but have said the city can make changes more effectively without committing to a binding pact.  It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department’s priorities around civil rights.",US,"DOJ, Louisville reach deal after probe prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor",,,,0.054,0.79,0.156,0.9902
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"CNN —  Weeks of mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey are prompting heightened security concerns – and mounting frustrations – from residents, military personnel and federal, state and local officials.  While the state’s governor says there’s no threat to public safety, other state officials and local mayors are alarmed.  “I’m legitimately concerned for what the hell is going on because nobody knows,” state Assemblyman Brian Bergen told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey after a briefing at state police headquarters on Wednesday.  “We are literally being invaded by drones. We have no idea who is doing it and where they’re coming from,” Pequannock Mayor Ryan Herb told the station after the briefing.  Law enforcement has not identified the origin or landing sites of the drones, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday. He added that the drones primarily operate at night, often displaying flashing lights, but they turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached.  According to Melham, the drones have eluded radar detection, possibly because they do not emit frequencies or possess evasion capabilities.  He also raised alarm over where some of the drones have been spotted.  “One of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey’s critical infrastructure,” Melham said.  The mayor of West Milford, Michele Dale, reported 60 drones hovering over local reservoirs.  Some members of Congress have speculated that a foreign entity may be involved in the drones, something the Pentagon rebuffed Wednesday.  The denial came hours after US Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, told Fox News the drones were from “a mothership” from Iran that is “off the East Coast of the United States of America.”  “There is not any truth to that,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.”  Meanwhile, US Northern Command, which oversees the Defense Department’s homeland security efforts, said in statement Wednesday that it had “conducted a deliberate analysis of the events” regarding the drone sightings but had not been asked “to assist with these events.”  A spokesperson for the US Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged an encounter by one of its assets with the drones.  “Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  The aircraft were not seen as an immediate threat and did not interfere with operations, Pinneo added.  CNN reached out to the Coast Guard but did not receive an immediate response.  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told WBGO on Wednesday the public should feel secure while acknowledging their fears.  “Based on everything we know, there is no public safety risks we’re aware of,” Murphy said.  “Is it frustrating to have no answers? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes,” the governor told the radio station.  The sightings began November 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. At times, large drones — some up to 6 feet in diameter — were seen nightly in New Jersey from dusk until 11 p.m., with sightings ranging from 4 to 180, according to state lawmakers who attended the briefing Wednesday.  The drones operate in a coordinated manner, turning off their lights to evade detection, complicating tracking efforts. They are not identified as hobbyist drones or linked to the Department of Homeland Security, State Assembly member Dawn Fantasia said on X.  The FBI is leading the investigation with the New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, while the US Coast Guard is assessing jurisdictional responses.  Federal agencies have ruled out any connections of local, state, or federal governments to the sightings.  Melham called for a temporary flight ban on all personnel and commercial drones in his video update, despite official advisories against such measures.  Concerns escalated after drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to military officials and state lawmakers. The sightings prompted the FAA to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.  Unnerved residents have described frequently seeing the drones hovering overhead, sometimes traveling in clusters.  While visiting family in New Jersey, travel content creator Katie Caf initially doubted reports of drones until she spotted several moving in a “zigzagging” pattern on Saturday. The 29-year-old noticed five potential drones, which she described as being the size of a bicycle. “They’re so weird looking and they’re much bigger than normal drones. I get why everyone is freaking out now … I think it’s kinda spooky.”  Fantasia said on X that the briefing occurred Wednesday at the New Jersey State Police headquarters and included descriptions of the aircraft’s movements and federal agencies’ response.  Though Murphy has said there is no known threat to the public, Fantasia and other local leaders have expressed doubt and are demanding more transparency into the investigation.  US Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, pushed for more information from federal investigators in a letter sent Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  “I recognize the need to maintain operational security of ongoing investigations and that this situation requires complex interagency coordination,” Booker wrote. “However, there is a growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state – from constituents and local officials alike – despite assurances that the drones pose no known threats to public safety.”  The FBI in Newark has asked the public to report any information related to the drones, including in several areas along the Raritan River.  “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI field office in Newark said December 3.  During a US Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday, Robert Wheeler, assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, called the phenomenon “concerning” but said “there is nothing that is known” that would lead him to identify a public safety risk.  CNN has sought more information from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and New Jersey State Police.  This story has been updated with additional information.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/university-of-mississippi-student-killing-mistrial/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"AP —  A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the case of Sheldon “Timothy” Herrington Jr. in the 2022 killing of Jimmie “Jay” Lee, a gay man who was prominent in the LGBTQ+ community at the University of Mississippi.  Jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict after over nine and a half hours of deliberation.  Lee’s body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead.  Herrington, 24, showed little emotion as he left the courtroom with his attorneys and several relatives. He remains free on bond and is still charged with capital murder, which Mississippi law defines as a killing committed along with another felony — in this case, kidnapping. Prosecutors had said they would not seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison if he is tried again and convicted.  Jurors on Wednesday were told they could also consider lesser charges of first-degree murder, punishable by life in prison; second-degree murder, 20 years to life; or manslaughter, up to 20 years.  University of Mississippi student Jimmie ""Jay"" Lee is seen in this undated image. Oxford Police Police Department  Circuit Judge Kelly Luther said he will consult with prosecutors and defense attorneys about setting another trial.  Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee, 20, was pursuing a master’s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.  Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, where the university is located and the trial was held.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee vanished. Investigators testified that they used warrants to obtain electronic records including explicit messages between social media accounts belonging to the two men and online searches conducted by Herrington, including one inquiring how long it takes to strangle someone.  Prosecutors said during closing arguments Wednesday that Herrington and Lee had a sexual encounter that ended badly and Lee left Herrington’s apartment. They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex. Prosecutors said Lee was killed after going back.  “Tim Herrington lived a lie — lived a lie to his family,” District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. “He lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.”  Herrington’s attorney, Kevin Horan, has said prosecutors cannot prove Lee is dead without having a body. He told jurors Wednesday that text messages showed Herrington did not lure Lee to his apartment.  Judge Kelly Luther presides over the case of Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr. at the Lafayette County Courthouse in Oxford, Mississippi, on Wednesday. Bruce Newman/Pool/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal/AP  “He’s the one that’s being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,” Horan said of Lee.  Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.  Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained explicit messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.  Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched “how long does it take to strangle someone” at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.  The final text message from Lee’s phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington’s apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee’s phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee’s car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.  On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.  Herrington’s relatives sat behind him in the courtroom, and Lee’s sat behind prosecutors. When Luther dismissed court after the mistrial, he instructed the two groups to leave separately.  Jurors were chosen from another county about 250 miles to the south. They heard eight days of arguments and testimony.  The judge twice urged jurors to continue deliberating when they said they were deadlocked. After the third such message, Luther declared the mistrial and thanked them for serving, adding: “I’ve asked a lot of you.”",US,Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee: Judge declares mistrial after jury deadlocks over killing of gay University of Mississippi student,,,,0.136,0.808,0.056,-0.9977
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/us/timeline-luigi-magione-ceo-shooting/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"CNN —  As investigators work to piece together the possible motive and movements of 26-year-old Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione, suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, here’s what we know.  This timeline is based on information from law enforcement sources, official police releases, surveillance images and social media records.  Summer of 2024  Mangione had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  During the summer, Mangione appears to stop posting online, prompting worried messages from some of his friends.  In July, one user posts on X, tagging Mangione, saying, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding.  Mid-November  Mangione’s mother reports her son missing in San Francisco, law enforcement officials said.  Sunday, November 24  10:11 p.m. – Mangione arrives in New York at the Port Authority bus terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue via a bus that originated in Atlanta, then gets into a cab that takes him to the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, where he stays about half an hour.  There was an interaction while the suspect was checking in at the hostel, making casual conversation. ""At some point, he pulled his mask down and smiled at the at the clerk,"" said Joseph Kenny, NYPD chief of detectives. NYPD  11 p.m. – He takes another cab to a hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave. on the Upper West Side, identified as HI New York City Hostel in charging documents.  11:20 p.m. - Surveillance footage from the hostel shows him checking in and showing a driver’s license, according to the arrest warrant in the case. Records from the hostel show he provided a New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario on it, the warrant says.  Friday, November 29  Mangione checks out of the hostel.  “It’s not your traditional check in, check out. It’s the kind of thing where if you don’t show up at a certain time, they automatically just check you out,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. “We don’t believe that he went someplace else. It’s more of an administrative checkout.”  Saturday, November 30  Mangione checks back into the hostel.  Wednesday, December 4  5:34 a.m. – Surveillance footage reviewed by law enforcement shows Mangione leaving the hostel, possibly by bike.  5:41 a.m. – He is seen wandering around the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown, on Sixth Avenue between West 53rd and 54th Streets, and goes back and forth for a bit before heading toward a Starbucks.  “We have him wandering around, walking in the vicinity of hotel, walking on 54th Street, walking back and forth,” Kenny said.  Around 6:17 a.m. – Images from Starbucks show him buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, according to a law enforcement official.  Image of the suspect at a Starbucks on Sixth Avenue. NYPD  6:19 a.m. – Surveillance video near a deli on West 55th Street appears to show him walking and briefly stopping by a pile of trash.  Gideon Platt, Stage Star Deli  6:30 a.m. – Around 6:30 a.m., surveillance video captures what appears to be the gunman on the phone.  Patrick Laborde  6:44 a.m. – Thompson, the victim, walks toward the Hilton after leaving his hotel across the street, police said.  The masked gunman is “lying in wait” outside the hotel as Thompson makes his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.  The gunman comes up behind Thompson and shoots him in the back, Kenny said. He then walks toward Thompson and continues to shoot, stopping to clear a gun jam before firing again.  Obtained by CNN  Investigators told CNN that after the shooting, the assailant crosses the street from the Hilton, flees northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street, and gets on an electric bike on 55th Street before heading north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.  Obtained by CNN  6:48 a.m. – Mangione is seen riding an electric bike into Central Park at 60th Street, according to Kenny.  NYPD  6:56 a.m. – He rides out of the park.  6:58 a.m. - He is seen on the bike at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue.  7:00 a.m. - He is no longer on the bike and is heading northbound on 86th Street.  7:04 a.m. - Mangione gets into a cab.  7:30 a.m. – He is seen near the George Washington Bridge and a Port Authority bus station off 178th Street.  Video shows the suspect entering the bus station.  “We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” Kenny said.  5-Day Manhunt  The suspect was in Pennsylvania for “several days” after the shooting in Manhattan, according to Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police.  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the suspect traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in Altoona, where he is arrested.  Monday, December 9  In a new post on social media, Pennsylvania State Police shared new images of Luigi Mangione sitting inside the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was captured on Monday. The images show Mangione eating what appears to be a hash brown inside the establishment. Pennsylvania State Police  9:14 a.m. - Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania are dispatched to a McDonald’s restaurant, after an employee tipped off police about someone resembling photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police.  9:58 a.m. - Mangione is taken into custody at the McDonald’s, where he presented police with a forged New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario as his identification – the same ID he presented at the hostel, according to the arrest warrant.  Mangione was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea in his first court appearance in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, later that day.  Mangione has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a firearm, according to charging documents released by New York prosecutors.",US,Timeline: Before and after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s killing,,,,0.063,0.905,0.031,-0.9823
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/us/wisconsin-kayaker-fake-death-in-custody/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"Green Lake, Wisconsin AP —  A Wisconsin man who faked his own drowning and left his wife and three children to go to Eastern Europe is in police custody, online records show.  Ryan Borgwardt, 45, was booked into the Green Lake County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system, a service that provides information to crime victims such as a person’s jail custody status. No charges were listed.  The Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday in a social media post that a news conference would be held Wednesday morning to update the Borgwardt case. The post said no further information would be provided until then.  A person answering the phone at the sheriff’s office Tuesday night declined to confirm whether Borgwardt was in custody. County jail officials didn’t immediately return a phone message Tuesday night.  Last month, Sheriff Mark Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on November 11 after disappearing for three months but that he hadn’t committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were “pulling at his heartstrings” to come home. He suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance.  Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of “personal matters,” the sheriff said. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it’s the deepest in Wisconsin.  After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane.  The sheriff said at the time that investigators were working to verify Borgwardt’s description of what happened.  The sheriff’s office has said the search for Borgwardt’s body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn’t expect the search to last more than two weeks.",US,"Ryan Borgwardt: Wisconsin kayaker who faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe is in custody, online records show",,,,0.06,0.933,0.007,-0.9398

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-administration-big-donors/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"CNN —  Nearly three dozen of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks to serve in his incoming administration donated to his campaign or to the deep-pocketed outside groups that worked to elect him, a CNN analysis of federal campaign records shows.  They range from tech multibillionaire Elon Musk – who has emerged as the single largest, disclosed political donor of the 2024 presidential election – to others close to Trump tapped for key roles throughout government.  In all, eight of his Cabinet picks – led by Linda McMahon, the billionaire wrestling magnate Trump has selected to oversee the Education Department – and their spouses donated more than $37 million combined from their personal accounts to aid Trump, the review found, underscoring the proliferation of ultra-rich Americans now poised to shape US policy in the incoming second Trump administration.  (Two other Cabinet choices, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, transferred money from their campaign accounts to the pro-Trump effort.)  Musk has not been selected for a formal Cabinet job but is helping guide a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative and has played a pivotal role in the presidential transition – offering his views on job candidates, talking to world leaders and meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as he weighs how to downsize the federal government.  In all, the SpaceX and Tesla chief executive donated more than $277 million to federal elections this cycle, the lion’s share of which – more than $262 million – benefited Trump. Most of Musk’s pro-Trump dollars flowed to a super PAC that the world’s richest man created to help turn out voters on the Republican’s behalf in key swing states.  Outside of self-funded presidential candidates, no individual has donated more to shape federal contests in a single election cycle, said Brendan Glavin, research director of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes money in politics.  Trump’s donors “are not just getting these sort of plum ambassadorships on the side,” Glavin said. “Major donors are getting positions that affect policy.”  The CNN analysis researched the more than 90 people that Trump had announced for high-level positions in the administration through Tuesday, which marked five weeks since his election victory. More than 30 of them had donated to his campaign or to one of the leading Trump-aligned outside groups, the review of FEC records found.  “Millions of Americans fed up with failure in the White House and federal government joined President Trump in the movement to restore our nation’s greatness. Some who will work with President Trump are among those millions of people who supported the campaign and helped the President win a decisive electoral victory,” Brian Hughes, a Trump transition team spokesman, said in a statement in response to CNN’s inquiry about donors joining the administration.  The total donations from Trump’s current Cabinet picks marks a surge from Trump’s first term. Five members of his original Cabinet had donated nearly $8 million to his committees or to the major outside groups supporting him, a review of campaign reports shows.  Donations from McMahon, who served as Trump’s SBA administrator in his first White House term, accounted for more than 90% of that total in the 2016 election.  The sums spent to aid Trump in 2024 far exceed the donations that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet members contributed to help him win the White House in 2020, FEC records show.  A dozen members of Biden’s Cabinet reported donations to his campaign or major super PACs involved in the 2020 election, giving less than $100,000 in total.  Billionaires in the administration  Musk’s spending dwarfed that of other supporters.  McMahon was the largest donor among Trump’s Cabinet picks and the second most generous contributor, after Musk, among the administration members announced through Tuesday, the review found.  Most of the $21.2 million she donated went to Make American Great Again, Inc., the main Trump-affiliated super PAC that spent heavily on advertising to aid his campaign.  Other seven-figure donors among Trump’s Cabinet picks include Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick, whom Trump has tapped to serve as Commerce secretary; Scott Bessent, the hedge fund executive Trump has selected to oversee the Treasury Department; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, his choice to head the Small Business Administration.  Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher, also was a major donor, contributing more than $2 million to the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and Trump’s joint fundraising committee.  Sprecher is the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and was at Trump’s side when the president-elect rang the opening bell at the exchange Thursday.  In an email, Loeffler’s communication director Caitlin O’Dea said, “Senator Loeffler is proud to be one of President Trump’s strongest supporters for the same reason a historic landslide of Americans voted to put him back in the White House: he will restore American prosperity, security, and opportunity.”  The billionaire embrace marks a turnaround of sorts for Trump, who saw corporate America recoil from him after the violent January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And he has seen new support from tech leaders who are pushing for fewer regulations from the federal government.  The staggering sums spent by Musk in this year’s election helped Trump close the financial advantage of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who swiftly raised $1 billion after becoming her party’s standard-bearer in late July.  Super PACs face no limit on the size of donations they can receive or spend, but technically are not allowed coordinate their advertising decisions with the candidates they support.  However, a ruling this year by the FEC granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing efforts freed up Musk to guide a ground game for Trump.  “The campaign finance system is a joke,” said Fred Wertheimer, who heads the Democracy 21 watchdog group and is a longtime advocate for limits on money in politics. “Musk is the example now of how campaign finance laws have failed.”  He said he worries about government departments led by billionaires who have no “interest in doing the job that the agency was assigned.”  Musk did not respond to inquiries from CNN.  But Tom Davis, a former congressman from Virginia who chaired the House Republicans’ campaign arm for several years, argues “there is nothing inherently wrong about people who made a lot of money wanting to give back through government.”  “The fact that they have contributed shows a degree of loyalty,” he added.  Friends and family  Presidents often reward donors and allies with plum positions – often dispatching them to glamorous, low-conflict posts in Europe or the Caribbean.  Some of Trump’s early picks for ambassadorships follow that pattern and include billionaires who donated to his reelection effort. Among them: Arkansas investor Warren Stephens, named as the US’ envoy to the UK, and Charles Kushner, Trump’s choice for ambassador to France – one of several extended family members or close friends who has been chosen for diplomatic gigs.  Kushner, who donated $2 million to pro-Trump efforts and received a presidential pardon at the end of Trump’s first term, is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. Another donor, Tom Barrack, who oversaw the fundraising for Trump’s first inauguration, is his choice as ambassador to Turkey.  And incoming special envoy to the Middle East, real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff, is a longtime Trump friend and a partner in the cryptocurrency businesses that Trump launched with his sons earlier this year.  He donated $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC.",US,Big donors secure big roles in the incoming Trump administration,,,,0.022,0.846,0.133,0.9994

Nancy Mace in March that a jury found Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll.  Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and that he defamed her when he denied her claim. Trump has denied all wrongdoing toward Carroll.  In 2023, a jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, though it did not find that Carroll proved he raped her. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million for batter and defamation. In January, Carroll was awarded an additional $83.3 million in damages for his defamatory statements disparaging her and denying her rape allegations.  The jury did not find that Carroll proved Trump had raped her. Instead, a judge concluded months later when dismissing Trump’s countersuit against Carroll that the claim Trump raped Carroll was “substantially true.” The judge wrote in August 2023 that Trump “raped” her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.  In the lawsuit filed against ABC News in March, Trump claimed that Stephanopoulos’ statements were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.”  The case was allowed to move forward in July, with the judge refusing to dismiss the lawsuit, writing that these definitions were different enough. He added that the case would turn on “whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury’s verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.”  This story is breaking and will be updated.",US,ABC News settles defamation suit with Trump for $15 million,,,,0.156,0.804,0.04,-0.9932
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/antony-blinken-jordan-syria/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"Aqaba, Jordan CNN —  The United States has had direct contact with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Syrian rebel group now in de-facto control of the country, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday.  The first public confirmation of direct interaction with the US-designated terrorist group, known as HTS, came at the conclusion of Blinken’s diplomatic sprint through the region spurred by the sudden collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  “Yes, we’ve been in contact with HTS and the other parties,” Blinken said at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan. Blinken did not give details on when the contact was made or at what level. There is no legal barrier to speaking with a designated terrorist group.  “We have pressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,” Blinken said, referencing the American journalist who was detained in Syria more than a decade ago. The US has redoubled its efforts to find him in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse.  The US also shared the principles expected of a new Syrian government, including that the rights of all Syrians should be respected, that the country must not become a base for terrorism, that humanitarian aid must be delivered, and that chemical weapons stockpiles should be secured and safely destroyed.  Those principles, circulated by the US in the days after Assad’s shocking ouster, were further agreed upon in a joint statement by the US and a coalition of other countries at an urgent ministerial meeting in Aqaba on Saturday. Blinken said the agreement “sends a unified message to the new interim authority and parties in Syria.”  Ahead of the Saturday ministerial meeting, Blinken met with key partners in Jordan, Turkey and Iraq to garner consensus around the principles.  “America and our partners have an important stake in helping the Syrian people chart this new path,” the top US diplomat said Saturday. “We know what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders — from mass displacement to terrorism.”  “We can’t underestimate the challenges of this moment and the weeks and months ahead,” he added.  Throughout his trip, Blinken sought to emphasize those stakes. Moving forward, the dynamics on the ground in the region could present significant complications, despite a consensus on the principles.  There was an intense spate of fighting in recent weeks in northern Syria between Turkish-backed forces and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which the US sees as a key partner in the fight to keep ISIS degraded.  A fragile truce between the two sides in Manbij appears to be holding, but the fighting forced the SDF to halt its anti-ISIS operations, according to its top commander.  “This is a moment of vulnerability in which ISIS will seek to regroup, taking the advantage of transition in Syria,” Blinken said Saturday, reemphasizing the importance of the SDF.  In meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Ankara, Blinken warned the US does not want to see any party take actions that would allow ISIS to regroup, including by distracting the SDF from its mission to keep the terrorist group degraded and its fighters imprisoned, a US official said. Blinken also emphasized that nobody should take actions that could jeopardize factions in Syria from potentially coming together in a unified government.  In Baghdad, Blinken asked Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to crack down on the powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and to prevent Iran from transiting weapons through Iraq to Shia militias in Syria, the US official said. Such militias have targeted US personnel and interests in the past.  The response to Israel’s actions in Syria has also emerged as point of division between the US and its Arab partners.  Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has pummeled Syria with strikes and sent Israeli troops to — and beyond — a “buffer zone” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria, in what the United Nations said would be a violation of a 1974 agreement. Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Qatar have condemned Israel’s seizure of the buffer zone, calling it an attempted land grab.  The US, however, has not condemned the move, with Blinken saying that they are talking with the Israeli government.  “The stated purpose of those actions from the Israelis is to try to make sure that equipment that’s been abandoned — military equipment that’s been abandoned by the Syrian army — doesn’t fall into the wrong hands: terrorists, extremists, etc.,” he said Thursday. “But … we’re already talking with Israel; we’re all talking to others about the way ahead.”  A US official said Friday that Blinken intends to make clear to his Arab counterparts that Israel told the US that the incursion is temporary — and that the US expects it to be. That policy could change, however, next month when the Trump administration takes office, this official conceded.

Nancy Pelosi underwent a “successful” hip replacement surgery Saturday and is “well on the mend,” according to a spokesperson, one day after being hospitalized from an injury sustained during an official engagement in Luxembourg.  Pelosi was admitted to a hospital in Luxembourg as the result of a fall on the stairs, three sources told CNN. Pelosi’s office declined to comm﻿ent on how the California congresswoman was injured.  Pelosi, 84, is receiving “excellent care” from doctors and medical professionals, Ian Krager, the spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday.  The US military had medevaced the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. The medical center is a major military hospital that for years has treated US troops injured in combat.  “While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,” Krager said Friday.  Pelosi is “currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals. She continues to work and regrets that she is unable to attend the remainder of the CODEL engagements to honor the courage of our servicemembers during one of the greatest acts of American heroism in our nation’s history,” Krager said, adding that Pelosi “looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.”  The injury sustained by Pelosi came just days after longtime Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell tripped and fell at the US Capitol, spraining his wrist and cutting his face.  McConnell sustained a “minor cut to the face” and was “cleared to resume his schedule,” a spokesperson for the 82-year-old Kentucky Republican said in a statement Tuesday.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-ban-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"CNN —  TikTok has plans for another appeal as it faces a ban on January 19.  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected a temporary pause on the ban of TikTok, calling such a block “unwarranted” and paving the way for the Supreme Court to potentially decide the fate of the popular video-sharing app.  In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that required TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, to be sold to a non-Chinese company. The latest ruling follows last week’s decision by the same appeals court to uphold the law, citing national security concerns.  The Biden administration previously urged the appeals court not to issue a temporary block on the law, arguing that doing so might allow the company to wait months to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, effectively halting the law indefinitely.  “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said on December 6.  What will TikTok’s next appeal look like?  The Supreme Court could make a quick decision on the case. Both TikTok and the federal government previously asked the appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the January 19 ban.  But the Supreme Court, which has a six-justice conservative majority, seems likely to rule in favor of upholding the ban, Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN earlier this month.  “I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” Schiller said.  Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN earlier this month that the Supreme Court may decide not to review the case at all, in which case TikTok is out of luck.  Do you need to delete the app?  Not necessarily.  The Department of Justice said Wednesday that, if the ban takes effect, it would “not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok” for the app’s more than 170 million monthly users. But don’t expect any more updates from the app or the ability to download it, if the ban takes place.  Two leaders of the US House of Representatives’ committee on China sent a bipartisan letter to the CEOs of Apple and Google parent company Alphabet that said they should prepare to remove TikTok from their US app stores on January 19.  TikTok will also be unavailable on internet hosting platforms. The Justice Department warned users can expect the app to “eventually” be unworkable.  Can the ban be avoided?  There’s still some hope that TikTok could remain active in the United States, though ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell it.  The ban’s legislation leaves room for Biden to grant a one-time, 90-day extension if he determines a company has made progress toward a sale. He hasn’t suggested any plans to do so.  President-elect Donald Trump, who begins his term a day after the ban, could be on TikTok’s side. He said in July (in a video posted to the app) that he would “never ban TikTok” — although he did try to ban it during his first term.  There are a few options: Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, though experts say that’s unlikely to be successful. He could also direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month.",US,TikTok’s ban won’t be delayed.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-shop-ban/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"CNN —  Aakaanksh Autade was iffy on TikTok Shop, TikTok’s in-app shopping feature, when it launched last year. Then the content creator grossed over $100,000 in sales when he hosted a live event on Black Friday and went from skeptic to believer.  Autade is known for sharing tech-related tips and tricks on his TikTok channel, “kaansanity.” He took to TikTok Live for the first time on Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend to promote gadgets like headphones and game consoles. “It was my first time going live, and to make $102,000 in 10 hours was just insane. I didn’t expect it at all,” he said.  Aakaanksh Autade (left) promoted gadgets like the Nintendo Switch via TikTok Live on Cyber Monday. Courtesy Aakaanksh Autade/kaansanity  TikTok Shop allows users to buy and sell products without leaving the app. The sales platform combines entertainment and retail, making it particularly popular among Gen Z buyers, and it continues to grow. It has over 500,000 sellers in the US, including brands like L’Oréal, PacSun and Scrub Daddy.  TikTok Shop raked in $100 million in single-day sales this Black Friday — that’s triple the number from 2023, according to the company. Over Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend alone, the shop saw a 165% increase in shoppers year-over-year, according to a statement by the company this month.  However, a US appeals court this month upheld a law that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 or face a US ban.  That ban could grind the sales platform’s progress to a halt — but creators who spoke to CNN say that they’re sticking with TikTok Shop anyway because they don’t think a ban will actually happen.  “I don’t think TikTok is going anywhere. I think they’re going to figure it out, and there’s so many people invested in TikTok,” Autade said. “It’s hard to ignore how much it means to its users.”  What makes TikTok Shop tick?  TikTok Shop provides a pipeline from discovery to purchase by letting users shop products featured in live videos, pinned on brand and influencer profiles, or tagged in content shown on their algorithm-driven For You page.  Even before the launch of its shopping feature, TikTok had already established a reputation as a place for users to find items to add to their wishlists. A study conducted in 2022 by marketing consulting firm Material Plus found that 61% of users purchased an item after seeing content about it on TikTok, helped by hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which has over 12 million posts.  Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and TikTok creator, said combining passive entertainment with a shopping function can tempt users to open their wallets.  “You’ve got all these people who are spending so much time just being (on TikTok) consuming and creating content,” she said. “When you mix in commerce with our favorite source of entertainment, then we’re going to spend all our money there.”  TikTok Shop’s reliance on user-generated content allows consumers to hear from voices they trust.  Lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk says TikTok Shop's main draw is its ability to let consumers see their favorite influencers use the products they promote in real time. Courtesy Carrie Berk  Social media strategist Keenya Kelly says that TikTok Shop is another avenue for content creators to make money on TikTok without having to leave the app. Courtesy Keenya Kelly  “If you see your favorite creator promoting a product on a live stream or a video, you’re more likely to buy it in that moment,” said Carrie Berk, a lifestyle content creator. The thinking among viewers, she said, is that “if a makeup influencer is promoting a product on TikTok Shop, if she says it’s good, then it must be good.”  TikTok users like Autade also say that the app’s focus on short-form videos gives it an edge over other social media platforms.  “When I click on a product and I can see hundreds or even thousands of people posting a video about that product authentically, that really helps,” he said. “On a different platform, I might just see some words, some reviews, some stars here and there,” but seeing the product in action is different.  Another component of TikTok Shop’s growth is its popularity with younger users. Some 62% of Gen Z consumers say that TikTok is their platform of choice when they need to look something up, beating out search engines like Google, according to a report by marketing technology company SOCi published this year.  “Gen Z as a whole has really chosen TikTok as their premier destination for content,” said Jen Jones, chief marketing officer of e-commerce platform Commercetools. “TikTok shop just seemed like a natural place for those dollars to be spent.”  What would a TikTok ban mean for other social media retail platforms?  Social media shopping is not a new phenomenon.  Ninety-two percent of retailers plan to invest more in social commerce this holiday season, according to a study by Commercetools published in October. The same study showed that Facebook Marketplace was the social commerce platform of choice for businesses, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok Shop and X.  In particular, Jones sees an opportunity for YouTube to fill in the space TikTok could leave behind if a ban comes into force.  She says that YouTube could potentially meet demand for the style of short-form videos popularized by TikTok through YouTube Shorts while capitalizing on its longer-form content.  In the past year alone, people watched over 30 billion hours of shopping-related content on YouTube, the company previously told CNN in an email. In 2023, it launched YouTube Shopping, allowing content creators to tag products from brands featured in their videos and earn commissions.  Experts say that if the TikTok ban happens, it will serve as a lesson for brands to not put all their eggs into one marketing basket.  The Shop tab of the TikTok app is seen on an iPhone on June 23 in Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images  “It’s just really important for companies to have a very diversified strategy when it comes to social shopping,” said Jones. “We know that social shopping is here to stay. You can’t get locked into just one platform.”  Kelly says the same advice applies to individual content creators who make money off their posts and videos, and recommends cultivating a following through more direct forms of outreach like email lists.  “We use social media to reach a group of people,” she said. “You need to pull those people off social media onto email so that you have control over your business.”  Still, Kelly says she sees no reason for content creators to be concerned over the court ruling that moves TikTok one step closer to a ban.  “I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, she said. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.”  Berk commands an audience of almost 4 million followers on TikTok and describes the social media platform as a big part of her livelihood, but she says she’s not worried by the prospect of a total ban next month.  “There has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical,” she said.  Autade still has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, but he told CNN that TikTok was his primary marketing avenue and the platform that has brought him the most success.  Even as the threat of a ban looms nearer, he says it’s still business as usual and plans to continue with a live event in January similar to the one he hosted on Black Friday.  “I’m still all-in on TikTok. I’m still living my day-to-day life, running my businesses, and everything’s pretty much the same until I hear otherwise,” Autade said.",US,TikTok Shop was going to be the next big thing.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked.",US,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,,,,0.021,0.948,0.031,0.2114
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/sony-stock-record/index.html,CNN,left,International,,"CNN —  The last time Sony was worth this much on the stock market, Bill Clinton was president and the PlayStation 2 was about to debut on American store shelves.  It’s been a rough past two and a half decades for Sony, the 78-year-old company that invented the Walkman and the PlayStation and had long been an icon of consumer electronics. It largely missed the boat on the mobile phone revolution, and while the PlayStation has been profitable, production costs for other electronics have risen while demand has softened.  But as opportunities arise in streaming, Sony is trying to transition from being a legacy consumer electronics company to an original content and entertainment company.  The strategy is working: In the past three years, Sony’s stock (SONY) has started to break out of a decades-long slump. Sony’s stock price in Japan recently closed at the first record high since March 2000, signifying confidence in the company’s ability to evolve its game offerings and steer itself toward entertainment, Damian Thong, a research equity analyst at Macquarie, told CNN.  “If you went back 30 years ago, it was an electronics company, so best known as a seller of hardware,” Thong said. “But today, the company is primarily generating profits off of entertainment, which is games, music and (TV and movies).”  Less hardware, more content  Sony Group, Japan’s third largest company by market value, has turned itself around by innovating its games business beyond consoles and making acquisitions to expand its IP, Joost van Dreunen, an adjunct assistant professor at NYU Stern who teaches the business of video games, told CNN.  Sony acquired Anime powerhouse Crunchyroll in 2021, and it acquired American video game company Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion.  In addition to Sony Interactive Entertainment, which makes the PlayStation, the behemoth Sony Group also includes Sony Pictures, which produces films like the Spider-Man series, and Sony Music, which includes Columbia Records.  Sony is trying to unlock synergy across its subsidiary companies to produce original entertainment content for consumers, van Dreunen said.  Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal in the first season of ""The Last of Us."" Liane Hentscher/HBO  That strategy of leveraging its intellectual property across its brands became apparent at the 75th Emmy Awards in January, when the TV series “The Last of Us” won eight primetime awards. It was the first time a TV show adapted from a videogame earned major consideration at a Hollywood awards ceremony.  It was a momentous occasion for Sony, which first published “The Last of Us” as a videogame in 2013 before it was adapted to become a TV series released in 2023 on HBO and Max. (HBO and Max share ownership with CNN.)  Without a streaming network of its own, licensing its intellectual property and original content is part of Sony’s strategy to compete with streaming giants like Netflix, Disney and Amazon.  Robert Lawson, the chief communications officer for Sony Group, said in a statement that since 2018 when the company acquired EMI publishing, making Sony Music the world’s largest publisher of music, Sony has invested approximately 1.5 trillion yen into content IP across various entertainment businesses.  “Sony Group has shifted its corporate strategies towards strengthening its creation and entertainment assets,” Lawson said, noting the company is focusing on “new collaborations between Sony sister companies,” including leaning heavily into the anime genre.  In the last fiscal year ending March, Sony’s entertainment business, which includes music, movies and games, accounted for 60% of total revenue. That’s double from a decade ago, when the entertainment business accounted for just 30% of total revenue.  A long road to dominance  Doubling down on entertainment represents a departure from Sony’s origins.  Before there was Sony, there was Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, founded in 1946 by Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka. The company released Japan’s first-ever magnetic tape record in 1950. In 1958, the company changed its name to Sony Corporation.  In the 1960s, Sony established its business in the United States. For the next three decades, the Japanese company emerged as a household name in consumer electronics, producing iconic devices from the Trinitron color TV in 1968 to the Walkman cassette player in 1979 to the world’s first CD player in 1982, in addition to numerous cameras and video recorders.  Sony has also been involved with music since the 1960s through a joint venture with CBS that became Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Yet it’s largely been known for its electronics.

Aflo/Shutterstock  The 1990s were a high point for Sony as it broke into the world of gaming consoles. With the release of the PlayStation in 1994, Sony disrupted the arcade and gaming industry.  Since the 1990s, Sony has been a dominant player in the videogame console business with iterations of the PlayStation. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, which has consistently outsold its main competitors like Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Nintendo’s Switch, according to data from Ampere Analysis, an analytics firm for the games business.  Van Dreunen said that Sony is also looking to evolve in gaming beyond its console business, looking for new audiences and methods of distribution.  “We’re currently going through a softer period in gaming, and so it really raises the stakes for companies like, what’s next?” he said. “How do you as the dominant console maker continue to innovate and continue to grow your business?”  An original PlayStation is pictured at a display of various memorabilia in the lobby of the Sony headquarters building in central Tokyo on November 27, 2024.

Brooks/AFP/Getty Images  A customer walks away after purchasing the new Sony Playstation PS5 in Seoul on November 12, 2020, after Sony launched the new console in select markets around the world. Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images  Thong said that Sony has been successful in becoming a profitable channel for third-party publishers to sell videogames.  Sony has tried to diversify its strategy toward gaming, including publishing a videogame called Helldivers 2 across PlayStation5 and also PC. Helldivers 2 was a hit for Sony and sold over 12 million copies within three months of its release, according to Anna Kerr, a research manager for games at Ampere Analytics.  “The games business is spreading out its IP,” NYU Stern’s van Dreunen said. “It’s looking for new ways to reach customers, to expand that customer reach.”  In November, Sony announced a 69% percent jump in net quarterly profit, driven in part by its game segment. The company has had consistently strong quarters this year, driven by profitability in its games.  The company is now in talks to acquire Kadokawa, a Japanese videogame powerhouse that produces the popular videogame “Elden Ring,” according to people familiar with the matter.  There have been some headwinds: Sony’s rollout of the “Concord” vieogame and Sony Pictures’ latest installment of the Spider-Man universe were largely flops among fans this year. However, they are trial and error runs, van Dreunen said, and manageable expenditures for a company that has denoted 1.8 trillion yen ($11 billion) for acquisitions and stock buybacks through March 2027.  In May, at Sony’s annual investor conference, Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida said that the company was embracing a “creative entertainment vision.”  Sony’s emergence as an entertainment company was not always certain, Thong said.  “Sony had some years of quite substantial pain, I would say,” Thong said. “And I think to their credit, they managed to weather and see through it.”  Bringing Sony IP to the big screen  Van Dreunen said in the past, there wasn’t as much demand for videogame adaptations for movie and TV. Yet “The Last of Us” showed that Sony had an opportunity to bring more Sony IP to the big screen.  Before “The Last of Us,” Sony also tried its hand at videogame adaptation with “Uncharted,” a 2022 movie featuring actor Tom Holland that was based on a video game franchise first published by Sony in 2007.

Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg/Getty Images  Additionally, Sony is planning to adapt videogame franchise “God of War,” which it first published in 2005, to the big screen next year, Kerr said.  Sony is still in the electronics business, Thong said, noting its image sensors business works with companies like Apple and it produces high-end cameras. However, it has shed its identity as a mass consumer electronics company.  In 2025, Sony intends to spin off its online banking and insurance units, further doubling down on its entertainment offerings.

It’s a patchwork built over decades.”  Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.  “Together with employers, governments and others who pay for care, we need to improve how we explain what insurance covers and how decisions are made,” Witty wrote. “Behind each decision lies a comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety.”  Witty also praised UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was killed in midtown Manhattan last week, writing that Thompson “fought for preventive health and quality health outcomes rather than simply adding ever more tests and procedures.”  In a statement on Friday, UnitedHealthcare said “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company’s treatment of insurance claims” and that it “approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission,” noting that “around one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons.”  Will changes be made?  Thompson’s fatal shooting pushed Americans’ dissatisfaction with their health insurance into the spotlight. Many have made their frustrations abundantly clear on social media.  Journalists have also chronicled insurers’ efforts to twist the system to their benefit. STAT, a news site that focuses on health care, has published a series of investigative stories on UnitedHealth, including articles on how the nation’s largest health insurer uses a computer algorithm to cut off rehabilitation care for Medicare enrollees, limiting clinical case managers’ discretion.  Whether the public outcry prompts UnitedHealthcare and other insurers to adjust their practices — particularly the much-maligned denials of treatment and claims — or pushes lawmakers to force the industry to make changes remains to be seen. It depends, in part, on whether patients continue making their voices heard, experts say.  Angry consumers have had success in overhauling the health insurance industry in the past. They railed against the restrictions of health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, in the 1990s, as captured in the 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” That helped spur insurers to offer more preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, which have fewer constraints but are more costly.  Any shifts in the nation’s complex health care system, however, will not come easily, nor quickly, experts say. There are many players involved, each of which has its own patient care concerns, financial interests and lobbying dollars to influence lawmakers.  UnitedHealthcare’s mission  While many patients and their advocates argue that insurers deny care to pad their profits, the industry maintains that it is protecting consumers from high prices and unnecessary care.  Soon after Thompson’s murder, Witty vowed in an internal message to employees to continue the insurer’s mission of helping “the system improve.”  “Our role is a critical role, and we make sure that care is safe, appropriate, and it’s delivered when people need it,” said Witty in a video message obtained by CNN. “And we guard against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex and ultimately unsustainable. So we’re going to continue to make that case.”  “What we know to be true is that the health system needs a company like UnitedHealth Group,” he continued.  Asked Thursday whether it will make any changes in response to consumers’ public complaints, UnitedHealthcare referred CNN to Witty’s video. Other major insurers either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment, but a leading industry association said that hospitals, providers and employers all have “a direct impact on the cost and accessibility of medical services.”  “In the fragmented and heavily regulated health care system, health plans, providers and drugmakers share a responsibility to make high-quality care as affordable as possible and easier to navigate for the people we collectively serve,” AHIP, the trade group, said in a statement. “Health plans are working to protect patients from the full impact of rising costs while connecting them to care that is safe, evidence-based and coordinated.”  But the recent events may prompt insurers to investigate their practices and make some changes, Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in an email to CNN. This is especially likely if they see risks to their businesses, such as if employers threaten to leave because coverage decisions are too onerous for their workers.  On the flip side, “the main reason to not change their practices is to maintain their profitability while also keeping costs reasonable in a broad sense for their clients and end users,” Utterback wrote.

Hear why. 01:43 - Source: CNN  The HMO backlash  Though former President Bill Clinton failed to reform health care in the early 1990s, his administration’s efforts spurred increased concerns over the cost of care. That cued the growth of the HMO model, which allowed policyholders to see only certain doctors and required referrals from primary care physicians to see specialists and get certain tests and procedures. But HMOs also typically featured low premiums, low or no co-pays and no deductibles.  Policyholders rebelled because they felt they couldn’t access the care they needed, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.  Their angst was captured in extensive media coverage and in the 1997 film “As Good As It Gets,” when a young boy’s mother (played by Helen Hunt) tells a doctor (played by Harold Ramis) that her insurer would not cover an allergy test for her son’s asthma.  “F**king HMO, bastard pieces of sh*t,” Hunt says, before apologizing.  “That’s ok. Actually, I think that’s their technical name,” Ramis replies.  Many states responded to the complaints by passing patients’ bills of rights that limited HMO cost-control practices in state-regulated plans. Employers, who were hearing from angry workers, began shifting to PPOs, which generally provide coverage for a wider range of doctors but have much higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. PPOs have now largely eclipsed the managed care model.  But as health care costs continue to skyrocket, PPOs are instituting practices that resemble those of HMOs, particularly requiring approval of care in advance, known as prior authorization, Levitt said.  “If you think health care costs are rough now, imagine them without constraints,” said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+, a health care consulting group, and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.  Health insurers, however, do at times backtrack when faced with intense blowback. Earlier this month, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield halted its plan to limit the amount of time it would cover anesthesia used in surgeries and procedures after criticism from doctors and politicians. The policy was designed to reduce overbilling and make care more affordable, the insurer had said.  Efforts in Congress  Congress has tried for years to improve access to care and curtail costs, which are far higher in the US than in its peers even though it ranks last on key health measures. Lawmakers have held hearings and introduced bills, but there haven’t been comprehensive reforms enacted since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 — aside from several significant Medicare drug cost provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.  An effort to improve the prior authorization process in Medicare Advantage plans failed to advance in the Senate in 2022 after the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost about $16 billion over a decade.  However, there is now more bipartisan appetite on Capitol Hill to enact reforms, said Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive and vocal critic of the health care industry. Lawmakers reintroduced the prior authorization bill, which now comes with a zero cost estimate, and released a framework to establish so-called site-neutral payments in Medicare, under which Medicare would pay the same rate for a service provided in a hospital outpatient department, an ambulatory surgical center or physician’s office.  Plus, lawmakers are looking at reforms to the pharmacy benefit manager industry, which serves as a middleman between health insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers.  Republicans, who will control Congress starting in January, will be looking for cost savings to offset extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Whitlock said. That could push them to pass measures that would save the government money, such as site-neutral payments.  Meanwhile, the murder of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO will remain in the news as the case against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, winds its way through the court system. That will keep public frustration with health insurers in the spotlight – and could help advance legislation on Capitol Hill, Potter said.  “It will be a years long fight, but it’s going to happen,” he said. “Some kind of reform is inevitable.”",US,UnitedHealth Group CEO: America’s health system is poorly designed,,,,0.082,0.791,0.127,0.9982

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/us/drone-sightings-new-jersey-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"New York CNN —  Federal agencies are facing intense pressure to give the public more details on unexplained drone sightings in the New York City metropolitan area and beyond that have been going on for weeks over residential neighborhoods as well as restricted sites and critical infrastructure.  On Saturday, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey posted on X about the “growing number of drone sightings” there, making her state the latest to report such sightings, joining New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.  Federal officials have sought to calm the concerns about the sightings, but without giving further details about what they might be. They say there’s no evidence of a public safety threat, and many of the reported sightings are cases of mistaken identity.  “The bottom line is this: They’re not providing enough information to the public, and the public is concerned,” US Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Friday. “Believe me, I’m hearing from my constituents about this all the time, and I think it’s time for them to immediately get out there and brief.”  A drone sighting prompted the temporary closure of runways at New York’s Stewart International Airport on Friday night, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the Orange County airport about 70 miles north of New York City.  There were no impacts to the airport’s flight operations during the closure, which lasted about an hour, according to the Port Authority, which was alerted to the sighting by the Federal Aviation Administration.  “This has gone too far,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement Saturday, adding that last month she “directed the New York State Intelligence Center to actively investigate drone sightings and coordinate with federal law enforcement to address this issue.”  Earlier Friday, New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis called the response to the sightings “outrageous,” saying there are “drones and unmanned aerial systems flying above us and our government is not telling us who’s operating them and for what purpose?”  Malliotakis joined Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella in demanding answers.  Fossella said the drones, often seen flying at night, have been spotted hovering over critical infrastructures including Port Liberty New York near the Goethals Bridge, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and Fort Wadsworth, one of the oldest military installations in the country.  Representatives of the federal agencies investigating the drones who have briefed local officials behind closed doors said the drones sometimes appear to fly in a coordinated pattern and can sometimes be in flight for up to six hours, according to Montvale, New Jersey, Mayor Mike Ghassali.  And though federal officials have said there is no evidence the drone sightings pose a public safety threat, Belleville, New Jersey, Mayor Michael Melham has said he has received guidance police should call the county bomb squad if they encounter a downed drone.  In addition, local fire departments should wear hazmat suits when they respond, Melham said, saying the information was shared by his Office of Emergency Management following recent state-level meetings.  “We just don’t know what these things are, so we are being cautious,” Melham said.  Skepticism over government response  One New Jersey lawmaker is accusing federal officials of lying about the presence and purpose of the mysterious drones.  “They’re lying. That’s the long and the short of it,” Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson said in an interview Saturday with CNN’s Victor Blackwell.  Like several other officials and lawmakers, Peterson said he’s personally seen drones hovering near his rural New Jersey home, where he said the absence of street lights and nearby flight paths allows for clear visibility.  Peterson referenced the government’s response to the Chinese spy balloon that traversed over parts of the United States in 2023 to illustrate his point that the government is either embarrassed or unwilling to disclose the truth about the mystery drones due to security concerns.  “Why would you lie? Either because the reason that this is happening is incredibly embarrassing to the administration or it’s an incredibly high security risk for the country and they don’t want to tell us,” he said.  President-elect Donald Trump, meanwhile, has called on the Biden administration to either release any information it has about the mysterious sightings or shoot the drones out of the sky.  “Mystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government’s knowledge. I don’t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!! DJT,” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Friday his agency knows of “no threat or of any nefarious activity” related to the sightings.  Mayorkas pledged to be transparent “if we learn of any cause for concern.”  Officials are currently prioritizing the use of sophisticated radio frequency technology that can geolocate the operator of a drone, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.  There are multiple technical capabilities authorities can use to try and “defeat” a drone, including jamming a signal, disconnecting it from the operator or remotely “hijack” a drone but every option can pose numerous risks, the source said.  “Blowing it out of the sky is the last resort,” the source said, noting the option is always on the table if an aircraft presents a threat.  Federal and state officials said using offensive techniques to bring down the drones poses an unnecessary risk to people on the ground and legal challenges, especially as they have not been deemed threatening, the source said.  New Jersey’s Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has formally requested additional resources from the Biden administration to better address the ongoing situation.  “While I am sincerely grateful for your administration’s leadership in addressing this concerning issue, it has become apparent that more resources are needed to fully understand what is behind this activity,” Murphy said in a letter dated Thursday.  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.  Murphy’s concerns come as Naval Weapons Station Earle, a US Navy base south of Middletown, New Jersey, acknowledged Friday it had spotted “several instances of unidentified drones entering the airspace” above the facility despite no direct threats being identified.  “The base remains prepared to respond to any potential risks, leveraging robust security measures and advanced detection capabilities,” station spokesperson Bill Addison said in an email to CNN, adding there are airspace restrictions above the station.  The energy company PSEG on Saturday said it has “contacted the appropriate authorities” about reports of drones flying over its Salem and Hope Creek nuclear power plants in New Jersey.  Democratic Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey posted videos to his X account showing what appeared to be a cluster of drones over the Round Valley Reservoir Thursday night.  “This has gone on for weeks,” Kim wrote. “It’s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren’t able to track these devices to determine origin and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and counter measures.”  Last night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here’s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn — Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024  Morris County, about 30 miles west of New York City, issued a statement calling for “the federal government to marshal all federal resources at its disposal, including the military, to end the unauthorized flight of drones over our county and other parts of New Jersey.”  “Morris County and our communities have deployed considerable resources daily since the first drones were spotted,” the statement continued.  The Somerset County Sheriff’s Office similarly said in a Facebook post they had “increased vigilance” at sensitive locations and “are analyzing data and information on a daily basis.”  New York State Police said Friday afternoon in a post on X they had received “numerous reports of drone sightings over the past 24 hours” and they were investigating the reports. “We have no evidence at this time that any of the reported sightings pose a public safety threat,” reads the post.  Connecticut State Police announced Friday they have deployed a drone detection system to assist in investigative efforts into unauthorized drone sightings reported over Fairfield County.  “It’s very unsettling to public safety and security, both here in Fairfield and elsewhere,” Republican state Sen. Tony Hwang said in a statement Friday.  “What we have is a lack of information at all levels of government. It’s really a breakdown of communication. Without that vital communication, you lose the public’s confidence, you get speculation and you get fear,” he said.  And in Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro said his administration is “aware of” the reported drone sightings and is taking them seriously. The Democratic governor said Friday evening he directed the Pennsylvania State Police to look further into the sightings, and police will be flying helicopters to try to “determine where these drones are originating from and what the purpose of these drones are.”  White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby, in a press briefing Thursday, said there was “no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus.”  Kirby added many of “the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully.”  Mayorkas echoed Kirby’s explanation Friday, telling CNN some reported drone sightings were cases of “mistaken identity.”  Addressing calls to shoot down unidentified drones, he said, “It’s not as though anyone can just take down a drone in the sky. That in and of itself would be dangerous.”  Mayorkas added he has been in communication with New Jersey’s governor daily.  Congress briefed on drone sightings  Officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI briefed top committees in the House and Senate as well as a delegation of New Jersey lawmakers on the reported drone sightings, a source familiar with the situation tells CNN. The source said while there have been eyewitness reports of what appear to be drones over New Jersey, agency officials stressed in meetings Thursday many videos on social media appear to be civilian airplanes or helicopters.  “I don’t believe with all of these sightings, none of them are drones,” Gottheimer said, adding, “You can’t have the Wild West of drones out there,” with unmanned aircraft threatening infrastructure.  The New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness said there was “an active federal investigation” into the drone sightings, but elected officials want to hear more.  “We should be doing smart intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” US Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who sits on the Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said Thursday. “They should be shot down, if necessary, because they’re flying over sensitive areas.”  Residents in New York’s Rockland County reported drone sightings starting as early as November.  County Executive Ed Day sent a letter to President Joe Biden Friday seeking answers and urging his administration, along with the FAA and FBI, to investigate and provide clarity on the matter.  “The fact that this issue has persisted for weeks without clear answers is completely unacceptable — not just to the people of Rockland County, but to communities across the nation,” Day said in the letter. “It’s time for the Federal government to step up, take responsibility, and provide the answers we all deserve.”  Malliotakis said the situation “is creating havoc, people are confused, they’re concerned, they have anxiety, they don’t know what’s going on.”  No foreign involvement suspected by feds  The US intelligence community and federal law enforcement do not suspect foreign involvement in the drone sightings across New Jersey, security officials told members of Congress Thursday at one private briefing.  Key lawmakers assigned to congressional national security committees were told investigators do not currently believe the sightings involved an overseas connection, the use of foreign drones, nor an operator on the ground connected to a foreign government, according to a source familiar with the briefing conducted by representatives from the FBI, FAA and the Department of Homeland Security.  Officials said sighted drones have been observed with FAA-required anticollision lights and are not believed to have entered any restricted airspaces, according to the source.  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, New Jersey, on Dec. 5. Brian Glenn/TMX/AP  While authorities have not yet identified the origin of the mysterious drone flights, the source said an active FBI investigation remains underway to identify the person or persons operating them, and to determine whether any criminal violations of law have occurred.  Some of the more recent drone operations may be from copycats trying to play on people’s worries as the sightings get more news coverage, former FBI supervisory special agent Tom Adams told CNN. He said there are often innocent explanations, as well.  “I can tell you from my firsthand experience conducting operations for the FBI, as well as investigations into the suspected sighting of drones at critical infrastructure, it was fairly common for planets, crewed aircraft and even low Earth orbit satellites to be misidentified as drones at night,” Adams said.  Drones – unmanned aerial vehicles – are widely owned across the US. A total of 791,597 drones are registered with the FAA, split almost evenly between commercial drones and recreational drones.  Although the drones often display flashing lights, they frequently turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday.  The FAA issued temporary flight restrictions over the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster after drones were spotted in those areas, one week after the FAA received its first report of an unauthorized drone operation in the New York metro area on November 18.  “Until you know the origin and what these drones’ intent is, how can you tell me there’s no imminent threat?” Mayor Tony Perry of Middletown, New Jersey, told CNN Thursday.  Feds rarely coordinate drone info with locals  The sense that local officials are being left in the dark is partially a result of outdated laws keeping regulation of the skies entirely in federal hands, according to the chief executive of a company tracking unauthorized drone flights.  “The laws that regulate aircraft are not built to empower police to deal with the drones,” Axon CEO Rick Smith told CNN News Central Friday, “so if your local state fair has a drone coming towards it that police believe might be dangerous, right now there’s nothing they can do about it.”  Hochul, the Democratic New York governor, called on Congress to pass the Counter-UAS Authority Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act, which she said would give state and local authorities more power in dealing with unmanned aircraft systems and strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones.  The governor said that until these “powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden Administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  FAA regulations allow operators of recreational drones to fly up to 400 feet above the ground in airspace not controlled by FAA air traffic controllers. The FAA does grant waivers on a case-by-case basis to those wanting to operate drones in more congested airspace or at higher altitudes.  Giving local law enforcement more authority over drones is under consideration, Smith said, because traditional aircraft tracking technology is ineffective for vehicles hovering only a few hundred feet off the ground.  “The same radar and tracking system you use for a 747 just doesn’t work,” said Smith.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process with the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items which may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  FBI: San Francisco police recognized suspect  On Friday, the FBI told CNN they received a tip from the San Francisco Police Department, saying an officer with the department’s Special Victims Unit had recognized Mangione as a possible suspect on December 5 after seeing the surveillance photos of the suspect’s unmasked face.  The San Francisco Chronicle first reported on the tip Thursday.  Chronicle reporter Megan Cassidy told CNN’s John Berman her team reported “a few days ago” on the existence of a missing persons report in San Francisco for Mangione.  “Apparently, there was somebody at SFPD that was looking into the missing persons case, and after the shooting of Brian Thompson, recognized this person and called in this tip, or emailed this tip, to the FBI,” Cassidy said.  The FBI then sent the tip to New York investigators during the manhunt, the agency told CNN.  CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explained on Friday’s “AC360” how the tip ultimately made its way to the FBI in New York and the NYPD.  “This tip comes from, I think, a victim witness specialist in the San Francisco Police Department who had that missing persons case somewhere in front of them and looked at that face and says, ‘Gee, that could be the guy that is on these FBI posters all over town,’ so SFPD sends that to San Francisco FBI,” Miller said.  “San Francisco FBI says, ‘that’s a New York office case,’” he added.  Miller explained the FBI’s New York office likely sent the information to a violent crimes squad composed of a mix of FBI agents and NYPD officers.  “They look at it and they do a workup on the name, checking, you know, any indicators that guy’s been in New York, and then they send it over to NYPD,” Miller said.  By Sunday, the tip joined 200 viable leads being examined by authorities, according to Miller.  “Then Monday morning, at 9:15 in the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, another tip leads to the capture,” he said. “So you see, these leads are piling up, being tasked out and being worked, and this was in that pile coming up because it was a viable lead. It’s just that destiny took a hand quicker.”  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.

CNN —  I’m not much of a hugger. Sure, I’ll bust out the warm fuzzies for relatives around the holidays but I’m not like, say, my best friend, who prefers her hugs to produce the bone-liquifying pressure of an industrial vise. My husband loves to tell the story of our first date, when he approached me with open arms and I maneuvered him into a firm, businesslike handshake. Touch is just not my love language! And if you’re also not a hugger, the holidays are a gauntlet of outstretched arms and sweatered bosoms and unfamiliar colognes. We’ll make it through together! I recently watched some interviews with the lead actresses of the new “Wicked” film (which is sooo so good), and each tends to clutch the other’s single beautifully taloned finger when things get deep. I do that too! It is emotionally supportive without being suffocating (literally or figuratively). Fingertip-to-fingertip touching is the new hugging, pass it on.  Here’s all the good things that happened this week.  Nana Kyei  1. The Friendship Queen Diaries  It’s like something out of a movie: Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in 1996. Now, she’s a queen in Ghana. Despite her challenging youth, Johnson made sure she and her daughter were well-traveled, and after discovering she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, she founded a travel company to organize trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Her work attracted the attention of the Dakpema, a governing body in northern Ghana. She was blown away when they asked her to accept the title of “Zosimli Naa,” or “Friendship Queen.” The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the centuries-old Dagbon Kingdom, which comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in the city of Tamale, where she now lives. “We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.  CNN  2. Fabric of rebirth  The iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is finally open to the public again after a devastating fire damaged it five years ago. As part of this rebirth, fashion designer and artist Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was asked to create new vestments, or special service garments, for the cathedral’s clergy. Vestments are an important part of a church’s identity and de Castelbajac said the theme for the new look was “noble simplicity.” The designer drew inspiration from Notre Dame’s stained glass and blonde stone, creating a look that he said speaks to tradition and innovation; old and new. The vision was “radiant with color, radiant of hope, radiant of faith,” de Castelbajac told CNN. You can see details of the vestments in the photo above, and learn more about de Castelbajac’s process in this video.  CNN  3. Music on the brain  If you’ve ever shared your life with someone with dementia or another progressive neurological disease, you know music can be magic. Toronto-based company LUCID is combining facial mapping software, artificial intelligence, and music to create a therapy for older patients dealing with health challenges like Alzheimer’s, dementia and even depression and anxiety. The treatment involves measuring how a person’s brain reacts to music and combining that with facial mapping and artificial intelligence. Using this data, the technology can create specific playlists that hopefully can alleviate stress, restlessness, confusion and emotional discomfort in dementia patients.  Natalia Botero-Acosta  4. I would swim 500 miles  This whale puts The Proclaimers to shame! A male humpback whale has completed an extraordinary record-breaking migration, swimming more than 8,000 miles from South America to Africa. The humpback was first spotted off the coast of Colombia in 2013 and seen again a few years later not far from its original location. But in 2022, the whale was unexpectedly detected in the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa. The typical migration route for humpback whales can approach 5,000 miles in a single direction, making this one’s journey close to two times that of most whales. The discovery also marks the first documentation of an adult male humpback traveling between the Pacific and Indian oceans.

She co-founded the award-winning restaurant Takya, located in the 600-year-old historic center of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. Though the food has all the artfully prepared aura of a high-class restaurant, the menu is inspired by the traditional home cooking Al Motawa grew up with, and by her travels around Saudi Arabia and abroad. After seeing the deep connection between food and culture, Al Motawa wanted to “bring that same connection back home, to create a space where people could rediscover the beauty of Saudi cuisine.” Saudi Arabia itself is a country of great geographical, and thus culinary, diversity. For example, the Eastern Province is known for its seafood, such as Muhammar, a fried fish dish made with rice and sugar that was traditionally popular among sailors. In the country’s northern region, where temperatures are cooler and may drop below freezing during winter, traditional recipes focus on grains and meat, like the popular jareesh, a lamb stew made with wheat and yogurt.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said. Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and about 300 miles northwest of Sacramento.",US,Downtown San Francisco experiences first tornado warning in recorded history,,,,0.138,0.835,0.026,-0.989
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/crystal-mangum-duke-lacrosse-allegations/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  More than 18 years after accusing three former Duke University lacrosse players of raping her, a falsified account she shared in graphic detail, Crystal Mangum has admitted she lied about the encounter.  In an interview on a web show published Wednesday, Mangum apologized to the men and said her relationship with God has made her understand why she fabricated the story. Mangum is serving time in prison on a second-degree murder conviction for killing her boyfriend.  The timeline of the North Carolina case begins in 2006, when Mangum said she was trapped inside a bathroom, sexually assaulted and raped by David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann at a team party where she was performing as an exotic dancer. The men were arrested following her allegations.  “I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn’t, and that was wrong. And I betrayed the trust of a lot of other people who believed in me,” Mangum said on Katerena DePasquale’s show, “Let’s Talk with Kat.” “I made up a story that wasn’t true because I wanted validation from people and not from God.”  David Evans, left, Collin Finnerty, center, and Reade Seligmann, right, look on during a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2007. Chuck Burton/AP/File  For more than a year, the school and the lacrosse players were thrust into a media frenzy, subjected to intense public scrutiny and damaging allegations of sexual assault that were ultimately dropped.  After Mangum’s confession, Duke told CNN on Friday it would not comment. The former players did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.  Here’s how the events unfolded.  A timeline of the events  • March 13, 2006: Mangum is hired as a dancer for a private party held by members of the Duke men’s lacrosse team. It takes place at a house on North Buchanan Boulevard in Durham. Mangum later accuses several players of raping her during the party early on March 14.  • March 28, 2006: Duke President Richard Brodhead suspends team play for the men’s lacrosse team, a move widely criticized as premature since no formal charges had been made yet. Media attention intensifies, with early reports painting a picture of privileged, White lacrosse players being accused by a Black woman. The case becomes a flashpoint for issues of race, class and privilege, according to the Washington Post.  • March 28-30, 2006: DNA tests on Mangum’s body fail to link any of the lacrosse players to the scene, according to a disciplinary order against prosecutor Mike Nifong by the North Carolina State Bar, but Nifong insists on moving forward with the case. Skepticism about the case begins to mount.  • April 18, 2006: Nifong formally charges Seligmann and Finnerty with rape, according to the disciplinary order. The charges are based largely on Mangum’s testimony, as forensic evidence was either inconclusive or absent.  • May 15, 2006: Nifong formally charges Evans with rape, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 5, 2006: Duke announces the lacrosse team is reinstated to play in the following fall, but public sentiment has already soured.  • December 28, 2006: Nifong is accused of withholding evidence and making misleading statements to the press, leading to an investigation by the state bar, according to the disciplinary order.  • April 11, 2007: Roy Cooper – then the state’s Attorney General and now its governor – announces “there is insufficient evidence to proceed on any of the charges” in a statement shared by Duke Athletics. The charges are dropped.  “We believe that these cases were the result of a tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations,” Cooper said. “Based on the significant inconsistencies between the evidence and the various accounts given by the accusing witness, we believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges.”  • June 16, 2007: Nifong loses his law license following disciplinary hearings about his handling of the case, including accusations of ethical misconduct and withholding evidence. His disbarment is finalized by the state bar in July, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 18, 2007: Duke announces that it has settled with the three lacrosse players, agreeing to pay a confidential settlement.  “It is impossible to fully describe what we, our families and team endured. As we said from day one, we are innocent,” Evans, Finnerty and Seligmann said in a statement. “But it took three hundred and ninety-four days, and the intervention of the North Carolina Attorney General, before our innocence was formally declared.”  • October 5, 2007: The three players file a civil lawsuit against the city of Durham, Nifong and other individuals, according to court documents. Durham later settles the lawsuit in part with a one-time grant of $50,000 to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.  • April 3, 2011: Mangum is charged with stabbing her boyfriend, leading to a lengthy criminal trial, and is convicted of second-degree murder in 2013.  ‘I hope they can forgive me’  Mangum has spent 11 years in prison, which she is getting through by reading the Bible and finding humor in her thoughts, she said in her interview with “Let’s Talk with Kat.”  She wishes she could help children who were sexually abused, she told DePasquale. When asked if she could describe her experience in prison in one word, she says: “Growth.”  Before becoming an exotic dancer, she studied psychology at North Carolina Central University. The transition came from her searching for “validation,” she said in the interview.  “I was looking for love and acceptance from people,” she said. “People to love me, to accept me, to pay attention to me for validation. But you can get all of that in Jesus. He loves us just the way we are. That’s what I learned in prison.  “I hurt my brothers and I hope they can forgive me and I want them to know that I love them and they didn’t deserve that and I hope they can forgive me. I hope they can heal.”  The danger of false rape allegations for actual victims  An advocate for victims of sexual assault said rare cases like this might discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and cause people to wrongly doubt them.  “False reports hurt not only the people falsely accused, they hurt every rape victim,” Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, vice president of communications for RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, told CNN. “There are already too many victims who do not report the crime for fear of not being believed. After a false report in such a high-profile case, even more survivors may be reluctant to come forward out of fear that law enforcement will not believe them.”  A study published by Violence Against Women in 2010 found that false sexual assault reports range from between 2 to 10 percent. A majority of sexual assaults, an estimated 63 percent, are never reported to the police, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.  Kaleba said she encourages people to consider the nearly half million victims in the US of rape and sexual assault each year who may now face renewed disbelief and question the value of reporting sexual violence.  “Don’t allow infrequent, false reporting to stand in the way of standing with survivors,” Kaleba said.",US,Duke lacrosse scandal: Crystal Mangum admits to false rape allegations,,,,0.186,0.723,0.091,-0.9993
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor.",US,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,,,,0.113,0.794,0.093,-0.9676
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/kirstin-lobato-las-vegas-verdict/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"Las Vegas AP —  A federal jury in Nevada has awarded more than $34 million to a woman who was arrested at age 18, wrongly convicted twice, and served nearly 16 years in a Nevada state prison for a 2001 killing she did not commit.  Kirstin Lobato, who is now 41 and uses the name Blaise, cried and hugged her attorneys after a judge read the trial verdict Thursday in US District Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  “It’s been an uphill battle with many, many obstacles,” she told reporters. “And I’m happy that it’s all finally finished.”  Lobato said she didn’t know if becoming a millionaire would make up for years in prison, adding that she had “no idea what the rest of my life is going to look like.”  The civil trial jury found Las Vegas police and two detectives, now retired, fabricated evidence during their investigation and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Lobato. The panel determined that Lobato should receive $34 million in compensatory damages from the department and $10,000 in punitive damages from each former detective.  The detectives, Thomas Thowsen and James LaRochelle, and their attorney, Craig Anderson, declined to comment outside court. Anderson told US District Judge Richard Boulware he planned to file additional court documents following the verdict. Anderson said Friday an appeal was “likely.”  The department previously agreed to pay damages if the jury ruled in Lobato’s favor.  Lobato was 18 when she was interviewed by police without an attorney, arrested and charged with killing Duran Bailey in Las Vegas in July 2001. Bailey, who had been homeless, was found dead near a trash bin with a slashed neck, cracked skull and missing genitals.  No physical evidence or witnesses connected Lobato to the killing, and she maintained she never met Bailey. But police maintained she confessed in jail that she had killed a man who tried to rape her during a three-day methamphetamine binge.  Lobato was 19 when she was convicted of murder in 2002. The Nevada Supreme Court threw out that verdict and Lobato’s prison sentence in 2004 because her lawyers weren’t able to cross-examine a prosecution witness who testified that Lobato made the jailhouse confession.  Lobato was tried again in 2006, convicted of manslaughter, mutilation and weapon charges, and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.  She was exonerated and freed from prison in late 2017 after the Innocence Project and attorneys in Las Vegas again took her case to the state Supreme Court. Justices said evidence showed that Lobato was in her hometown of Panaca, Nevada, some 150 miles from Las Vegas when Bailey was killed.  Last October, a state court judge in Las Vegas issued a certificate declaring Lobato innocent of Bailey’s killing.  That action was challenged by Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson in a letter asking state Attorney General Aaron Ford to investigate how and why attorneys for Lobato acquired the certificate of innocence.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/baby-garnet-cold-case-michigan/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  It was the middle of Jenna Gerwatowski’s workday at the local flower shop in Newberry, Michigan, when she got a call from an unknown number.  The now 23-year-old doesn’t usually answer unknown calls, but says she decided to pick this one up in May 2022.  To her surprise, it was a detective from the Michigan state police.  “He was like, ‘Have you heard of the Baby Garnet case?’” Jenna told CNN.  Jenna had heard of it. In 1997, a deceased infant was found in a campground pit toilet at the Garnet Lake Campground – right where Jenna grew up. Investigators couldn’t find any leads on the identity of the baby or anyone who witnessed a person abandoning an infant, according to a news release from the Michigan attorney general’s office. The case went cold, and the “Baby Garnet” case became a known murder mystery in Jenna’s small town for decades.  “Your DNA was a match,” Jenna says the detective on the phone told her. She was related to the dead infant from 1997.  Jenna was in shock. The detective sounded sure, Jenna said, but she wondered how he had even obtained her DNA.  About six months earlier, her friend had gotten a FamilyTreeDNA test for Christmas and Jenna decided to order her own. DNA from other Baby Garnet relatives led detectives to Jenna’s FamilyTreeDNA kit, according to court documents.  Jenna Gerwatowski, left, says the case was always a big mystery in her town. She had no idea the grandmother she'd never met, Nancy Gerwatowski, right, could be behind it. Jenna Rose Gerwatowski/Mackinac County Sheriff's Office  The detective said a woman from Identifinders International, a genetic genealogy investigation firm, would call her about her DNA to help with identifying closer relatives, according to Jenna.  According to court documents, detectives reopened the cold case in 2017 and then worked with a forensics company to extract DNA from Baby Garnet’s partial femur, before sending the results to Identifinders International.  Jenna explained the situation to her mother when she got home from work.  “It was just crazy,” Jenna said. “We were both sitting there like, I don’t even know who (the mother or father) could’ve been. We were both so confused and we’re like, it’s got to be somebody that we don’t know, you know, like a distant cousin or something.”  Jenna said her mother, Kara Gerwatowski, started to wonder whether the detective call was a scam.  Jenna’s grandfather had just been scammed by someone claiming to be a detective, so Kara told Jenna to be cautious about giving out personal information or passwords.  Misty Gillis, then a senior forensic genealogist and cold case liaison from Identifinders International, called Jenna that night, according to Jenna and court documents filed later in the case.  Jenna claims Gillis requested her FamilyTreeDNA password to be able to upload her DNA into a separate database. Jenna was concerned it was a scammer and refused to cooperate, according to court documents.  “I hung up the phone on her, not even thinking twice about it. And we went about our day. I was like, how weird. What a weird thing to scam people about,” Jenna said. “I wholeheartedly did not think that it was real.”  One week later, Jenna was working at the flower shop when she got a distressed call from her mother.  “She was like, ‘I really need you to come home. … It’s an emergency. Like, just please come as soon as you can,’” Jenna said.  Jenna rushed home thinking someone died. Her cousin was sitting with her mom at their round wooden kitchen table. Police had contacted her cousin, who works as a victim’s advocate in the county prosecutor’s office, to explain the Baby Garnet situation to Jenna. It turned out it wasn’t a scam.  “My mom had tears in her eyes,” she said. Jenna’s cousin had “just pure shock on her face. … You could hear a pin drop in there.”  Even though Jenna knew she had nothing to do with the Baby Garnet case, she was terrified police would think she was trying to hide something because of her refusal to speak with Gillis. She immediately called her.  An analysis of Jenna’s DNA kit showed she was the half-niece to Baby Garnet, according to court records.  On June 1, 2022, detectives spoke with her mother, Kara, who agreed to provide her DNA. Kara was the half-sister of Baby Garnet, according to court records.  “I feel like that is when, like, all of the puzzle pieces kind of started falling together for her,” Jenna said. “And she told detectives that, if it’s going to be anybody, it would be (her) mother.”  Kara, now 42, had not spoken with her mother, Nancy Gerwatowski, since she was 18 because they had a bad relationship, and Jenna had never met her grandmother. Regardless, both were shocked Nancy, who was living in Wyoming when police questioned her, would be the one behind their town mystery.  “I had grown up knowing about the case my whole life and then come to find out it was my grandma that did it?” Jenna said.  The Michigan attorney general’s office alleges Nancy “delivered the newborn alone at her Newberry home, during which Baby Garnet died due to asphyxiation, and that this death could have been prevented by medical intervention (Nancy) Gerwatowski did not seek.”  However, in a court filing, Nancy’s defense argues she unexpectedly gave birth while in the bathtub and the fetus “became trapped inside her birth canal.” She “attempted to pull the fetus out of her own body,” the filing says, but couldn’t deliver the fetus and lost consciousness “at some point in the delivery.” When she was finally able to deliver the fetus, it was dead, the filing says.  Her defense argues that Nancy, like the average person in the county in 1997, did not have access to a telephone or cell line, so she couldn’t call 911. While she concedes in her legal filings she placed the stillborn fetus in a bag and left the remains at the campground, her defense attorneys argue she had been in shock after having had no pain medication during the traumatic birth.  Nancy is charged with one count each of open murder, involuntary manslaughter, and concealing the death of an individual. Open murder carries a potential life sentence.  In a hearing on Thursday, Nancy’s defense argued that the case against her should be dropped in its entirety because the state cannot prove the baby was born alive. If the court allows the case to proceed, the defense argued, Nancy’s statements during police interrogation should be excluded because she was denied her right to counsel — a contention the state disputed. If the court does allow her statements to be a part of the trial, Nancy’s lawyers want her comments about considering an abortion and not seeking out prenatal care to be excluded, while the state argued the comments are relevant to possible motive.  Judge Brian D. Rahilly said he hopes to reach a decision on whether or not to drop the charges by next week or around the end of the year at the latest.  “It was a very hard time … very traumatizing and very nerve-wracking,” said Jenna. “I’ve never met this woman, so it was hard for me to even grasp that concept, but even harder for my mom because that was her mother.”",US,Baby Garnet cold case update: A DNA test helped solve a 1997 Michigan murder,,,,0.144,0.794,0.061,-0.9991
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-thursday-hnk/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  Marked shell casings from the assassination scene match the gun found on the suspect. His fingerprints match some key items investigators found nearby. And he was arrested this week – after going silent from his mom and friends for months – with a fake ID and a handwritten “claim of responsibility” referencing the crime site.  These details and others, shared by law enforcement and people who know suspect Luigi Mangione, have been mounting since last week’s daylight killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a busy sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of the investigation into Thompson’s killing, sources tell CNN.  A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN at least two of the warrants include the backpack found in Central Park and the burner phone found along the getaway route police believe Mangione took from the shooting scene. Investigators also searched the hostel where suspected killer Mangione stayed the night before the shooting and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  After a five-day, multi-state manhunt that leaned heavily on surveillance images and pleas for the public’s help, Mangione, 26, is now charged in the case with murder after a tip led to his arrest Monday at a McDonald’s nearly 200 miles from where the brazen homicide unfolded.  Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury in the case against Mangione, sources told ABC News.  Mangione was charged in a felony arrest warrant earlier this week. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  Blair County Judge David Consiglio scheduled a hearing in Pennsylvania on December 30 in response to Mangione’s petitions for writ of habeas corpus and imposition of bail, court documents from Thursday show.  Mangione was denied bail on Tuesday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania. The habeas corpus petition is a key factor in whether the suspect can be extradited to New York.  Mangione’s team was given two weeks from Tuesday to file the habeas corpus petition, which challenges Pennsylvania’s ability to prove that Mangione is the person the state of New York has issued the arrest warrant for, according to Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.  Mangione is also set to appear in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, court on December 23 for a preliminary hearing related to state charges.  Mangione’s lawyer has denied his client’s involvement in the December 4 killing and anticipates he will plead not guilty to the murder and other charges in New York, as well as to charges related to the 3D-printed gun and fake ID in Pennsylvania, where he was caught and is being held without bond.  Defense attorney Thomas Dickey on Wednesday also dismissed the ballistics and fingerprint evidence revealed publicly hours earlier, saying he wants to examine it himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”  Thomas Dickey, attorney for suspected shooter Luigi Mangione, speaks Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “As lawyers, we need to see it. We need to see: How did they collect it? How much of it? And then we would have our experts … take a look at that, and then we would challenge its admissibility and challenge the accuracy of those results.”  Still, New York’s governor expects a murder indictment “to be issued any day now, and the second that happens, I’m issuing a warrant for extradition.”  “It feels like the evidence is very compelling,” Gov. Kathy Hochul told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. “I trust the DA here in Manhattan to make sure that he puts forth an indictment that is going to be iron-clad.”  Meanwhile, Hochul is unimpressed by the folk hero status Mangione has attained on social media as the killing of Thompson – a husband and father of two – has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry.  Mangione appears to have been driven by anger against the industry and “corporate greed” as a whole, states a New York Police Department intelligence report that also warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  “That horrific attack occurred on our streets,” Hochul said Thursday. “And the people of our city deserve to have that sense of calm that this perpetrator has been caught, and he will be never seeing the late of day again if there is justice.”  “You cannot assassinate an individual on the streets of New York – not now, not ever.”  Neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said on Thursday.  Suspect hadn’t spoken to mother since July  Until he was found Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Mangione had gone quiet from at least a few people who appear to have been close with him. The scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, he had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  Mangione’s mother had reported him missing November 18 – two weeks before Thompson’s killing – a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. She called police in San Francisco, where she knew her son had been living, and told authorities she’d called his phone repeatedly to find the voicemail full and not taking any more messages.  Mangione’s mom had no reason to believe her son was a danger to himself or others, she told the San Francisco Police Department, but she hadn’t actually spoken with him since July 1, the official said. He had worked remotely at TrueCar, she also said, where the phone was disconnected and the offices closed, the official added.  It also doesn’t appear Mangione had posted anything since midsummer to social media, where posts addressed to his X account suggest some of his friends have been trying to get in touch with him.  In July, a user tweeted at Mangione, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding. In late November, just weeks before the shooting, another user posted at Mangione, “thinking of you and prayers everyday in your name. Know you are missed and loved.”  As Mangione entered a Pennsylvania courthouse this week, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, he yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Suspected shooter Luigi Mangione is led from the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “He’s irritated, agitated about what’s happening to him and what he’s being accused of,” Dickey told CNN of Mangione’s outburst and struggle with police.  “He never had any legal representation until he walked into that building yesterday. And I talked to him … look at the difference between when he went in and when he came out … now he has a spokesperson and someone that’s going to fight for him.”  Suspect linked to fingerprints and gun  Police in New York on Wednesday publicly revealed the first positive forensic match and direct physical evidence tying Mangione to Thompson’s killing, law enforcement officials told CNN.  “We got the gun in question back from Pennsylvania. It’s now at the NYPD crime lab,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “We were able to match that gun to the three shell casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of the homicide.”  A 3D-printed gun was in Mangione’s possession when he was arrested Monday, police have said.  The three 9 mm shell casings had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, one word per bullet, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Police have been looking into whether those words, which match the title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry, may point to a motive in the killing.  Authorities also had been probing DNA material and a partial fingerprint from a discarded Starbucks water bottle and an energy bar wrapper surveillance images showed the suspect buying about 30 minutes before the shooting. Mangione’s fingerprints were confirmed as a match, Tisch said  Along with the prints and ballistics, investigators have been examining writings police have said Mangione had upon arrest, including a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility.” It did not include specific threats but indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday.  In some writings, he referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny added. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  Investigators also are looking at the suspect’s writing in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.  It included to-do lists to facilitate a killing, as well as notes justifying those plans, the source said. In one notebook passage, Mangione wrote about the late Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber who justified a deadly bombing campaign as an effort to protect against the onslaught of technology and exploitation. Mangione had written about the Unabomber in online posts as well.  In a notebook passage, Mangione concludes using a bomb against his intended victim “could kill innocents” and shooting would be more targeted, musing what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/hannah-kobayashi-found-update-father/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  Hannah Kobayashi “has been found safe,” her family said Wednesday, more than a week after police declared her voluntarily missing amid fears she may have been abducted.  “We are incredibly relieved and grateful that Hannah has been found safe,” Kobayashi’s sister, Sydni, and mother, Brandi Yee, said. “This past month has been an unimaginable ordeal for our family, and we kindly ask for privacy as we take the time to heal and process everything we have been through.”  The statement was posted on X by the family’s lawyer, Sara Azari. The statement did not indicate where Kobayashi was or how the family determined she was safe.  The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement they are “happy to learn that Hannah has been found safe” and due to the new information “this has become a private matter and we will wrap up our investigation.”  The family had launched a GoFundMe that raised over $47,000 to help find Hannah. Donations have been turned off, and donors who would like a refund can submit a claim, the family said.  Hannah Kobayashi arrived at Los Angeles International Airport from Maui on November 8, but did not board her connecting flight to New York, her sister previously told CNN. The family last heard from the 30-year-old on November 11 after spending four days in Los Angeles at various locations, according to video footage and photos.

She was declared a missing person on November 15.  More than three weeks after she left Maui, Los Angeles police declared her as a voluntary missing person on December 2. Video surveillance from US Customs and Border Protection “clearly shows” Hannah Kobayashi crossing the US-Mexico border just after noon on November 12 at the San Ysidro port of entry, police said.  “To date the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a news conference. “She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her.”  Volunteers put up flyers of missing Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi outside Crypto.com Arena in Downtown Los Angeles. Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images/File  Before leaving Maui, investigators found Hannah Kobayashi had expressed a desire to disconnect from modern technology, police said.  Tragedy struck the family during their search for Hannah Kobayashi when her father Ryan Kobayashi, who had traveled from Hawaii to Los Angeles to help look for her, was found dead November 24 near the airport, having taken his own life, the family and authorities say.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/louisville-police-reform-breonna-taylor/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"Louisville, Kentucky AP —  The US Justice Department and the city of Louisville have reached an agreement to reform the city’s police force after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, officials said Thursday.  The consent decree, which must be approved by a judge, follows a federal investigation that found Louisville police have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the “historic content decree” will build upon and accelerate, this transformational police reform we have already begun in Louisville.” He noted that “significant improvements” have already been implemented since Taylor’s death in March 2020. That includes a city law banning the use of “no-knock” warrants.  The Justice Department report released in March 2023 said the Louisville police department “discriminates against Black people in its enforcement activities,” uses excessive force and conducts searches based on invalid warrants. It also said the department violates the rights of people engaged in protests.  “This conduct harmed community members and undermined public trust in law enforcement that is essential for public safety,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This consent decree marks a new day for Louisville.”  Once the consent decree is agreed upon, a federal officer will monitor the progress made by the city.  The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened 12 civil rights investigations into law enforcement agencies, but this is the first that has reached a consent decree. The Justice Department and the city of Springfield, Massachusetts announced an agreement in 2022 but the investigation into that police department was opened under President Donald Trump’s first administration.  City officials in Memphis have taken a different approach, pushing against the need for a Justice Department consent decree to enact reforms in light of a federal investigation launched after Tyre Nichols’ killing that found Memphis officers routinely use unwarranted force and disproportionately target Black people. Memphis officials have not ruled eventually agreeing to a consent decree, but have said the city can make changes more effectively without committing to a binding pact.  It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department’s priorities around civil rights.",US,"DOJ, Louisville reach deal after probe prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor",,,,0.054,0.79,0.156,0.9902
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  Weeks of mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey are prompting heightened security concerns – and mounting frustrations – from residents, military personnel and federal, state and local officials.  While the state’s governor says there’s no threat to public safety, other state officials and local mayors are alarmed.  “I’m legitimately concerned for what the hell is going on because nobody knows,” state Assemblyman Brian Bergen told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey after a briefing at state police headquarters on Wednesday.  “We are literally being invaded by drones. We have no idea who is doing it and where they’re coming from,” Pequannock Mayor Ryan Herb told the station after the briefing.  Law enforcement has not identified the origin or landing sites of the drones, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday. He added that the drones primarily operate at night, often displaying flashing lights, but they turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached.  According to Melham, the drones have eluded radar detection, possibly because they do not emit frequencies or possess evasion capabilities.  He also raised alarm over where some of the drones have been spotted.  “One of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey’s critical infrastructure,” Melham said.  The mayor of West Milford, Michele Dale, reported 60 drones hovering over local reservoirs.  Some members of Congress have speculated that a foreign entity may be involved in the drones, something the Pentagon rebuffed Wednesday.  The denial came hours after US Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, told Fox News the drones were from “a mothership” from Iran that is “off the East Coast of the United States of America.”  “There is not any truth to that,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.”  Meanwhile, US Northern Command, which oversees the Defense Department’s homeland security efforts, said in statement Wednesday that it had “conducted a deliberate analysis of the events” regarding the drone sightings but had not been asked “to assist with these events.”  A spokesperson for the US Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged an encounter by one of its assets with the drones.  “Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  The aircraft were not seen as an immediate threat and did not interfere with operations, Pinneo added.  CNN reached out to the Coast Guard but did not receive an immediate response.  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told WBGO on Wednesday the public should feel secure while acknowledging their fears.  “Based on everything we know, there is no public safety risks we’re aware of,” Murphy said.  “Is it frustrating to have no answers? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes,” the governor told the radio station.  The sightings began November 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. At times, large drones — some up to 6 feet in diameter — were seen nightly in New Jersey from dusk until 11 p.m., with sightings ranging from 4 to 180, according to state lawmakers who attended the briefing Wednesday.  The drones operate in a coordinated manner, turning off their lights to evade detection, complicating tracking efforts. They are not identified as hobbyist drones or linked to the Department of Homeland Security, State Assembly member Dawn Fantasia said on X.  The FBI is leading the investigation with the New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, while the US Coast Guard is assessing jurisdictional responses.  Federal agencies have ruled out any connections of local, state, or federal governments to the sightings.  Melham called for a temporary flight ban on all personnel and commercial drones in his video update, despite official advisories against such measures.  Concerns escalated after drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to military officials and state lawmakers. The sightings prompted the FAA to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.  Unnerved residents have described frequently seeing the drones hovering overhead, sometimes traveling in clusters.  While visiting family in New Jersey, travel content creator Katie Caf initially doubted reports of drones until she spotted several moving in a “zigzagging” pattern on Saturday. The 29-year-old noticed five potential drones, which she described as being the size of a bicycle. “They’re so weird looking and they’re much bigger than normal drones. I get why everyone is freaking out now … I think it’s kinda spooky.”  Fantasia said on X that the briefing occurred Wednesday at the New Jersey State Police headquarters and included descriptions of the aircraft’s movements and federal agencies’ response.  Though Murphy has said there is no known threat to the public, Fantasia and other local leaders have expressed doubt and are demanding more transparency into the investigation.  US Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, pushed for more information from federal investigators in a letter sent Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  “I recognize the need to maintain operational security of ongoing investigations and that this situation requires complex interagency coordination,” Booker wrote. “However, there is a growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state – from constituents and local officials alike – despite assurances that the drones pose no known threats to public safety.”  The FBI in Newark has asked the public to report any information related to the drones, including in several areas along the Raritan River.  “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI field office in Newark said December 3.  During a US Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday, Robert Wheeler, assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, called the phenomenon “concerning” but said “there is nothing that is known” that would lead him to identify a public safety risk.  CNN has sought more information from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and New Jersey State Police.  This story has been updated with additional information.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/university-of-mississippi-student-killing-mistrial/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"AP —  A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the case of Sheldon “Timothy” Herrington Jr. in the 2022 killing of Jimmie “Jay” Lee, a gay man who was prominent in the LGBTQ+ community at the University of Mississippi.  Jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict after over nine and a half hours of deliberation.  Lee’s body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead.  Herrington, 24, showed little emotion as he left the courtroom with his attorneys and several relatives. He remains free on bond and is still charged with capital murder, which Mississippi law defines as a killing committed along with another felony — in this case, kidnapping. Prosecutors had said they would not seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison if he is tried again and convicted.  Jurors on Wednesday were told they could also consider lesser charges of first-degree murder, punishable by life in prison; second-degree murder, 20 years to life; or manslaughter, up to 20 years.  University of Mississippi student Jimmie ""Jay"" Lee is seen in this undated image. Oxford Police Police Department  Circuit Judge Kelly Luther said he will consult with prosecutors and defense attorneys about setting another trial.  Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee, 20, was pursuing a master’s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.  Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, where the university is located and the trial was held.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee vanished. Investigators testified that they used warrants to obtain electronic records including explicit messages between social media accounts belonging to the two men and online searches conducted by Herrington, including one inquiring how long it takes to strangle someone.  Prosecutors said during closing arguments Wednesday that Herrington and Lee had a sexual encounter that ended badly and Lee left Herrington’s apartment. They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex. Prosecutors said Lee was killed after going back.  “Tim Herrington lived a lie — lived a lie to his family,” District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. “He lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.”  Herrington’s attorney, Kevin Horan, has said prosecutors cannot prove Lee is dead without having a body. He told jurors Wednesday that text messages showed Herrington did not lure Lee to his apartment.

Bruce Newman/Pool/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal/AP  “He’s the one that’s being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,” Horan said of Lee.  Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.  Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained explicit messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.  Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched “how long does it take to strangle someone” at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.  The final text message from Lee’s phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington’s apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee’s phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee’s car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.  On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.  Herrington’s relatives sat behind him in the courtroom, and Lee’s sat behind prosecutors. When Luther dismissed court after the mistrial, he instructed the two groups to leave separately.  Jurors were chosen from another county about 250 miles to the south. They heard eight days of arguments and testimony.  The judge twice urged jurors to continue deliberating when they said they were deadlocked. After the third such message, Luther declared the mistrial and thanked them for serving, adding: “I’ve asked a lot of you.”",US,Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee: Judge declares mistrial after jury deadlocks over killing of gay University of Mississippi student,,,,0.136,0.808,0.056,-0.9977
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/us/timeline-luigi-magione-ceo-shooting/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  As investigators work to piece together the possible motive and movements of 26-year-old Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione, suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, here’s what we know.  This timeline is based on information from law enforcement sources, official police releases, surveillance images and social media records.  Summer of 2024  Mangione had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  During the summer, Mangione appears to stop posting online, prompting worried messages from some of his friends.  In July, one user posts on X, tagging Mangione, saying, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding.  Mid-November  Mangione’s mother reports her son missing in San Francisco, law enforcement officials said.  Sunday, November 24  10:11 p.m. – Mangione arrives in New York at the Port Authority bus terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue via a bus that originated in Atlanta, then gets into a cab that takes him to the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, where he stays about half an hour.  There was an interaction while the suspect was checking in at the hostel, making casual conversation. ""At some point, he pulled his mask down and smiled at the at the clerk,"" said Joseph Kenny, NYPD chief of detectives. NYPD  11 p.m. – He takes another cab to a hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave. on the Upper West Side, identified as HI New York City Hostel in charging documents.  11:20 p.m. - Surveillance footage from the hostel shows him checking in and showing a driver’s license, according to the arrest warrant in the case. Records from the hostel show he provided a New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario on it, the warrant says.  Friday, November 29  Mangione checks out of the hostel.  “It’s not your traditional check in, check out. It’s the kind of thing where if you don’t show up at a certain time, they automatically just check you out,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. “We don’t believe that he went someplace else.

Wednesday, December 4  5:34 a.m. – Surveillance footage reviewed by law enforcement shows Mangione leaving the hostel, possibly by bike.  5:41 a.m. – He is seen wandering around the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown, on Sixth Avenue between West 53rd and 54th Streets, and goes back and forth for a bit before heading toward a Starbucks.  “We have him wandering around, walking in the vicinity of hotel, walking on 54th Street, walking back and forth,” Kenny said.  Around 6:17 a.m. – Images from Starbucks show him buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, according to a law enforcement official.

Gideon Platt, Stage Star Deli  6:30 a.m. – Around 6:30 a.m., surveillance video captures what appears to be the gunman on the phone.  Patrick Laborde  6:44 a.m. – Thompson, the victim, walks toward the Hilton after leaving his hotel across the street, police said.  The masked gunman is “lying in wait” outside the hotel as Thompson makes his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.  The gunman comes up behind Thompson and shoots him in the back, Kenny said. He then walks toward Thompson and continues to shoot, stopping to clear a gun jam before firing again.  Obtained by CNN  Investigators told CNN that after the shooting, the assailant crosses the street from the Hilton, flees northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street, and gets on an electric bike on 55th Street before heading north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.  Obtained by CNN  6:48 a.m. – Mangione is seen riding an electric bike into Central Park at 60th Street, according to Kenny.  NYPD  6:56 a.m. – He rides out of the park.  6:58 a.m. - He is seen on the bike at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue.  7:00 a.m. - He is no longer on the bike and is heading northbound on 86th Street.  7:04 a.m. - Mangione gets into a cab.  7:30 a.m. – He is seen near the George Washington Bridge and a Port Authority bus station off 178th Street.  Video shows the suspect entering the bus station.  “We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” Kenny said.  5-Day Manhunt  The suspect was in Pennsylvania for “several days” after the shooting in Manhattan, according to Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police.  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the suspect traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in Altoona, where he is arrested.  Monday, December 9  In a new post on social media, Pennsylvania State Police shared new images of Luigi Mangione sitting inside the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was captured on Monday. The images show Mangione eating what appears to be a hash brown inside the establishment. Pennsylvania State Police  9:14 a.m. - Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania are dispatched to a McDonald’s restaurant, after an employee tipped off police about someone resembling photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police.  9:58 a.m. - Mangione is taken into custody at the McDonald’s, where he presented police with a forged New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario as his identification – the same ID he presented at the hostel, according to the arrest warrant.  Mangione was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea in his first court appearance in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, later that day.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/us/wisconsin-kayaker-fake-death-in-custody/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"Green Lake, Wisconsin AP —  A Wisconsin man who faked his own drowning and left his wife and three children to go to Eastern Europe is in police custody, online records show.  Ryan Borgwardt, 45, was booked into the Green Lake County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system, a service that provides information to crime victims such as a person’s jail custody status. No charges were listed.  The Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday in a social media post that a news conference would be held Wednesday morning to update the Borgwardt case. The post said no further information would be provided until then.  A person answering the phone at the sheriff’s office Tuesday night declined to confirm whether Borgwardt was in custody. County jail officials didn’t immediately return a phone message Tuesday night.  Last month, Sheriff Mark Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on November 11 after disappearing for three months but that he hadn’t committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were “pulling at his heartstrings” to come home. He suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance.  Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of “personal matters,” the sheriff said. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it’s the deepest in Wisconsin.  After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane.  The sheriff said at the time that investigators were working to verify Borgwardt’s description of what happened.  The sheriff’s office has said the search for Borgwardt’s body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn’t expect the search to last more than two weeks.",US,"Ryan Borgwardt: Wisconsin kayaker who faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe is in custody, online records show",,,,0.06,0.933,0.007,-0.9398

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-administration-big-donors/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  Nearly three dozen of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks to serve in his incoming administration donated to his campaign or to the deep-pocketed outside groups that worked to elect him, a CNN analysis of federal campaign records shows.  They range from tech multibillionaire Elon Musk – who has emerged as the single largest, disclosed political donor of the 2024 presidential election – to others close to Trump tapped for key roles throughout government.  In all, eight of his Cabinet picks – led by Linda McMahon, the billionaire wrestling magnate Trump has selected to oversee the Education Department – and their spouses donated more than $37 million combined from their personal accounts to aid Trump, the review found, underscoring the proliferation of ultra-rich Americans now poised to shape US policy in the incoming second Trump administration.  (Two other Cabinet choices, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, transferred money from their campaign accounts to the pro-Trump effort.)  Musk has not been selected for a formal Cabinet job but is helping guide a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative and has played a pivotal role in the presidential transition – offering his views on job candidates, talking to world leaders and meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as he weighs how to downsize the federal government.  In all, the SpaceX and Tesla chief executive donated more than $277 million to federal elections this cycle, the lion’s share of which – more than $262 million – benefited Trump. Most of Musk’s pro-Trump dollars flowed to a super PAC that the world’s richest man created to help turn out voters on the Republican’s behalf in key swing states.  Outside of self-funded presidential candidates, no individual has donated more to shape federal contests in a single election cycle, said Brendan Glavin, research director of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes money in politics.  Trump’s donors “are not just getting these sort of plum ambassadorships on the side,” Glavin said. “Major donors are getting positions that affect policy.”  The CNN analysis researched the more than 90 people that Trump had announced for high-level positions in the administration through Tuesday, which marked five weeks since his election victory. More than 30 of them had donated to his campaign or to one of the leading Trump-aligned outside groups, the review of FEC records found.  “Millions of Americans fed up with failure in the White House and federal government joined President Trump in the movement to restore our nation’s greatness. Some who will work with President Trump are among those millions of people who supported the campaign and helped the President win a decisive electoral victory,” Brian Hughes, a Trump transition team spokesman, said in a statement in response to CNN’s inquiry about donors joining the administration.  The total donations from Trump’s current Cabinet picks marks a surge from Trump’s first term. Five members of his original Cabinet had donated nearly $8 million to his committees or to the major outside groups supporting him, a review of campaign reports shows.  Donations from McMahon, who served as Trump’s SBA administrator in his first White House term, accounted for more than 90% of that total in the 2016 election.  The sums spent to aid Trump in 2024 far exceed the donations that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet members contributed to help him win the White House in 2020, FEC records show.  A dozen members of Biden’s Cabinet reported donations to his campaign or major super PACs involved in the 2020 election, giving less than $100,000 in total.  Billionaires in the administration  Musk’s spending dwarfed that of other supporters.  McMahon was the largest donor among Trump’s Cabinet picks and the second most generous contributor, after Musk, among the administration members announced through Tuesday, the review found.  Most of the $21.2 million she donated went to Make American Great Again, Inc., the main Trump-affiliated super PAC that spent heavily on advertising to aid his campaign.  Other seven-figure donors among Trump’s Cabinet picks include Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick, whom Trump has tapped to serve as Commerce secretary; Scott Bessent, the hedge fund executive Trump has selected to oversee the Treasury Department; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, his choice to head the Small Business Administration.  Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher, also was a major donor, contributing more than $2 million to the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and Trump’s joint fundraising committee.  Sprecher is the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and was at Trump’s side when the president-elect rang the opening bell at the exchange Thursday.  In an email, Loeffler’s communication director Caitlin O’Dea said, “Senator Loeffler is proud to be one of President Trump’s strongest supporters for the same reason a historic landslide of Americans voted to put him back in the White House: he will restore American prosperity, security, and opportunity.”  The billionaire embrace marks a turnaround of sorts for Trump, who saw corporate America recoil from him after the violent January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And he has seen new support from tech leaders who are pushing for fewer regulations from the federal government.  The staggering sums spent by Musk in this year’s election helped Trump close the financial advantage of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who swiftly raised $1 billion after becoming her party’s standard-bearer in late July.  Super PACs face no limit on the size of donations they can receive or spend, but technically are not allowed coordinate their advertising decisions with the candidates they support.  However, a ruling this year by the FEC granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing efforts freed up Musk to guide a ground game for Trump.  “The campaign finance system is a joke,” said Fred Wertheimer, who heads the Democracy 21 watchdog group and is a longtime advocate for limits on money in politics. “Musk is the example now of how campaign finance laws have failed.”  He said he worries about government departments led by billionaires who have no “interest in doing the job that the agency was assigned.”  Musk did not respond to inquiries from CNN.  But Tom Davis, a former congressman from Virginia who chaired the House Republicans’ campaign arm for several years, argues “there is nothing inherently wrong about people who made a lot of money wanting to give back through government.”  “The fact that they have contributed shows a degree of loyalty,” he added.  Friends and family  Presidents often reward donors and allies with plum positions – often dispatching them to glamorous, low-conflict posts in Europe or the Caribbean.  Some of Trump’s early picks for ambassadorships follow that pattern and include billionaires who donated to his reelection effort. Among them: Arkansas investor Warren Stephens, named as the US’ envoy to the UK, and Charles Kushner, Trump’s choice for ambassador to France – one of several extended family members or close friends who has been chosen for diplomatic gigs.  Kushner, who donated $2 million to pro-Trump efforts and received a presidential pardon at the end of Trump’s first term, is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. Another donor, Tom Barrack, who oversaw the fundraising for Trump’s first inauguration, is his choice as ambassador to Turkey.  And incoming special envoy to the Middle East, real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff, is a longtime Trump friend and a partner in the cryptocurrency businesses that Trump launched with his sons earlier this year.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-abc-news-defamation-lawsuit-settle/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  ABC News and George Stephanopoulos have reached a settlement with Donald Trump in his defamation suit. The network will pay $15 million to a charity and will issue an apology.  The settlement was filed publicly Saturday and reveals ABC will pay $15 million as a charitable contribution to a “presidential foundation and museum to be established by or for the Plaintiff.”  The network will also pay $1 million in Trump’s attorneys’ fees.  Trump filed the lawsuit in Florida federal court earlier this year, arguing that Stephanopoulos and ABC News defamed him when the anchor said 10 times during a contentious on-air interview with South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace in March that a jury found Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll.  Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and that he defamed her when he denied her claim. Trump has denied all wrongdoing toward Carroll.  In 2023, a jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, though it did not find that Carroll proved he raped her. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million for batter and defamation. In January, Carroll was awarded an additional $83.3 million in damages for his defamatory statements disparaging her and denying her rape allegations.  The jury did not find that Carroll proved Trump had raped her. Instead, a judge concluded months later when dismissing Trump’s countersuit against Carroll that the claim Trump raped Carroll was “substantially true.” The judge wrote in August 2023 that Trump “raped” her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.  In the lawsuit filed against ABC News in March, Trump claimed that Stephanopoulos’ statements were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.”  The case was allowed to move forward in July, with the judge refusing to dismiss the lawsuit, writing that these definitions were different enough. He added that the case would turn on “whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury’s verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.”  This story is breaking and will be updated.",US,ABC News settles defamation suit with Trump for $15 million,,,,0.156,0.804,0.04,-0.9932
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/antony-blinken-jordan-syria/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"Aqaba, Jordan CNN —  The United States has had direct contact with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Syrian rebel group now in de-facto control of the country, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday.  The first public confirmation of direct interaction with the US-designated terrorist group, known as HTS, came at the conclusion of Blinken’s diplomatic sprint through the region spurred by the sudden collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  “Yes, we’ve been in contact with HTS and the other parties,” Blinken said at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan. Blinken did not give details on when the contact was made or at what level. There is no legal barrier to speaking with a designated terrorist group.  “We have pressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,” Blinken said, referencing the American journalist who was detained in Syria more than a decade ago. The US has redoubled its efforts to find him in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse.  The US also shared the principles expected of a new Syrian government, including that the rights of all Syrians should be respected, that the country must not become a base for terrorism, that humanitarian aid must be delivered, and that chemical weapons stockpiles should be secured and safely destroyed.  Those principles, circulated by the US in the days after Assad’s shocking ouster, were further agreed upon in a joint statement by the US and a coalition of other countries at an urgent ministerial meeting in Aqaba on Saturday. Blinken said the agreement “sends a unified message to the new interim authority and parties in Syria.”  Ahead of the Saturday ministerial meeting, Blinken met with key partners in Jordan, Turkey and Iraq to garner consensus around the principles.  “America and our partners have an important stake in helping the Syrian people chart this new path,” the top US diplomat said Saturday. “We know what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders — from mass displacement to terrorism.”  “We can’t underestimate the challenges of this moment and the weeks and months ahead,” he added.  Throughout his trip, Blinken sought to emphasize those stakes. Moving forward, the dynamics on the ground in the region could present significant complications, despite a consensus on the principles.  There was an intense spate of fighting in recent weeks in northern Syria between Turkish-backed forces and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which the US sees as a key partner in the fight to keep ISIS degraded.  A fragile truce between the two sides in Manbij appears to be holding, but the fighting forced the SDF to halt its anti-ISIS operations, according to its top commander.  “This is a moment of vulnerability in which ISIS will seek to regroup, taking the advantage of transition in Syria,” Blinken said Saturday, reemphasizing the importance of the SDF.  In meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Ankara, Blinken warned the US does not want to see any party take actions that would allow ISIS to regroup, including by distracting the SDF from its mission to keep the terrorist group degraded and its fighters imprisoned, a US official said. Blinken also emphasized that nobody should take actions that could jeopardize factions in Syria from potentially coming together in a unified government.  In Baghdad, Blinken asked Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to crack down on the powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and to prevent Iran from transiting weapons through Iraq to Shia militias in Syria, the US official said. Such militias have targeted US personnel and interests in the past.  The response to Israel’s actions in Syria has also emerged as point of division between the US and its Arab partners.  Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has pummeled Syria with strikes and sent Israeli troops to — and beyond — a “buffer zone” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria, in what the United Nations said would be a violation of a 1974 agreement. Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Qatar have condemned Israel’s seizure of the buffer zone, calling it an attempted land grab.  The US, however, has not condemned the move, with Blinken saying that they are talking with the Israeli government.  “The stated purpose of those actions from the Israelis is to try to make sure that equipment that’s been abandoned — military equipment that’s been abandoned by the Syrian army — doesn’t fall into the wrong hands: terrorists, extremists, etc.,” he said Thursday. “But … we’re already talking with Israel; we’re all talking to others about the way ahead.”  A US official said Friday that Blinken intends to make clear to his Arab counterparts that Israel told the US that the incursion is temporary — and that the US expects it to be. That policy could change, however, next month when the Trump administration takes office, this official conceded.

Pelosi, 84, is receiving “excellent care” from doctors and medical professionals, Ian Krager, the spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday.  The US military had medevaced the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. The medical center is a major military hospital that for years has treated US troops injured in combat.  “While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,” Krager said Friday.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-ban-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  TikTok has plans for another appeal as it faces a ban on January 19.  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected a temporary pause on the ban of TikTok, calling such a block “unwarranted” and paving the way for the Supreme Court to potentially decide the fate of the popular video-sharing app.  In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that required TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, to be sold to a non-Chinese company. The latest ruling follows last week’s decision by the same appeals court to uphold the law, citing national security concerns.  The Biden administration previously urged the appeals court not to issue a temporary block on the law, arguing that doing so might allow the company to wait months to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, effectively halting the law indefinitely.  “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said on December 6.  What will TikTok’s next appeal look like?  The Supreme Court could make a quick decision on the case. Both TikTok and the federal government previously asked the appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the January 19 ban.  But the Supreme Court, which has a six-justice conservative majority, seems likely to rule in favor of upholding the ban, Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN earlier this month.  “I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” Schiller said.  Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN earlier this month that the Supreme Court may decide not to review the case at all, in which case TikTok is out of luck.  Do you need to delete the app?  Not necessarily.  The Department of Justice said Wednesday that, if the ban takes effect, it would “not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok” for the app’s more than 170 million monthly users. But don’t expect any more updates from the app or the ability to download it, if the ban takes place.  Two leaders of the US House of Representatives’ committee on China sent a bipartisan letter to the CEOs of Apple and Google parent company Alphabet that said they should prepare to remove TikTok from their US app stores on January 19.  TikTok will also be unavailable on internet hosting platforms. The Justice Department warned users can expect the app to “eventually” be unworkable.  Can the ban be avoided?  There’s still some hope that TikTok could remain active in the United States, though ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell it.  The ban’s legislation leaves room for Biden to grant a one-time, 90-day extension if he determines a company has made progress toward a sale. He hasn’t suggested any plans to do so.  President-elect Donald Trump, who begins his term a day after the ban, could be on TikTok’s side. He said in July (in a video posted to the app) that he would “never ban TikTok” — although he did try to ban it during his first term.  There are a few options: Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, though experts say that’s unlikely to be successful. He could also direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month.",US,TikTok’s ban won’t be delayed.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-shop-ban/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  Aakaanksh Autade was iffy on TikTok Shop, TikTok’s in-app shopping feature, when it launched last year. Then the content creator grossed over $100,000 in sales when he hosted a live event on Black Friday and went from skeptic to believer.  Autade is known for sharing tech-related tips and tricks on his TikTok channel, “kaansanity.” He took to TikTok Live for the first time on Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend to promote gadgets like headphones and game consoles. “It was my first time going live, and to make $102,000 in 10 hours was just insane. I didn’t expect it at all,” he said.  Aakaanksh Autade (left) promoted gadgets like the Nintendo Switch via TikTok Live on Cyber Monday. Courtesy Aakaanksh Autade/kaansanity  TikTok Shop allows users to buy and sell products without leaving the app. The sales platform combines entertainment and retail, making it particularly popular among Gen Z buyers, and it continues to grow. It has over 500,000 sellers in the US, including brands like L’Oréal, PacSun and Scrub Daddy.  TikTok Shop raked in $100 million in single-day sales this Black Friday — that’s triple the number from 2023, according to the company. Over Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend alone, the shop saw a 165% increase in shoppers year-over-year, according to a statement by the company this month.  However, a US appeals court this month upheld a law that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 or face a US ban.  That ban could grind the sales platform’s progress to a halt — but creators who spoke to CNN say that they’re sticking with TikTok Shop anyway because they don’t think a ban will actually happen.  “I don’t think TikTok is going anywhere. I think they’re going to figure it out, and there’s so many people invested in TikTok,” Autade said. “It’s hard to ignore how much it means to its users.”  What makes TikTok Shop tick?  TikTok Shop provides a pipeline from discovery to purchase by letting users shop products featured in live videos, pinned on brand and influencer profiles, or tagged in content shown on their algorithm-driven For You page.  Even before the launch of its shopping feature, TikTok had already established a reputation as a place for users to find items to add to their wishlists. A study conducted in 2022 by marketing consulting firm Material Plus found that 61% of users purchased an item after seeing content about it on TikTok, helped by hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which has over 12 million posts.  Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and TikTok creator, said combining passive entertainment with a shopping function can tempt users to open their wallets.  “You’ve got all these people who are spending so much time just being (on TikTok) consuming and creating content,” she said. “When you mix in commerce with our favorite source of entertainment, then we’re going to spend all our money there.”  TikTok Shop’s reliance on user-generated content allows consumers to hear from voices they trust.  Lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk says TikTok Shop's main draw is its ability to let consumers see their favorite influencers use the products they promote in real time. Courtesy Carrie Berk  Social media strategist Keenya Kelly says that TikTok Shop is another avenue for content creators to make money on TikTok without having to leave the app. Courtesy Keenya Kelly  “If you see your favorite creator promoting a product on a live stream or a video, you’re more likely to buy it in that moment,” said Carrie Berk, a lifestyle content creator. The thinking among viewers, she said, is that “if a makeup influencer is promoting a product on TikTok Shop, if she says it’s good, then it must be good.”  TikTok users like Autade also say that the app’s focus on short-form videos gives it an edge over other social media platforms.  “When I click on a product and I can see hundreds or even thousands of people posting a video about that product authentically, that really helps,” he said. “On a different platform, I might just see some words, some reviews, some stars here and there,” but seeing the product in action is different.  Another component of TikTok Shop’s growth is its popularity with younger users. Some 62% of Gen Z consumers say that TikTok is their platform of choice when they need to look something up, beating out search engines like Google, according to a report by marketing technology company SOCi published this year.  “Gen Z as a whole has really chosen TikTok as their premier destination for content,” said Jen Jones, chief marketing officer of e-commerce platform Commercetools. “TikTok shop just seemed like a natural place for those dollars to be spent.”  What would a TikTok ban mean for other social media retail platforms?  Social media shopping is not a new phenomenon.  Ninety-two percent of retailers plan to invest more in social commerce this holiday season, according to a study by Commercetools published in October. The same study showed that Facebook Marketplace was the social commerce platform of choice for businesses, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok Shop and X.  In particular, Jones sees an opportunity for YouTube to fill in the space TikTok could leave behind if a ban comes into force.  She says that YouTube could potentially meet demand for the style of short-form videos popularized by TikTok through YouTube Shorts while capitalizing on its longer-form content.  In the past year alone, people watched over 30 billion hours of shopping-related content on YouTube, the company previously told CNN in an email. In 2023, it launched YouTube Shopping, allowing content creators to tag products from brands featured in their videos and earn commissions.  Experts say that if the TikTok ban happens, it will serve as a lesson for brands to not put all their eggs into one marketing basket.  The Shop tab of the TikTok app is seen on an iPhone on June 23 in Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images  “It’s just really important for companies to have a very diversified strategy when it comes to social shopping,” said Jones. “We know that social shopping is here to stay. You can’t get locked into just one platform.”  Kelly says the same advice applies to individual content creators who make money off their posts and videos, and recommends cultivating a following through more direct forms of outreach like email lists.  “We use social media to reach a group of people,” she said. “You need to pull those people off social media onto email so that you have control over your business.”  Still, Kelly says she sees no reason for content creators to be concerned over the court ruling that moves TikTok one step closer to a ban.  “I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, she said. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.”  Berk commands an audience of almost 4 million followers on TikTok and describes the social media platform as a big part of her livelihood, but she says she’s not worried by the prospect of a total ban next month.  “There has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical,” she said.  Autade still has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, but he told CNN that TikTok was his primary marketing avenue and the platform that has brought him the most success.  Even as the threat of a ban looms nearer, he says it’s still business as usual and plans to continue with a live event in January similar to the one he hosted on Black Friday.  “I’m still all-in on TikTok. I’m still living my day-to-day life, running my businesses, and everything’s pretty much the same until I hear otherwise,” Autade said.",US,TikTok Shop was going to be the next big thing.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked.",US,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,,,,0.021,0.948,0.031,0.2114
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/sony-stock-record/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  The last time Sony was worth this much on the stock market, Bill Clinton was president and the PlayStation 2 was about to debut on American store shelves.  It’s been a rough past two and a half decades for Sony, the 78-year-old company that invented the Walkman and the PlayStation and had long been an icon of consumer electronics. It largely missed the boat on the mobile phone revolution, and while the PlayStation has been profitable, production costs for other electronics have risen while demand has softened.  But as opportunities arise in streaming, Sony is trying to transition from being a legacy consumer electronics company to an original content and entertainment company.  The strategy is working: In the past three years, Sony’s stock (SONY) has started to break out of a decades-long slump. Sony’s stock price in Japan recently closed at the first record high since March 2000, signifying confidence in the company’s ability to evolve its game offerings and steer itself toward entertainment, Damian Thong, a research equity analyst at Macquarie, told CNN.  “If you went back 30 years ago, it was an electronics company, so best known as a seller of hardware,” Thong said. “But today, the company is primarily generating profits off of entertainment, which is games, music and (TV and movies).”  Less hardware, more content  Sony Group, Japan’s third largest company by market value, has turned itself around by innovating its games business beyond consoles and making acquisitions to expand its IP, Joost van Dreunen, an adjunct assistant professor at NYU Stern who teaches the business of video games, told CNN.  Sony acquired Anime powerhouse Crunchyroll in 2021, and it acquired American video game company Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion.  In addition to Sony Interactive Entertainment, which makes the PlayStation, the behemoth Sony Group also includes Sony Pictures, which produces films like the Spider-Man series, and Sony Music, which includes Columbia Records.  Sony is trying to unlock synergy across its subsidiary companies to produce original entertainment content for consumers, van Dreunen said.  Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal in the first season of ""The Last of Us."" Liane Hentscher/HBO  That strategy of leveraging its intellectual property across its brands became apparent at the 75th Emmy Awards in January, when the TV series “The Last of Us” won eight primetime awards. It was the first time a TV show adapted from a videogame earned major consideration at a Hollywood awards ceremony.  It was a momentous occasion for Sony, which first published “The Last of Us” as a videogame in 2013 before it was adapted to become a TV series released in 2023 on HBO and Max. (HBO and Max share ownership with CNN.)  Without a streaming network of its own, licensing its intellectual property and original content is part of Sony’s strategy to compete with streaming giants like Netflix, Disney and Amazon.  Robert Lawson, the chief communications officer for Sony Group, said in a statement that since 2018 when the company acquired EMI publishing, making Sony Music the world’s largest publisher of music, Sony has invested approximately 1.5 trillion yen into content IP across various entertainment businesses.  “Sony Group has shifted its corporate strategies towards strengthening its creation and entertainment assets,” Lawson said, noting the company is focusing on “new collaborations between Sony sister companies,” including leaning heavily into the anime genre.  In the last fiscal year ending March, Sony’s entertainment business, which includes music, movies and games, accounted for 60% of total revenue. That’s double from a decade ago, when the entertainment business accounted for just 30% of total revenue.  A long road to dominance  Doubling down on entertainment represents a departure from Sony’s origins.  Before there was Sony, there was Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, founded in 1946 by Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka. The company released Japan’s first-ever magnetic tape record in 1950. In 1958, the company changed its name to Sony Corporation.  In the 1960s, Sony established its business in the United States. For the next three decades, the Japanese company emerged as a household name in consumer electronics, producing iconic devices from the Trinitron color TV in 1968 to the Walkman cassette player in 1979 to the world’s first CD player in 1982, in addition to numerous cameras and video recorders.  Sony has also been involved with music since the 1960s through a joint venture with CBS that became Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Yet it’s largely been known for its electronics.

Aflo/Shutterstock  The 1990s were a high point for Sony as it broke into the world of gaming consoles. With the release of the PlayStation in 1994, Sony disrupted the arcade and gaming industry.  Since the 1990s, Sony has been a dominant player in the videogame console business with iterations of the PlayStation. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, which has consistently outsold its main competitors like Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Nintendo’s Switch, according to data from Ampere Analysis, an analytics firm for the games business.  Van Dreunen said that Sony is also looking to evolve in gaming beyond its console business, looking for new audiences and methods of distribution.  “We’re currently going through a softer period in gaming, and so it really raises the stakes for companies like, what’s next?” he said. “How do you as the dominant console maker continue to innovate and continue to grow your business?”  An original PlayStation is pictured at a display of various memorabilia in the lobby of the Sony headquarters building in central Tokyo on November 27, 2024. December 3 this year marked the 30th anniversary of the first release of Japan's Sony PlayStation, transforming the world of video games. Richard A. Brooks/AFP/Getty Images  A customer walks away after purchasing the new Sony Playstation PS5 in Seoul on November 12, 2020, after Sony launched the new console in select markets around the world. Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images  Thong said that Sony has been successful in becoming a profitable channel for third-party publishers to sell videogames.  Sony has tried to diversify its strategy toward gaming, including publishing a videogame called Helldivers 2 across PlayStation5 and also PC. Helldivers 2 was a hit for Sony and sold over 12 million copies within three months of its release, according to Anna Kerr, a research manager for games at Ampere Analytics.  “The games business is spreading out its IP,” NYU Stern’s van Dreunen said. “It’s looking for new ways to reach customers, to expand that customer reach.”  In November, Sony announced a 69% percent jump in net quarterly profit, driven in part by its game segment. The company has had consistently strong quarters this year, driven by profitability in its games.  The company is now in talks to acquire Kadokawa, a Japanese videogame powerhouse that produces the popular videogame “Elden Ring,” according to people familiar with the matter.  There have been some headwinds: Sony’s rollout of the “Concord” vieogame and Sony Pictures’ latest installment of the Spider-Man universe were largely flops among fans this year. However, they are trial and error runs, van Dreunen said, and manageable expenditures for a company that has denoted 1.8 trillion yen ($11 billion) for acquisitions and stock buybacks through March 2027.  In May, at Sony’s annual investor conference, Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida said that the company was embracing a “creative entertainment vision.”  Sony’s emergence as an entertainment company was not always certain, Thong said.  “Sony had some years of quite substantial pain, I would say,” Thong said. “And I think to their credit, they managed to weather and see through it.”  Bringing Sony IP to the big screen  Van Dreunen said in the past, there wasn’t as much demand for videogame adaptations for movie and TV. Yet “The Last of Us” showed that Sony had an opportunity to bring more Sony IP to the big screen.  Before “The Last of Us,” Sony also tried its hand at videogame adaptation with “Uncharted,” a 2022 movie featuring actor Tom Holland that was based on a video game franchise first published by Sony in 2007.

Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg/Getty Images  Additionally, Sony is planning to adapt videogame franchise “God of War,” which it first published in 2005, to the big screen next year, Kerr said.  Sony is still in the electronics business, Thong said, noting its image sensors business works with companies like Apple and it produces high-end cameras. However, it has shed its identity as a mass consumer electronics company.  In 2025, Sony intends to spin off its online banking and insurance units, further doubling down on its entertainment offerings.  Sony’s stock is up almost 18% in the past month, outpacing entertainment heavyweights like Disney and Netflix, and boosted from investors piling into the Nasdaq, which crossed 20,000 for the first time this week.",US,Sony hasn’t been this hot since it made the Walkman,,,,0.013,0.855,0.132,0.9996
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/business/unitedhealthcare-insurance-denials-change/index.html,CNN,left,Business,,"CNN —  In his first public response to the consumer outcry following the fatal shooting of one of his top executives, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said Friday that the US health system “is not perfect” and that coverage decisions “are not well understood.”  “We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people’s frustrations with it,” Witty wrote in a guest essay in the New York Times. “No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It’s a patchwork built over decades.”  Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.  “Together with employers, governments and others who pay for care, we need to improve how we explain what insurance covers and how decisions are made,” Witty wrote. “Behind each decision lies a comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety.”  Witty also praised UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was killed in midtown Manhattan last week, writing that Thompson “fought for preventive health and quality health outcomes rather than simply adding ever more tests and procedures.”  In a statement on Friday, UnitedHealthcare said “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company’s treatment of insurance claims” and that it “approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission,” noting that “around one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons.”  Will changes be made?  Thompson’s fatal shooting pushed Americans’ dissatisfaction with their health insurance into the spotlight. Many have made their frustrations abundantly clear on social media.  Journalists have also chronicled insurers’ efforts to twist the system to their benefit. STAT, a news site that focuses on health care, has published a series of investigative stories on UnitedHealth, including articles on how the nation’s largest health insurer uses a computer algorithm to cut off rehabilitation care for Medicare enrollees, limiting clinical case managers’ discretion.  Whether the public outcry prompts UnitedHealthcare and other insurers to adjust their practices — particularly the much-maligned denials of treatment and claims — or pushes lawmakers to force the industry to make changes remains to be seen. It depends, in part, on whether patients continue making their voices heard, experts say.  Angry consumers have had success in overhauling the health insurance industry in the past. They railed against the restrictions of health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, in the 1990s, as captured in the 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” That helped spur insurers to offer more preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, which have fewer constraints but are more costly.  Any shifts in the nation’s complex health care system, however, will not come easily, nor quickly, experts say. There are many players involved, each of which has its own patient care concerns, financial interests and lobbying dollars to influence lawmakers.  UnitedHealthcare’s mission  While many patients and their advocates argue that insurers deny care to pad their profits, the industry maintains that it is protecting consumers from high prices and unnecessary care.  Soon after Thompson’s murder, Witty vowed in an internal message to employees to continue the insurer’s mission of helping “the system improve.”  “Our role is a critical role, and we make sure that care is safe, appropriate, and it’s delivered when people need it,” said Witty in a video message obtained by CNN. “And we guard against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex and ultimately unsustainable. So we’re going to continue to make that case.”  “What we know to be true is that the health system needs a company like UnitedHealth Group,” he continued.  Asked Thursday whether it will make any changes in response to consumers’ public complaints, UnitedHealthcare referred CNN to Witty’s video. Other major insurers either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment, but a leading industry association said that hospitals, providers and employers all have “a direct impact on the cost and accessibility of medical services.”  “In the fragmented and heavily regulated health care system, health plans, providers and drugmakers share a responsibility to make high-quality care as affordable as possible and easier to navigate for the people we collectively serve,” AHIP, the trade group, said in a statement. “Health plans are working to protect patients from the full impact of rising costs while connecting them to care that is safe, evidence-based and coordinated.”  But the recent events may prompt insurers to investigate their practices and make some changes, Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in an email to CNN. This is especially likely if they see risks to their businesses, such as if employers threaten to leave because coverage decisions are too onerous for their workers.  On the flip side, “the main reason to not change their practices is to maintain their profitability while also keeping costs reasonable in a broad sense for their clients and end users,” Utterback wrote.  Video Ad Feedback Scott Galloway says online rage directed at health care CEOs is directed at the wrong people. Hear why. 01:43 - Source: CNN  The HMO backlash  Though former President Bill Clinton failed to reform health care in the early 1990s, his administration’s efforts spurred increased concerns over the cost of care. That cued the growth of the HMO model, which allowed policyholders to see only certain doctors and required referrals from primary care physicians to see specialists and get certain tests and procedures. But HMOs also typically featured low premiums, low or no co-pays and no deductibles.  Policyholders rebelled because they felt they couldn’t access the care they needed, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.  Their angst was captured in extensive media coverage and in the 1997 film “As Good As It Gets,” when a young boy’s mother (played by Helen Hunt) tells a doctor (played by Harold Ramis) that her insurer would not cover an allergy test for her son’s asthma.  “F**king HMO, bastard pieces of sh*t,” Hunt says, before apologizing.  “That’s ok. Actually, I think that’s their technical name,” Ramis replies.  Many states responded to the complaints by passing patients’ bills of rights that limited HMO cost-control practices in state-regulated plans. Employers, who were hearing from angry workers, began shifting to PPOs, which generally provide coverage for a wider range of doctors but have much higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. PPOs have now largely eclipsed the managed care model.  But as health care costs continue to skyrocket, PPOs are instituting practices that resemble those of HMOs, particularly requiring approval of care in advance, known as prior authorization, Levitt said.  “If you think health care costs are rough now, imagine them without constraints,” said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+, a health care consulting group, and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.  Health insurers, however, do at times backtrack when faced with intense blowback. Earlier this month, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield halted its plan to limit the amount of time it would cover anesthesia used in surgeries and procedures after criticism from doctors and politicians. The policy was designed to reduce overbilling and make care more affordable, the insurer had said.  Efforts in Congress  Congress has tried for years to improve access to care and curtail costs, which are far higher in the US than in its peers even though it ranks last on key health measures. Lawmakers have held hearings and introduced bills, but there haven’t been comprehensive reforms enacted since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 — aside from several significant Medicare drug cost provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.  An effort to improve the prior authorization process in Medicare Advantage plans failed to advance in the Senate in 2022 after the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost about $16 billion over a decade.  However, there is now more bipartisan appetite on Capitol Hill to enact reforms, said Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive and vocal critic of the health care industry. Lawmakers reintroduced the prior authorization bill, which now comes with a zero cost estimate, and released a framework to establish so-called site-neutral payments in Medicare, under which Medicare would pay the same rate for a service provided in a hospital outpatient department, an ambulatory surgical center or physician’s office.  Plus, lawmakers are looking at reforms to the pharmacy benefit manager industry, which serves as a middleman between health insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers.  Republicans, who will control Congress starting in January, will be looking for cost savings to offset extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Whitlock said. That could push them to pass measures that would save the government money, such as site-neutral payments.  Meanwhile, the murder of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO will remain in the news as the case against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, winds its way through the court system. That will keep public frustration with health insurers in the spotlight – and could help advance legislation on Capitol Hill, Potter said.  “It will be a years long fight, but it’s going to happen,” he said. “Some kind of reform is inevitable.”",US,UnitedHealth Group CEO: America’s health system is poorly designed,,,,0.082,0.791,0.127,0.9982

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/us/drone-sightings-new-jersey-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"New York CNN —  Federal agencies are facing intense pressure to give the public more details on unexplained drone sightings in the New York City metropolitan area and beyond that have been going on for weeks over residential neighborhoods as well as restricted sites and critical infrastructure.  On Saturday, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey posted on X about the “growing number of drone sightings” there, making her state the latest to report such sightings, joining New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.  Federal officials have sought to calm the concerns about the sightings, but without giving further details about what they might be. They say there’s no evidence of a public safety threat, and many of the reported sightings are cases of mistaken identity.  “The bottom line is this: They’re not providing enough information to the public, and the public is concerned,” US Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Friday. “Believe me, I’m hearing from my constituents about this all the time, and I think it’s time for them to immediately get out there and brief.”  A drone sighting prompted the temporary closure of runways at New York’s Stewart International Airport on Friday night, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the Orange County airport about 70 miles north of New York City.  There were no impacts to the airport’s flight operations during the closure, which lasted about an hour, according to the Port Authority, which was alerted to the sighting by the Federal Aviation Administration.  “This has gone too far,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement Saturday, adding that last month she “directed the New York State Intelligence Center to actively investigate drone sightings and coordinate with federal law enforcement to address this issue.”  Earlier Friday, New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis called the response to the sightings “outrageous,” saying there are “drones and unmanned aerial systems flying above us and our government is not telling us who’s operating them and for what purpose?”  Malliotakis joined Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella in demanding answers.  Fossella said the drones, often seen flying at night, have been spotted hovering over critical infrastructures including Port Liberty New York near the Goethals Bridge, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and Fort Wadsworth, one of the oldest military installations in the country.  Representatives of the federal agencies investigating the drones who have briefed local officials behind closed doors said the drones sometimes appear to fly in a coordinated pattern and can sometimes be in flight for up to six hours, according to Montvale, New Jersey, Mayor Mike Ghassali.  And though federal officials have said there is no evidence the drone sightings pose a public safety threat, Belleville, New Jersey, Mayor Michael Melham has said he has received guidance police should call the county bomb squad if they encounter a downed drone.  In addition, local fire departments should wear hazmat suits when they respond, Melham said, saying the information was shared by his Office of Emergency Management following recent state-level meetings.  “We just don’t know what these things are, so we are being cautious,” Melham said.  Skepticism over government response  One New Jersey lawmaker is accusing federal officials of lying about the presence and purpose of the mysterious drones.  “They’re lying. That’s the long and the short of it,” Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson said in an interview Saturday with CNN’s Victor Blackwell.  Like several other officials and lawmakers, Peterson said he’s personally seen drones hovering near his rural New Jersey home, where he said the absence of street lights and nearby flight paths allows for clear visibility.  Peterson referenced the government’s response to the Chinese spy balloon that traversed over parts of the United States in 2023 to illustrate his point that the government is either embarrassed or unwilling to disclose the truth about the mystery drones due to security concerns.  “Why would you lie? Either because the reason that this is happening is incredibly embarrassing to the administration or it’s an incredibly high security risk for the country and they don’t want to tell us,” he said.  President-elect Donald Trump, meanwhile, has called on the Biden administration to either release any information it has about the mysterious sightings or shoot the drones out of the sky.  “Mystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government’s knowledge. I don’t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!! DJT,” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Friday his agency knows of “no threat or of any nefarious activity” related to the sightings.  Mayorkas pledged to be transparent “if we learn of any cause for concern.”  Officials are currently prioritizing the use of sophisticated radio frequency technology that can geolocate the operator of a drone, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.  There are multiple technical capabilities authorities can use to try and “defeat” a drone, including jamming a signal, disconnecting it from the operator or remotely “hijack” a drone but every option can pose numerous risks, the source said.  “Blowing it out of the sky is the last resort,” the source said, noting the option is always on the table if an aircraft presents a threat.  Federal and state officials said using offensive techniques to bring down the drones poses an unnecessary risk to people on the ground and legal challenges, especially as they have not been deemed threatening, the source said.  New Jersey’s Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has formally requested additional resources from the Biden administration to better address the ongoing situation.  “While I am sincerely grateful for your administration’s leadership in addressing this concerning issue, it has become apparent that more resources are needed to fully understand what is behind this activity,” Murphy said in a letter dated Thursday.  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.  Murphy’s concerns come as Naval Weapons Station Earle, a US Navy base south of Middletown, New Jersey, acknowledged Friday it had spotted “several instances of unidentified drones entering the airspace” above the facility despite no direct threats being identified.  “The base remains prepared to respond to any potential risks, leveraging robust security measures and advanced detection capabilities,” station spokesperson Bill Addison said in an email to CNN, adding there are airspace restrictions above the station.  The energy company PSEG on Saturday said it has “contacted the appropriate authorities” about reports of drones flying over its Salem and Hope Creek nuclear power plants in New Jersey.  Democratic Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey posted videos to his X account showing what appeared to be a cluster of drones over the Round Valley Reservoir Thursday night.  “This has gone on for weeks,” Kim wrote. “It’s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren’t able to track these devices to determine origin and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and counter measures.”  Last night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here’s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn — Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024  Morris County, about 30 miles west of New York City, issued a statement calling for “the federal government to marshal all federal resources at its disposal, including the military, to end the unauthorized flight of drones over our county and other parts of New Jersey.”  “Morris County and our communities have deployed considerable resources daily since the first drones were spotted,” the statement continued.  The Somerset County Sheriff’s Office similarly said in a Facebook post they had “increased vigilance” at sensitive locations and “are analyzing data and information on a daily basis.”  New York State Police said Friday afternoon in a post on X they had received “numerous reports of drone sightings over the past 24 hours” and they were investigating the reports. “We have no evidence at this time that any of the reported sightings pose a public safety threat,” reads the post.  Connecticut State Police announced Friday they have deployed a drone detection system to assist in investigative efforts into unauthorized drone sightings reported over Fairfield County.  “It’s very unsettling to public safety and security, both here in Fairfield and elsewhere,” Republican state Sen. Tony Hwang said in a statement Friday.  “What we have is a lack of information at all levels of government. It’s really a breakdown of communication. Without that vital communication, you lose the public’s confidence, you get speculation and you get fear,” he said.  And in Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro said his administration is “aware of” the reported drone sightings and is taking them seriously. The Democratic governor said Friday evening he directed the Pennsylvania State Police to look further into the sightings, and police will be flying helicopters to try to “determine where these drones are originating from and what the purpose of these drones are.”  White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby, in a press briefing Thursday, said there was “no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus.”  Kirby added many of “the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully.”  Mayorkas echoed Kirby’s explanation Friday, telling CNN some reported drone sightings were cases of “mistaken identity.”  Addressing calls to shoot down unidentified drones, he said, “It’s not as though anyone can just take down a drone in the sky. That in and of itself would be dangerous.”  Mayorkas added he has been in communication with New Jersey’s governor daily.  Congress briefed on drone sightings  Officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI briefed top committees in the House and Senate as well as a delegation of New Jersey lawmakers on the reported drone sightings, a source familiar with the situation tells CNN. The source said while there have been eyewitness reports of what appear to be drones over New Jersey, agency officials stressed in meetings Thursday many videos on social media appear to be civilian airplanes or helicopters.  “I don’t believe with all of these sightings, none of them are drones,” Gottheimer said, adding, “You can’t have the Wild West of drones out there,” with unmanned aircraft threatening infrastructure.  The New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness said there was “an active federal investigation” into the drone sightings, but elected officials want to hear more.  “We should be doing smart intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” US Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who sits on the Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said Thursday. “They should be shot down, if necessary, because they’re flying over sensitive areas.”  Residents in New York’s Rockland County reported drone sightings starting as early as November.  County Executive Ed Day sent a letter to President Joe Biden Friday seeking answers and urging his administration, along with the FAA and FBI, to investigate and provide clarity on the matter.  “The fact that this issue has persisted for weeks without clear answers is completely unacceptable — not just to the people of Rockland County, but to communities across the nation,” Day said in the letter. “It’s time for the Federal government to step up, take responsibility, and provide the answers we all deserve.”  Malliotakis said the situation “is creating havoc, people are confused, they’re concerned, they have anxiety, they don’t know what’s going on.”  No foreign involvement suspected by feds  The US intelligence community and federal law enforcement do not suspect foreign involvement in the drone sightings across New Jersey, security officials told members of Congress Thursday at one private briefing.  Key lawmakers assigned to congressional national security committees were told investigators do not currently believe the sightings involved an overseas connection, the use of foreign drones, nor an operator on the ground connected to a foreign government, according to a source familiar with the briefing conducted by representatives from the FBI, FAA and the Department of Homeland Security.  Officials said sighted drones have been observed with FAA-required anticollision lights and are not believed to have entered any restricted airspaces, according to the source.  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, New Jersey, on Dec. 5. Brian Glenn/TMX/AP  While authorities have not yet identified the origin of the mysterious drone flights, the source said an active FBI investigation remains underway to identify the person or persons operating them, and to determine whether any criminal violations of law have occurred.  Some of the more recent drone operations may be from copycats trying to play on people’s worries as the sightings get more news coverage, former FBI supervisory special agent Tom Adams told CNN. He said there are often innocent explanations, as well.  “I can tell you from my firsthand experience conducting operations for the FBI, as well as investigations into the suspected sighting of drones at critical infrastructure, it was fairly common for planets, crewed aircraft and even low Earth orbit satellites to be misidentified as drones at night,” Adams said.  Drones – unmanned aerial vehicles – are widely owned across the US. A total of 791,597 drones are registered with the FAA, split almost evenly between commercial drones and recreational drones.  Although the drones often display flashing lights, they frequently turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday.  The FAA issued temporary flight restrictions over the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster after drones were spotted in those areas, one week after the FAA received its first report of an unauthorized drone operation in the New York metro area on November 18.  “Until you know the origin and what these drones’ intent is, how can you tell me there’s no imminent threat?” Mayor Tony Perry of Middletown, New Jersey, told CNN Thursday.  Feds rarely coordinate drone info with locals  The sense that local officials are being left in the dark is partially a result of outdated laws keeping regulation of the skies entirely in federal hands, according to the chief executive of a company tracking unauthorized drone flights.  “The laws that regulate aircraft are not built to empower police to deal with the drones,” Axon CEO Rick Smith told CNN News Central Friday, “so if your local state fair has a drone coming towards it that police believe might be dangerous, right now there’s nothing they can do about it.”  Hochul, the Democratic New York governor, called on Congress to pass the Counter-UAS Authority Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act, which she said would give state and local authorities more power in dealing with unmanned aircraft systems and strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones.  The governor said that until these “powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden Administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  FAA regulations allow operators of recreational drones to fly up to 400 feet above the ground in airspace not controlled by FAA air traffic controllers. The FAA does grant waivers on a case-by-case basis to those wanting to operate drones in more congested airspace or at higher altitudes.  Giving local law enforcement more authority over drones is under consideration, Smith said, because traditional aircraft tracking technology is ineffective for vehicles hovering only a few hundred feet off the ground.  “The same radar and tracking system you use for a 747 just doesn’t work,” said Smith.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process with the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items which may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  FBI: San Francisco police recognized suspect  On Friday, the FBI told CNN they received a tip from the San Francisco Police Department, saying an officer with the department’s Special Victims Unit had recognized Mangione as a possible suspect on December 5 after seeing the surveillance photos of the suspect’s unmasked face.  The San Francisco Chronicle first reported on the tip Thursday.  Chronicle reporter Megan Cassidy told CNN’s John Berman her team reported “a few days ago” on the existence of a missing persons report in San Francisco for Mangione.  “Apparently, there was somebody at SFPD that was looking into the missing persons case, and after the shooting of Brian Thompson, recognized this person and called in this tip, or emailed this tip, to the FBI,” Cassidy said.  The FBI then sent the tip to New York investigators during the manhunt, the agency told CNN.  CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explained on Friday’s “AC360” how the tip ultimately made its way to the FBI in New York and the NYPD.  “This tip comes from, I think, a victim witness specialist in the San Francisco Police Department who had that missing persons case somewhere in front of them and looked at that face and says, ‘Gee, that could be the guy that is on these FBI posters all over town,’ so SFPD sends that to San Francisco FBI,” Miller said.  “San Francisco FBI says, ‘that’s a New York office case,’” he added.  Miller explained the FBI’s New York office likely sent the information to a violent crimes squad composed of a mix of FBI agents and NYPD officers.  “They look at it and they do a workup on the name, checking, you know, any indicators that guy’s been in New York, and then they send it over to NYPD,” Miller said.  By Sunday, the tip joined 200 viable leads being examined by authorities, according to Miller.  “Then Monday morning, at 9:15 in the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, another tip leads to the capture,” he said. “So you see, these leads are piling up, being tasked out and being worked, and this was in that pile coming up because it was a viable lead. It’s just that destiny took a hand quicker.”  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.",US,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,,,,0.13,0.828,0.042,-0.9995

CNN —  I’m not much of a hugger. Sure, I’ll bust out the warm fuzzies for relatives around the holidays but I’m not like, say, my best friend, who prefers her hugs to produce the bone-liquifying pressure of an industrial vise. My husband loves to tell the story of our first date, when he approached me with open arms and I maneuvered him into a firm, businesslike handshake. Touch is just not my love language! And if you’re also not a hugger, the holidays are a gauntlet of outstretched arms and sweatered bosoms and unfamiliar colognes. We’ll make it through together! I recently watched some interviews with the lead actresses of the new “Wicked” film (which is sooo so good), and each tends to clutch the other’s single beautifully taloned finger when things get deep.

The Friendship Queen Diaries  It’s like something out of a movie: Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in 1996. Now, she’s a queen in Ghana. Despite her challenging youth, Johnson made sure she and her daughter were well-traveled, and after discovering she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, she founded a travel company to organize trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Her work attracted the attention of the Dakpema, a governing body in northern Ghana. She was blown away when they asked her to accept the title of “Zosimli Naa,” or “Friendship Queen.” The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the centuries-old Dagbon Kingdom, which comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in the city of Tamale, where she now lives. “We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.  CNN  2. Fabric of rebirth  The iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is finally open to the public again after a devastating fire damaged it five years ago. As part of this rebirth, fashion designer and artist Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was asked to create new vestments, or special service garments, for the cathedral’s clergy. Vestments are an important part of a church’s identity and de Castelbajac said the theme for the new look was “noble simplicity.” The designer drew inspiration from Notre Dame’s stained glass and blonde stone, creating a look that he said speaks to tradition and innovation; old and new. The vision was “radiant with color, radiant of hope, radiant of faith,” de Castelbajac told CNN. You can see details of the vestments in the photo above, and learn more about de Castelbajac’s process in this video.  CNN  3. Music on the brain  If you’ve ever shared your life with someone with dementia or another progressive neurological disease, you know music can be magic. Toronto-based company LUCID is combining facial mapping software, artificial intelligence, and music to create a therapy for older patients dealing with health challenges like Alzheimer’s, dementia and even depression and anxiety. The treatment involves measuring how a person’s brain reacts to music and combining that with facial mapping and artificial intelligence. Using this data, the technology can create specific playlists that hopefully can alleviate stress, restlessness, confusion and emotional discomfort in dementia patients.  Natalia Botero-Acosta  4. I would swim 500 miles  This whale puts The Proclaimers to shame! A male humpback whale has completed an extraordinary record-breaking migration, swimming more than 8,000 miles from South America to Africa. The humpback was first spotted off the coast of Colombia in 2013 and seen again a few years later not far from its original location. But in 2022, the whale was unexpectedly detected in the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar, off the coast of East Africa. The typical migration route for humpback whales can approach 5,000 miles in a single direction, making this one’s journey close to two times that of most whales. The discovery also marks the first documentation of an adult male humpback traveling between the Pacific and Indian oceans.  Video Ad Feedback This Saudi dish transports you to the desert 02:31 - Source: CNN  5. The power of good food  Hadeel Al Motawa knows that food can be so much more than simple sustenance. She co-founded the award-winning restaurant Takya, located in the 600-year-old historic center of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. Though the food has all the artfully prepared aura of a high-class restaurant, the menu is inspired by the traditional home cooking Al Motawa grew up with, and by her travels around Saudi Arabia and abroad. After seeing the deep connection between food and culture, Al Motawa wanted to “bring that same connection back home, to create a space where people could rediscover the beauty of Saudi cuisine.” Saudi Arabia itself is a country of great geographical, and thus culinary, diversity. For example, the Eastern Province is known for its seafood, such as Muhammar, a fried fish dish made with rice and sugar that was traditionally popular among sailors. In the country’s northern region, where temperatures are cooler and may drop below freezing during winter, traditional recipes focus on grains and meat, like the popular jareesh, a lamb stew made with wheat and yogurt.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/crystal-mangum-duke-lacrosse-allegations/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"CNN —  More than 18 years after accusing three former Duke University lacrosse players of raping her, a falsified account she shared in graphic detail, Crystal Mangum has admitted she lied about the encounter.  In an interview on a web show published Wednesday, Mangum apologized to the men and said her relationship with God has made her understand why she fabricated the story. Mangum is serving time in prison on a second-degree murder conviction for killing her boyfriend.  The timeline of the North Carolina case begins in 2006, when Mangum said she was trapped inside a bathroom, sexually assaulted and raped by David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann at a team party where she was performing as an exotic dancer. The men were arrested following her allegations.  “I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn’t, and that was wrong. And I betrayed the trust of a lot of other people who believed in me,” Mangum said on Katerena DePasquale’s show, “Let’s Talk with Kat.” “I made up a story that wasn’t true because I wanted validation from people and not from God.”  David Evans, left, Collin Finnerty, center, and Reade Seligmann, right, look on during a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2007. Chuck Burton/AP/File  For more than a year, the school and the lacrosse players were thrust into a media frenzy, subjected to intense public scrutiny and damaging allegations of sexual assault that were ultimately dropped.  After Mangum’s confession, Duke told CNN on Friday it would not comment. The former players did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.  Here’s how the events unfolded.  A timeline of the events  • March 13, 2006: Mangum is hired as a dancer for a private party held by members of the Duke men’s lacrosse team. It takes place at a house on North Buchanan Boulevard in Durham. Mangum later accuses several players of raping her during the party early on March 14.  • March 28, 2006: Duke President Richard Brodhead suspends team play for the men’s lacrosse team, a move widely criticized as premature since no formal charges had been made yet. Media attention intensifies, with early reports painting a picture of privileged, White lacrosse players being accused by a Black woman. The case becomes a flashpoint for issues of race, class and privilege, according to the Washington Post.  • March 28-30, 2006: DNA tests on Mangum’s body fail to link any of the lacrosse players to the scene, according to a disciplinary order against prosecutor Mike Nifong by the North Carolina State Bar, but Nifong insists on moving forward with the case. Skepticism about the case begins to mount.  • April 18, 2006: Nifong formally charges Seligmann and Finnerty with rape, according to the disciplinary order. The charges are based largely on Mangum’s testimony, as forensic evidence was either inconclusive or absent.  • May 15, 2006: Nifong formally charges Evans with rape, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 5, 2006: Duke announces the lacrosse team is reinstated to play in the following fall, but public sentiment has already soured.  • December 28, 2006: Nifong is accused of withholding evidence and making misleading statements to the press, leading to an investigation by the state bar, according to the disciplinary order.  • April 11, 2007: Roy Cooper – then the state’s Attorney General and now its governor – announces “there is insufficient evidence to proceed on any of the charges” in a statement shared by Duke Athletics. The charges are dropped.  “We believe that these cases were the result of a tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations,” Cooper said. “Based on the significant inconsistencies between the evidence and the various accounts given by the accusing witness, we believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges.”  • June 16, 2007: Nifong loses his law license following disciplinary hearings about his handling of the case, including accusations of ethical misconduct and withholding evidence. His disbarment is finalized by the state bar in July, according to the disciplinary order.  • June 18, 2007: Duke announces that it has settled with the three lacrosse players, agreeing to pay a confidential settlement.  “It is impossible to fully describe what we, our families and team endured. As we said from day one, we are innocent,” Evans, Finnerty and Seligmann said in a statement. “But it took three hundred and ninety-four days, and the intervention of the North Carolina Attorney General, before our innocence was formally declared.”  • October 5, 2007: The three players file a civil lawsuit against the city of Durham, Nifong and other individuals, according to court documents. Durham later settles the lawsuit in part with a one-time grant of $50,000 to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.  • April 3, 2011: Mangum is charged with stabbing her boyfriend, leading to a lengthy criminal trial, and is convicted of second-degree murder in 2013.  ‘I hope they can forgive me’  Mangum has spent 11 years in prison, which she is getting through by reading the Bible and finding humor in her thoughts, she said in her interview with “Let’s Talk with Kat.”  She wishes she could help children who were sexually abused, she told DePasquale. When asked if she could describe her experience in prison in one word, she says: “Growth.”  Before becoming an exotic dancer, she studied psychology at North Carolina Central University. The transition came from her searching for “validation,” she said in the interview.  “I was looking for love and acceptance from people,” she said. “People to love me, to accept me, to pay attention to me for validation. But you can get all of that in Jesus. He loves us just the way we are. That’s what I learned in prison.  “I hurt my brothers and I hope they can forgive me and I want them to know that I love them and they didn’t deserve that and I hope they can forgive me. I hope they can heal.”  The danger of false rape allegations for actual victims  An advocate for victims of sexual assault said rare cases like this might discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and cause people to wrongly doubt them.  “False reports hurt not only the people falsely accused, they hurt every rape victim,” Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, vice president of communications for RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, told CNN. “There are already too many victims who do not report the crime for fear of not being believed. After a false report in such a high-profile case, even more survivors may be reluctant to come forward out of fear that law enforcement will not believe them.”  A study published by Violence Against Women in 2010 found that false sexual assault reports range from between 2 to 10 percent.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor.",US,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,,,,0.113,0.794,0.093,-0.9676
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/kirstin-lobato-las-vegas-verdict/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"Las Vegas AP —  A federal jury in Nevada has awarded more than $34 million to a woman who was arrested at age 18, wrongly convicted twice, and served nearly 16 years in a Nevada state prison for a 2001 killing she did not commit.  Kirstin Lobato, who is now 41 and uses the name Blaise, cried and hugged her attorneys after a judge read the trial verdict Thursday in US District Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  “It’s been an uphill battle with many, many obstacles,” she told reporters. “And I’m happy that it’s all finally finished.”  Lobato said she didn’t know if becoming a millionaire would make up for years in prison, adding that she had “no idea what the rest of my life is going to look like.”  The civil trial jury found Las Vegas police and two detectives, now retired, fabricated evidence during their investigation and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Lobato. The panel determined that Lobato should receive $34 million in compensatory damages from the department and $10,000 in punitive damages from each former detective.  The detectives, Thomas Thowsen and James LaRochelle, and their attorney, Craig Anderson, declined to comment outside court. Anderson told US District Judge Richard Boulware he planned to file additional court documents following the verdict. Anderson said Friday an appeal was “likely.”  The department previously agreed to pay damages if the jury ruled in Lobato’s favor.  Lobato was 18 when she was interviewed by police without an attorney, arrested and charged with killing Duran Bailey in Las Vegas in July 2001. Bailey, who had been homeless, was found dead near a trash bin with a slashed neck, cracked skull and missing genitals.  No physical evidence or witnesses connected Lobato to the killing, and she maintained she never met Bailey. But police maintained she confessed in jail that she had killed a man who tried to rape her during a three-day methamphetamine binge.  Lobato was 19 when she was convicted of murder in 2002. The Nevada Supreme Court threw out that verdict and Lobato’s prison sentence in 2004 because her lawyers weren’t able to cross-examine a prosecution witness who testified that Lobato made the jailhouse confession.  Lobato was tried again in 2006, convicted of manslaughter, mutilation and weapon charges, and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison.  She was exonerated and freed from prison in late 2017 after the Innocence Project and attorneys in Las Vegas again took her case to the state Supreme Court. Justices said evidence showed that Lobato was in her hometown of Panaca, Nevada, some 150 miles from Las Vegas when Bailey was killed.  Last October, a state court judge in Las Vegas issued a certificate declaring Lobato innocent of Bailey’s killing.  That action was challenged by Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson in a letter asking state Attorney General Aaron Ford to investigate how and why attorneys for Lobato acquired the certificate of innocence.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/baby-garnet-cold-case-michigan/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"CNN —  It was the middle of Jenna Gerwatowski’s workday at the local flower shop in Newberry, Michigan, when she got a call from an unknown number.  The now 23-year-old doesn’t usually answer unknown calls, but says she decided to pick this one up in May 2022.  To her surprise, it was a detective from the Michigan state police.  “He was like, ‘Have you heard of the Baby Garnet case?’” Jenna told CNN.  Jenna had heard of it. In 1997, a deceased infant was found in a campground pit toilet at the Garnet Lake Campground – right where Jenna grew up. Investigators couldn’t find any leads on the identity of the baby or anyone who witnessed a person abandoning an infant, according to a news release from the Michigan attorney general’s office. The case went cold, and the “Baby Garnet” case became a known murder mystery in Jenna’s small town for decades.  “Your DNA was a match,” Jenna says the detective on the phone told her. She was related to the dead infant from 1997.  Jenna was in shock. The detective sounded sure, Jenna said, but she wondered how he had even obtained her DNA.  About six months earlier, her friend had gotten a FamilyTreeDNA test for Christmas and Jenna decided to order her own. DNA from other Baby Garnet relatives led detectives to Jenna’s FamilyTreeDNA kit, according to court documents.  Jenna Gerwatowski, left, says the case was always a big mystery in her town. She had no idea the grandmother she'd never met, Nancy Gerwatowski, right, could be behind it. Jenna Rose Gerwatowski/Mackinac County Sheriff's Office  The detective said a woman from Identifinders International, a genetic genealogy investigation firm, would call her about her DNA to help with identifying closer relatives, according to Jenna.  According to court documents, detectives reopened the cold case in 2017 and then worked with a forensics company to extract DNA from Baby Garnet’s partial femur, before sending the results to Identifinders International.  Jenna explained the situation to her mother when she got home from work.  “It was just crazy,” Jenna said. “We were both sitting there like, I don’t even know who (the mother or father) could’ve been. We were both so confused and we’re like, it’s got to be somebody that we don’t know, you know, like a distant cousin or something.”  Jenna said her mother, Kara Gerwatowski, started to wonder whether the detective call was a scam.  Jenna’s grandfather had just been scammed by someone claiming to be a detective, so Kara told Jenna to be cautious about giving out personal information or passwords.  Misty Gillis, then a senior forensic genealogist and cold case liaison from Identifinders International, called Jenna that night, according to Jenna and court documents filed later in the case.  Jenna claims Gillis requested her FamilyTreeDNA password to be able to upload her DNA into a separate database. Jenna was concerned it was a scammer and refused to cooperate, according to court documents.  “I hung up the phone on her, not even thinking twice about it. And we went about our day. I was like, how weird. What a weird thing to scam people about,” Jenna said. “I wholeheartedly did not think that it was real.”  One week later, Jenna was working at the flower shop when she got a distressed call from her mother.  “She was like, ‘I really need you to come home. … It’s an emergency. Like, just please come as soon as you can,’” Jenna said.  Jenna rushed home thinking someone died. Her cousin was sitting with her mom at their round wooden kitchen table. Police had contacted her cousin, who works as a victim’s advocate in the county prosecutor’s office, to explain the Baby Garnet situation to Jenna. It turned out it wasn’t a scam.  “My mom had tears in her eyes,” she said. Jenna’s cousin had “just pure shock on her face. … You could hear a pin drop in there.”  Even though Jenna knew she had nothing to do with the Baby Garnet case, she was terrified police would think she was trying to hide something because of her refusal to speak with Gillis. She immediately called her.  An analysis of Jenna’s DNA kit showed she was the half-niece to Baby Garnet, according to court records.  On June 1, 2022, detectives spoke with her mother, Kara, who agreed to provide her DNA. Kara was the half-sister of Baby Garnet, according to court records.  “I feel like that is when, like, all of the puzzle pieces kind of started falling together for her,” Jenna said. “And she told detectives that, if it’s going to be anybody, it would be (her) mother.”  Kara, now 42, had not spoken with her mother, Nancy Gerwatowski, since she was 18 because they had a bad relationship, and Jenna had never met her grandmother. Regardless, both were shocked Nancy, who was living in Wyoming when police questioned her, would be the one behind their town mystery.  “I had grown up knowing about the case my whole life and then come to find out it was my grandma that did it?” Jenna said.  The Michigan attorney general’s office alleges Nancy “delivered the newborn alone at her Newberry home, during which Baby Garnet died due to asphyxiation, and that this death could have been prevented by medical intervention (Nancy) Gerwatowski did not seek.”  However, in a court filing, Nancy’s defense argues she unexpectedly gave birth while in the bathtub and the fetus “became trapped inside her birth canal.” She “attempted to pull the fetus out of her own body,” the filing says, but couldn’t deliver the fetus and lost consciousness “at some point in the delivery.” When she was finally able to deliver the fetus, it was dead, the filing says.  Her defense argues that Nancy, like the average person in the county in 1997, did not have access to a telephone or cell line, so she couldn’t call 911. While she concedes in her legal filings she placed the stillborn fetus in a bag and left the remains at the campground, her defense attorneys argue she had been in shock after having had no pain medication during the traumatic birth.  Nancy is charged with one count each of open murder, involuntary manslaughter, and concealing the death of an individual. Open murder carries a potential life sentence.  In a hearing on Thursday, Nancy’s defense argued that the case against her should be dropped in its entirety because the state cannot prove the baby was born alive. If the court allows the case to proceed, the defense argued, Nancy’s statements during police interrogation should be excluded because she was denied her right to counsel — a contention the state disputed. If the court does allow her statements to be a part of the trial, Nancy’s lawyers want her comments about considering an abortion and not seeking out prenatal care to be excluded, while the state argued the comments are relevant to possible motive.  Judge Brian D. Rahilly said he hopes to reach a decision on whether or not to drop the charges by next week or around the end of the year at the latest.  “It was a very hard time … very traumatizing and very nerve-wracking,” said Jenna. “I’ve never met this woman, so it was hard for me to even grasp that concept, but even harder for my mom because that was her mother.”",US,Baby Garnet cold case update: A DNA test helped solve a 1997 Michigan murder,,,,0.144,0.794,0.061,-0.9991
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-thursday-hnk/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"CNN —  Marked shell casings from the assassination scene match the gun found on the suspect. His fingerprints match some key items investigators found nearby. And he was arrested this week – after going silent from his mom and friends for months – with a fake ID and a handwritten “claim of responsibility” referencing the crime site.  These details and others, shared by law enforcement and people who know suspect Luigi Mangione, have been mounting since last week’s daylight killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a busy sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of the investigation into Thompson’s killing, sources tell CNN.  A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN at least two of the warrants include the backpack found in Central Park and the burner phone found along the getaway route police believe Mangione took from the shooting scene. Investigators also searched the hostel where suspected killer Mangione stayed the night before the shooting and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  After a five-day, multi-state manhunt that leaned heavily on surveillance images and pleas for the public’s help, Mangione, 26, is now charged in the case with murder after a tip led to his arrest Monday at a McDonald’s nearly 200 miles from where the brazen homicide unfolded.  Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury in the case against Mangione, sources told ABC News.  Mangione was charged in a felony arrest warrant earlier this week. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  Blair County Judge David Consiglio scheduled a hearing in Pennsylvania on December 30 in response to Mangione’s petitions for writ of habeas corpus and imposition of bail, court documents from Thursday show.  Mangione was denied bail on Tuesday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania. The habeas corpus petition is a key factor in whether the suspect can be extradited to New York.  Mangione’s team was given two weeks from Tuesday to file the habeas corpus petition, which challenges Pennsylvania’s ability to prove that Mangione is the person the state of New York has issued the arrest warrant for, according to Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.  Mangione is also set to appear in an Altoona, Pennsylvania, court on December 23 for a preliminary hearing related to state charges.  Mangione’s lawyer has denied his client’s involvement in the December 4 killing and anticipates he will plead not guilty to the murder and other charges in New York, as well as to charges related to the 3D-printed gun and fake ID in Pennsylvania, where he was caught and is being held without bond.  Defense attorney Thomas Dickey on Wednesday also dismissed the ballistics and fingerprint evidence revealed publicly hours earlier, saying he wants to examine it himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”  Thomas Dickey, attorney for suspected shooter Luigi Mangione, speaks Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “As lawyers, we need to see it. We need to see: How did they collect it? How much of it? And then we would have our experts … take a look at that, and then we would challenge its admissibility and challenge the accuracy of those results.”  Still, New York’s governor expects a murder indictment “to be issued any day now, and the second that happens, I’m issuing a warrant for extradition.”  “It feels like the evidence is very compelling,” Gov. Kathy Hochul told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. “I trust the DA here in Manhattan to make sure that he puts forth an indictment that is going to be iron-clad.”  Meanwhile, Hochul is unimpressed by the folk hero status Mangione has attained on social media as the killing of Thompson – a husband and father of two – has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry.  Mangione appears to have been driven by anger against the industry and “corporate greed” as a whole, states a New York Police Department intelligence report that also warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  “That horrific attack occurred on our streets,” Hochul said Thursday. “And the people of our city deserve to have that sense of calm that this perpetrator has been caught, and he will be never seeing the late of day again if there is justice.”  “You cannot assassinate an individual on the streets of New York – not now, not ever.”  Neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said on Thursday.  Suspect hadn’t spoken to mother since July  Until he was found Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Mangione had gone quiet from at least a few people who appear to have been close with him. The scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, he had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  Mangione’s mother had reported him missing November 18 – two weeks before Thompson’s killing – a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. She called police in San Francisco, where she knew her son had been living, and told authorities she’d called his phone repeatedly to find the voicemail full and not taking any more messages.  Mangione’s mom had no reason to believe her son was a danger to himself or others, she told the San Francisco Police Department, but she hadn’t actually spoken with him since July 1, the official said. He had worked remotely at TrueCar, she also said, where the phone was disconnected and the offices closed, the official added.  It also doesn’t appear Mangione had posted anything since midsummer to social media, where posts addressed to his X account suggest some of his friends have been trying to get in touch with him.  In July, a user tweeted at Mangione, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding. In late November, just weeks before the shooting, another user posted at Mangione, “thinking of you and prayers everyday in your name. Know you are missed and loved.”  As Mangione entered a Pennsylvania courthouse this week, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, he yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Suspected shooter Luigi Mangione is led from the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  “He’s irritated, agitated about what’s happening to him and what he’s being accused of,” Dickey told CNN of Mangione’s outburst and struggle with police.  “He never had any legal representation until he walked into that building yesterday. And I talked to him … look at the difference between when he went in and when he came out … now he has a spokesperson and someone that’s going to fight for him.”  Suspect linked to fingerprints and gun  Police in New York on Wednesday publicly revealed the first positive forensic match and direct physical evidence tying Mangione to Thompson’s killing, law enforcement officials told CNN.  “We got the gun in question back from Pennsylvania. It’s now at the NYPD crime lab,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “We were able to match that gun to the three shell casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of the homicide.”  A 3D-printed gun was in Mangione’s possession when he was arrested Monday, police have said.  The three 9 mm shell casings had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, one word per bullet, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Police have been looking into whether those words, which match the title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry, may point to a motive in the killing.  Authorities also had been probing DNA material and a partial fingerprint from a discarded Starbucks water bottle and an energy bar wrapper surveillance images showed the suspect buying about 30 minutes before the shooting. Mangione’s fingerprints were confirmed as a match, Tisch said  Along with the prints and ballistics, investigators have been examining writings police have said Mangione had upon arrest, including a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility.” It did not include specific threats but indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday.  In some writings, he referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny added. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  Investigators also are looking at the suspect’s writing in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN.  It included to-do lists to facilitate a killing, as well as notes justifying those plans, the source said. In one notebook passage, Mangione wrote about the late Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber who justified a deadly bombing campaign as an effort to protect against the onslaught of technology and exploitation. Mangione had written about the Unabomber in online posts as well.  In a notebook passage, Mangione concludes using a bomb against his intended victim “could kill innocents” and shooting would be more targeted, musing what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.

The statement did not indicate where Kobayashi was or how the family determined she was safe.  The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement they are “happy to learn that Hannah has been found safe” and due to the new information “this has become a private matter and we will wrap up our investigation.”  The family had launched a GoFundMe that raised over $47,000 to help find Hannah.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/louisville-police-reform-breonna-taylor/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"Louisville, Kentucky AP —  The US Justice Department and the city of Louisville have reached an agreement to reform the city’s police force after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, officials said Thursday.  The consent decree, which must be approved by a judge, follows a federal investigation that found Louisville police have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the “historic content decree” will build upon and accelerate, this transformational police reform we have already begun in Louisville.” He noted that “significant improvements” have already been implemented since Taylor’s death in March 2020. That includes a city law banning the use of “no-knock” warrants.  The Justice Department report released in March 2023 said the Louisville police department “discriminates against Black people in its enforcement activities,” uses excessive force and conducts searches based on invalid warrants. It also said the department violates the rights of people engaged in protests.  “This conduct harmed community members and undermined public trust in law enforcement that is essential for public safety,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This consent decree marks a new day for Louisville.”  Once the consent decree is agreed upon, a federal officer will monitor the progress made by the city.  The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened 12 civil rights investigations into law enforcement agencies, but this is the first that has reached a consent decree. The Justice Department and the city of Springfield, Massachusetts announced an agreement in 2022 but the investigation into that police department was opened under President Donald Trump’s first administration.  City officials in Memphis have taken a different approach, pushing against the need for a Justice Department consent decree to enact reforms in light of a federal investigation launched after Tyre Nichols’ killing that found Memphis officers routinely use unwarranted force and disproportionately target Black people. Memphis officials have not ruled eventually agreeing to a consent decree, but have said the city can make changes more effectively without committing to a binding pact.  It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department’s priorities around civil rights.",US,"DOJ, Louisville reach deal after probe prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor",,,,0.054,0.79,0.156,0.9902
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings-investigation/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"CNN —  Weeks of mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey are prompting heightened security concerns – and mounting frustrations – from residents, military personnel and federal, state and local officials.  While the state’s governor says there’s no threat to public safety, other state officials and local mayors are alarmed.  “I’m legitimately concerned for what the hell is going on because nobody knows,” state Assemblyman Brian Bergen told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey after a briefing at state police headquarters on Wednesday.  “We are literally being invaded by drones. We have no idea who is doing it and where they’re coming from,” Pequannock Mayor Ryan Herb told the station after the briefing.  Law enforcement has not identified the origin or landing sites of the drones, Mayor Michael Melham of Belleville Township said in a Facebook video update on Wednesday. He added that the drones primarily operate at night, often displaying flashing lights, but they turn off the lights and evade police helicopters when approached.  According to Melham, the drones have eluded radar detection, possibly because they do not emit frequencies or possess evasion capabilities.  He also raised alarm over where some of the drones have been spotted.  “One of the takeaways today was that these drones statewide are hovering and appearing to be surveilling New Jersey’s critical infrastructure,” Melham said.  The mayor of West Milford, Michele Dale, reported 60 drones hovering over local reservoirs.  Some members of Congress have speculated that a foreign entity may be involved in the drones, something the Pentagon rebuffed Wednesday.  The denial came hours after US Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, told Fox News the drones were from “a mothership” from Iran that is “off the East Coast of the United States of America.”  “There is not any truth to that,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.”  Meanwhile, US Northern Command, which oversees the Defense Department’s homeland security efforts, said in statement Wednesday that it had “conducted a deliberate analysis of the events” regarding the drone sightings but had not been asked “to assist with these events.”  A spokesperson for the US Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged an encounter by one of its assets with the drones.  “Multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in the vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park, Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  The aircraft were not seen as an immediate threat and did not interfere with operations, Pinneo added.  CNN reached out to the Coast Guard but did not receive an immediate response.  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told WBGO on Wednesday the public should feel secure while acknowledging their fears.  “Based on everything we know, there is no public safety risks we’re aware of,” Murphy said.  “Is it frustrating to have no answers? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes,” the governor told the radio station.  The sightings began November 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. At times, large drones — some up to 6 feet in diameter — were seen nightly in New Jersey from dusk until 11 p.m., with sightings ranging from 4 to 180, according to state lawmakers who attended the briefing Wednesday.  The drones operate in a coordinated manner, turning off their lights to evade detection, complicating tracking efforts. They are not identified as hobbyist drones or linked to the Department of Homeland Security, State Assembly member Dawn Fantasia said on X.  The FBI is leading the investigation with the New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, while the US Coast Guard is assessing jurisdictional responses.  Federal agencies have ruled out any connections of local, state, or federal governments to the sightings.  Melham called for a temporary flight ban on all personnel and commercial drones in his video update, despite official advisories against such measures.  Concerns escalated after drones were spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to military officials and state lawmakers. The sightings prompted the FAA to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.  Unnerved residents have described frequently seeing the drones hovering overhead, sometimes traveling in clusters.  While visiting family in New Jersey, travel content creator Katie Caf initially doubted reports of drones until she spotted several moving in a “zigzagging” pattern on Saturday. The 29-year-old noticed five potential drones, which she described as being the size of a bicycle. “They’re so weird looking and they’re much bigger than normal drones. I get why everyone is freaking out now … I think it’s kinda spooky.”  Fantasia said on X that the briefing occurred Wednesday at the New Jersey State Police headquarters and included descriptions of the aircraft’s movements and federal agencies’ response.  Though Murphy has said there is no known threat to the public, Fantasia and other local leaders have expressed doubt and are demanding more transparency into the investigation.  US Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, pushed for more information from federal investigators in a letter sent Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  “I recognize the need to maintain operational security of ongoing investigations and that this situation requires complex interagency coordination,” Booker wrote. “However, there is a growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state – from constituents and local officials alike – despite assurances that the drones pose no known threats to public safety.”  The FBI in Newark has asked the public to report any information related to the drones, including in several areas along the Raritan River.  “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI field office in Newark said December 3.  During a US Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday, Robert Wheeler, assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, called the phenomenon “concerning” but said “there is nothing that is known” that would lead him to identify a public safety risk.  CNN has sought more information from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and New Jersey State Police.  This story has been updated with additional information.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/university-of-mississippi-student-killing-mistrial/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"AP —  A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the case of Sheldon “Timothy” Herrington Jr. in the 2022 killing of Jimmie “Jay” Lee, a gay man who was prominent in the LGBTQ+ community at the University of Mississippi.  Jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict after over nine and a half hours of deliberation.  Lee’s body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead.  Herrington, 24, showed little emotion as he left the courtroom with his attorneys and several relatives. He remains free on bond and is still charged with capital murder, which Mississippi law defines as a killing committed along with another felony — in this case, kidnapping. Prosecutors had said they would not seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison if he is tried again and convicted.  Jurors on Wednesday were told they could also consider lesser charges of first-degree murder, punishable by life in prison; second-degree murder, 20 years to life; or manslaughter, up to 20 years.  University of Mississippi student Jimmie ""Jay"" Lee is seen in this undated image. Oxford Police Police Department  Circuit Judge Kelly Luther said he will consult with prosecutors and defense attorneys about setting another trial.  Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee, 20, was pursuing a master’s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.  Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, where the university is located and the trial was held.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee vanished. Investigators testified that they used warrants to obtain electronic records including explicit messages between social media accounts belonging to the two men and online searches conducted by Herrington, including one inquiring how long it takes to strangle someone.  Prosecutors said during closing arguments Wednesday that Herrington and Lee had a sexual encounter that ended badly and Lee left Herrington’s apartment. They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex. Prosecutors said Lee was killed after going back.  “Tim Herrington lived a lie — lived a lie to his family,” District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. “He lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.”  Herrington’s attorney, Kevin Horan, has said prosecutors cannot prove Lee is dead without having a body. He told jurors Wednesday that text messages showed Herrington did not lure Lee to his apartment.  Judge Kelly Luther presides over the case of Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr. at the Lafayette County Courthouse in Oxford, Mississippi, on Wednesday. Bruce Newman/Pool/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal/AP  “He’s the one that’s being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,” Horan said of Lee.  Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.  Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.  Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained explicit messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.  Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched “how long does it take to strangle someone” at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.  The final text message from Lee’s phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington’s apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee’s phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee’s car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.  On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.  Herrington’s relatives sat behind him in the courtroom, and Lee’s sat behind prosecutors. When Luther dismissed court after the mistrial, he instructed the two groups to leave separately.  Jurors were chosen from another county about 250 miles to the south. They heard eight days of arguments and testimony.  The judge twice urged jurors to continue deliberating when they said they were deadlocked. After the third such message, Luther declared the mistrial and thanked them for serving, adding: “I’ve asked a lot of you.”",US,Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee: Judge declares mistrial after jury deadlocks over killing of gay University of Mississippi student,,,,0.136,0.808,0.056,-0.9977
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/us/timeline-luigi-magione-ceo-shooting/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"CNN —  As investigators work to piece together the possible motive and movements of 26-year-old Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione, suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, here’s what we know.  This timeline is based on information from law enforcement sources, official police releases, surveillance images and social media records.  Summer of 2024  Mangione had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced.  During the summer, Mangione appears to stop posting online, prompting worried messages from some of his friends.  In July, one user posts on X, tagging Mangione, saying, “I haven’t heard from you in months,” urging him to let him know if Mangione could honor the “commitments” he had made for the user’s wedding.  Mid-November  Mangione’s mother reports her son missing in San Francisco, law enforcement officials said.  Sunday, November 24  10:11 p.m. – Mangione arrives in New York at the Port Authority bus terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue via a bus that originated in Atlanta, then gets into a cab that takes him to the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, where he stays about half an hour.  There was an interaction while the suspect was checking in at the hostel, making casual conversation. ""At some point, he pulled his mask down and smiled at the at the clerk,"" said Joseph Kenny, NYPD chief of detectives. NYPD  11 p.m. – He takes another cab to a hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave. on the Upper West Side, identified as HI New York City Hostel in charging documents.  11:20 p.m. - Surveillance footage from the hostel shows him checking in and showing a driver’s license, according to the arrest warrant in the case. Records from the hostel show he provided a New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario on it, the warrant says.  Friday, November 29  Mangione checks out of the hostel.  “It’s not your traditional check in, check out. It’s the kind of thing where if you don’t show up at a certain time, they automatically just check you out,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. “We don’t believe that he went someplace else. It’s more of an administrative checkout.”  Saturday, November 30  Mangione checks back into the hostel.  Wednesday, December 4  5:34 a.m. – Surveillance footage reviewed by law enforcement shows Mangione leaving the hostel, possibly by bike.  5:41 a.m. – He is seen wandering around the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown, on Sixth Avenue between West 53rd and 54th Streets, and goes back and forth for a bit before heading toward a Starbucks.  “We have him wandering around, walking in the vicinity of hotel, walking on 54th Street, walking back and forth,” Kenny said.  Around 6:17 a.m. – Images from Starbucks show him buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, according to a law enforcement official.  Image of the suspect at a Starbucks on Sixth Avenue. NYPD  6:19 a.m. – Surveillance video near a deli on West 55th Street appears to show him walking and briefly stopping by a pile of trash.  Gideon Platt, Stage Star Deli  6:30 a.m. – Around 6:30 a.m., surveillance video captures what appears to be the gunman on the phone.  Patrick Laborde  6:44 a.m. – Thompson, the victim, walks toward the Hilton after leaving his hotel across the street, police said.  The masked gunman is “lying in wait” outside the hotel as Thompson makes his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.  The gunman comes up behind Thompson and shoots him in the back, Kenny said. He then walks toward Thompson and continues to shoot, stopping to clear a gun jam before firing again.  Obtained by CNN  Investigators told CNN that after the shooting, the assailant crosses the street from the Hilton, flees northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street, and gets on an electric bike on 55th Street before heading north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.  Obtained by CNN  6:48 a.m. – Mangione is seen riding an electric bike into Central Park at 60th Street, according to Kenny.  NYPD  6:56 a.m. – He rides out of the park.  6:58 a.m. - He is seen on the bike at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue.  7:00 a.m. - He is no longer on the bike and is heading northbound on 86th Street.  7:04 a.m. - Mangione gets into a cab.  7:30 a.m. – He is seen near the George Washington Bridge and a Port Authority bus station off 178th Street.  Video shows the suspect entering the bus station.  “We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” Kenny said.  5-Day Manhunt  The suspect was in Pennsylvania for “several days” after the shooting in Manhattan, according to Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police.  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the suspect traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in Altoona, where he is arrested.  Monday, December 9  In a new post on social media, Pennsylvania State Police shared new images of Luigi Mangione sitting inside the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was captured on Monday. The images show Mangione eating what appears to be a hash brown inside the establishment. Pennsylvania State Police  9:14 a.m. - Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania are dispatched to a McDonald’s restaurant, after an employee tipped off police about someone resembling photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police.  9:58 a.m. - Mangione is taken into custody at the McDonald’s, where he presented police with a forged New Jersey Driver’s License with the name of Mark Rosario as his identification – the same ID he presented at the hostel, according to the arrest warrant.  Mangione was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea in his first court appearance in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, later that day.  Mangione has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a firearm, according to charging documents released by New York prosecutors.",US,Timeline: Before and after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s killing,,,,0.063,0.905,0.031,-0.9823
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/us/wisconsin-kayaker-fake-death-in-custody/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"Green Lake, Wisconsin AP —  A Wisconsin man who faked his own drowning and left his wife and three children to go to Eastern Europe is in police custody, online records show.  Ryan Borgwardt, 45, was booked into the Green Lake County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system, a service that provides information to crime victims such as a person’s jail custody status. No charges were listed.  The Green Lake County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday in a social media post that a news conference would be held Wednesday morning to update the Borgwardt case. The post said no further information would be provided until then.  A person answering the phone at the sheriff’s office Tuesday night declined to confirm whether Borgwardt was in custody. County jail officials didn’t immediately return a phone message Tuesday night.  Last month, Sheriff Mark Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on November 11 after disappearing for three months but that he hadn’t committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were “pulling at his heartstrings” to come home. He suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance.  Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of “personal matters,” the sheriff said. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it’s the deepest in Wisconsin.  After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane.  The sheriff said at the time that investigators were working to verify Borgwardt’s description of what happened.  The sheriff’s office has said the search for Borgwardt’s body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn’t expect the search to last more than two weeks.",US,"Ryan Borgwardt: Wisconsin kayaker who faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe is in custody, online records show",,,,0.06,0.933,0.007,-0.9398

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/trump-administration-big-donors/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"CNN —  Nearly three dozen of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks to serve in his incoming administration donated to his campaign or to the deep-pocketed outside groups that worked to elect him, a CNN analysis of federal campaign records shows.  They range from tech multibillionaire Elon Musk – who has emerged as the single largest, disclosed political donor of the 2024 presidential election – to others close to Trump tapped for key roles throughout government.  In all, eight of his Cabinet picks – led by Linda McMahon, the billionaire wrestling magnate Trump has selected to oversee the Education Department – and their spouses donated more than $37 million combined from their personal accounts to aid Trump, the review found, underscoring the proliferation of ultra-rich Americans now poised to shape US policy in the incoming second Trump administration.  (Two other Cabinet choices, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, transferred money from their campaign accounts to the pro-Trump effort.)  Musk has not been selected for a formal Cabinet job but is helping guide a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative and has played a pivotal role in the presidential transition – offering his views on job candidates, talking to world leaders and meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as he weighs how to downsize the federal government.  In all, the SpaceX and Tesla chief executive donated more than $277 million to federal elections this cycle, the lion’s share of which – more than $262 million – benefited Trump. Most of Musk’s pro-Trump dollars flowed to a super PAC that the world’s richest man created to help turn out voters on the Republican’s behalf in key swing states.  Outside of self-funded presidential candidates, no individual has donated more to shape federal contests in a single election cycle, said Brendan Glavin, research director of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes money in politics.  Trump’s donors “are not just getting these sort of plum ambassadorships on the side,” Glavin said. “Major donors are getting positions that affect policy.”  The CNN analysis researched the more than 90 people that Trump had announced for high-level positions in the administration through Tuesday, which marked five weeks since his election victory. More than 30 of them had donated to his campaign or to one of the leading Trump-aligned outside groups, the review of FEC records found.  “Millions of Americans fed up with failure in the White House and federal government joined President Trump in the movement to restore our nation’s greatness. Some who will work with President Trump are among those millions of people who supported the campaign and helped the President win a decisive electoral victory,” Brian Hughes, a Trump transition team spokesman, said in a statement in response to CNN’s inquiry about donors joining the administration.  The total donations from Trump’s current Cabinet picks marks a surge from Trump’s first term. Five members of his original Cabinet had donated nearly $8 million to his committees or to the major outside groups supporting him, a review of campaign reports shows.  Donations from McMahon, who served as Trump’s SBA administrator in his first White House term, accounted for more than 90% of that total in the 2016 election.  The sums spent to aid Trump in 2024 far exceed the donations that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet members contributed to help him win the White House in 2020, FEC records show.  A dozen members of Biden’s Cabinet reported donations to his campaign or major super PACs involved in the 2020 election, giving less than $100,000 in total.  Billionaires in the administration  Musk’s spending dwarfed that of other supporters.  McMahon was the largest donor among Trump’s Cabinet picks and the second most generous contributor, after Musk, among the administration members announced through Tuesday, the review found.  Most of the $21.2 million she donated went to Make American Great Again, Inc., the main Trump-affiliated super PAC that spent heavily on advertising to aid his campaign.  Other seven-figure donors among Trump’s Cabinet picks include Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick, whom Trump has tapped to serve as Commerce secretary; Scott Bessent, the hedge fund executive Trump has selected to oversee the Treasury Department; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, his choice to head the Small Business Administration.  Loeffler’s husband, Jeff Sprecher, also was a major donor, contributing more than $2 million to the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and Trump’s joint fundraising committee.  Sprecher is the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and was at Trump’s side when the president-elect rang the opening bell at the exchange Thursday.  In an email, Loeffler’s communication director Caitlin O’Dea said, “Senator Loeffler is proud to be one of President Trump’s strongest supporters for the same reason a historic landslide of Americans voted to put him back in the White House: he will restore American prosperity, security, and opportunity.”  The billionaire embrace marks a turnaround of sorts for Trump, who saw corporate America recoil from him after the violent January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And he has seen new support from tech leaders who are pushing for fewer regulations from the federal government.  The staggering sums spent by Musk in this year’s election helped Trump close the financial advantage of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who swiftly raised $1 billion after becoming her party’s standard-bearer in late July.  Super PACs face no limit on the size of donations they can receive or spend, but technically are not allowed coordinate their advertising decisions with the candidates they support.  However, a ruling this year by the FEC granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing efforts freed up Musk to guide a ground game for Trump.  “The campaign finance system is a joke,” said Fred Wertheimer, who heads the Democracy 21 watchdog group and is a longtime advocate for limits on money in politics. “Musk is the example now of how campaign finance laws have failed.”  He said he worries about government departments led by billionaires who have no “interest in doing the job that the agency was assigned.”  Musk did not respond to inquiries from CNN.  But Tom Davis, a former congressman from Virginia who chaired the House Republicans’ campaign arm for several years, argues “there is nothing inherently wrong about people who made a lot of money wanting to give back through government.”  “The fact that they have contributed shows a degree of loyalty,” he added.  Friends and family  Presidents often reward donors and allies with plum positions – often dispatching them to glamorous, low-conflict posts in Europe or the Caribbean.  Some of Trump’s early picks for ambassadorships follow that pattern and include billionaires who donated to his reelection effort. Among them: Arkansas investor Warren Stephens, named as the US’ envoy to the UK, and Charles Kushner, Trump’s choice for ambassador to France – one of several extended family members or close friends who has been chosen for diplomatic gigs.  Kushner, who donated $2 million to pro-Trump efforts and received a presidential pardon at the end of Trump’s first term, is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. Another donor, Tom Barrack, who oversaw the fundraising for Trump’s first inauguration, is his choice as ambassador to Turkey.  And incoming special envoy to the Middle East, real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff, is a longtime Trump friend and a partner in the cryptocurrency businesses that Trump launched with his sons earlier this year.  He donated $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC.",US,Big donors secure big roles in the incoming Trump administration,,,,0.022,0.846,0.133,0.9994

Nancy Mace in March that a jury found Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll.  Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and that he defamed her when he denied her claim. Trump has denied all wrongdoing toward Carroll.  In 2023, a jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, though it did not find that Carroll proved he raped her. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million for batter and defamation. In January, Carroll was awarded an additional $83.3 million in damages for his defamatory statements disparaging her and denying her rape allegations.  The jury did not find that Carroll proved Trump had raped her. Instead, a judge concluded months later when dismissing Trump’s countersuit against Carroll that the claim Trump raped Carroll was “substantially true.” The judge wrote in August 2023 that Trump “raped” her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.  In the lawsuit filed against ABC News in March, Trump claimed that Stephanopoulos’ statements were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.”  The case was allowed to move forward in July, with the judge refusing to dismiss the lawsuit, writing that these definitions were different enough. He added that the case would turn on “whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury’s verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.”  This story is breaking and will be updated.",US,ABC News settles defamation suit with Trump for $15 million,,,,0.156,0.804,0.04,-0.9932
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/antony-blinken-jordan-syria/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"Aqaba, Jordan CNN —  The United States has had direct contact with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Syrian rebel group now in de-facto control of the country, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday.  The first public confirmation of direct interaction with the US-designated terrorist group, known as HTS, came at the conclusion of Blinken’s diplomatic sprint through the region spurred by the sudden collapse of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  “Yes, we’ve been in contact with HTS and the other parties,” Blinken said at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan. Blinken did not give details on when the contact was made or at what level. There is no legal barrier to speaking with a designated terrorist group.  “We have pressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,” Blinken said, referencing the American journalist who was detained in Syria more than a decade ago. The US has redoubled its efforts to find him in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse.  The US also shared the principles expected of a new Syrian government, including that the rights of all Syrians should be respected, that the country must not become a base for terrorism, that humanitarian aid must be delivered, and that chemical weapons stockpiles should be secured and safely destroyed.  Those principles, circulated by the US in the days after Assad’s shocking ouster, were further agreed upon in a joint statement by the US and a coalition of other countries at an urgent ministerial meeting in Aqaba on Saturday. Blinken said the agreement “sends a unified message to the new interim authority and parties in Syria.”  Ahead of the Saturday ministerial meeting, Blinken met with key partners in Jordan, Turkey and Iraq to garner consensus around the principles.  “America and our partners have an important stake in helping the Syrian people chart this new path,” the top US diplomat said Saturday. “We know what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders — from mass displacement to terrorism.”  “We can’t underestimate the challenges of this moment and the weeks and months ahead,” he added.  Throughout his trip, Blinken sought to emphasize those stakes. Moving forward, the dynamics on the ground in the region could present significant complications, despite a consensus on the principles.  There was an intense spate of fighting in recent weeks in northern Syria between Turkish-backed forces and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which the US sees as a key partner in the fight to keep ISIS degraded.  A fragile truce between the two sides in Manbij appears to be holding, but the fighting forced the SDF to halt its anti-ISIS operations, according to its top commander.  “This is a moment of vulnerability in which ISIS will seek to regroup, taking the advantage of transition in Syria,” Blinken said Saturday, reemphasizing the importance of the SDF.  In meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Ankara, Blinken warned the US does not want to see any party take actions that would allow ISIS to regroup, including by distracting the SDF from its mission to keep the terrorist group degraded and its fighters imprisoned, a US official said. Blinken also emphasized that nobody should take actions that could jeopardize factions in Syria from potentially coming together in a unified government.  In Baghdad, Blinken asked Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to crack down on the powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and to prevent Iran from transiting weapons through Iraq to Shia militias in Syria, the US official said. Such militias have targeted US personnel and interests in the past.  The response to Israel’s actions in Syria has also emerged as point of division between the US and its Arab partners.  Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has pummeled Syria with strikes and sent Israeli troops to — and beyond — a “buffer zone” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria, in what the United Nations said would be a violation of a 1974 agreement. Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Qatar have condemned Israel’s seizure of the buffer zone, calling it an attempted land grab.  The US, however, has not condemned the move, with Blinken saying that they are talking with the Israeli government.  “The stated purpose of those actions from the Israelis is to try to make sure that equipment that’s been abandoned — military equipment that’s been abandoned by the Syrian army — doesn’t fall into the wrong hands: terrorists, extremists, etc.,” he said Thursday. “But … we’re already talking with Israel; we’re all talking to others about the way ahead.”  A US official said Friday that Blinken intends to make clear to his Arab counterparts that Israel told the US that the incursion is temporary — and that the US expects it to be. That policy could change, however, next month when the Trump administration takes office, this official conceded.

Nancy Pelosi underwent a “successful” hip replacement surgery Saturday and is “well on the mend,” according to a spokesperson, one day after being hospitalized from an injury sustained during an official engagement in Luxembourg.  Pelosi was admitted to a hospital in Luxembourg as the result of a fall on the stairs, three sources told CNN. Pelosi’s office declined to comm﻿ent on how the California congresswoman was injured.  Pelosi, 84, is receiving “excellent care” from doctors and medical professionals, Ian Krager, the spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday.  The US military had medevaced the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. The medical center is a major military hospital that for years has treated US troops injured in combat.  “While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,” Krager said Friday.  Pelosi is “currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals. She continues to work and regrets that she is unable to attend the remainder of the CODEL engagements to honor the courage of our servicemembers during one of the greatest acts of American heroism in our nation’s history,” Krager said, adding that Pelosi “looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.”  The injury sustained by Pelosi came just days after longtime Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell tripped and fell at the US Capitol, spraining his wrist and cutting his face.  McConnell sustained a “minor cut to the face” and was “cleared to resume his schedule,” a spokesperson for the 82-year-old Kentucky Republican said in a statement Tuesday.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-ban-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"CNN —  TikTok has plans for another appeal as it faces a ban on January 19.  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected a temporary pause on the ban of TikTok, calling such a block “unwarranted” and paving the way for the Supreme Court to potentially decide the fate of the popular video-sharing app.  In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that required TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, to be sold to a non-Chinese company. The latest ruling follows last week’s decision by the same appeals court to uphold the law, citing national security concerns.  The Biden administration previously urged the appeals court not to issue a temporary block on the law, arguing that doing so might allow the company to wait months to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, effectively halting the law indefinitely.  “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said on December 6.  What will TikTok’s next appeal look like?  The Supreme Court could make a quick decision on the case. Both TikTok and the federal government previously asked the appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the January 19 ban.  But the Supreme Court, which has a six-justice conservative majority, seems likely to rule in favor of upholding the ban, Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN earlier this month.  “I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” Schiller said.  Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN earlier this month that the Supreme Court may decide not to review the case at all, in which case TikTok is out of luck.  Do you need to delete the app?  Not necessarily.  The Department of Justice said Wednesday that, if the ban takes effect, it would “not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok” for the app’s more than 170 million monthly users. But don’t expect any more updates from the app or the ability to download it, if the ban takes place.  Two leaders of the US House of Representatives’ committee on China sent a bipartisan letter to the CEOs of Apple and Google parent company Alphabet that said they should prepare to remove TikTok from their US app stores on January 19.  TikTok will also be unavailable on internet hosting platforms. The Justice Department warned users can expect the app to “eventually” be unworkable.  Can the ban be avoided?  There’s still some hope that TikTok could remain active in the United States, though ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell it.  The ban’s legislation leaves room for Biden to grant a one-time, 90-day extension if he determines a company has made progress toward a sale. He hasn’t suggested any plans to do so.  President-elect Donald Trump, who begins his term a day after the ban, could be on TikTok’s side. He said in July (in a video posted to the app) that he would “never ban TikTok” — although he did try to ban it during his first term.  There are a few options: Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, though experts say that’s unlikely to be successful. He could also direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month.",US,TikTok’s ban won’t be delayed.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/business/tiktok-shop-ban/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"CNN —  Aakaanksh Autade was iffy on TikTok Shop, TikTok’s in-app shopping feature, when it launched last year. Then the content creator grossed over $100,000 in sales when he hosted a live event on Black Friday and went from skeptic to believer.  Autade is known for sharing tech-related tips and tricks on his TikTok channel, “kaansanity.” He took to TikTok Live for the first time on Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend to promote gadgets like headphones and game consoles. “It was my first time going live, and to make $102,000 in 10 hours was just insane. I didn’t expect it at all,” he said.  Aakaanksh Autade (left) promoted gadgets like the Nintendo Switch via TikTok Live on Cyber Monday. Courtesy Aakaanksh Autade/kaansanity  TikTok Shop allows users to buy and sell products without leaving the app. The sales platform combines entertainment and retail, making it particularly popular among Gen Z buyers, and it continues to grow. It has over 500,000 sellers in the US, including brands like L’Oréal, PacSun and Scrub Daddy.  TikTok Shop raked in $100 million in single-day sales this Black Friday — that’s triple the number from 2023, according to the company. Over Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend alone, the shop saw a 165% increase in shoppers year-over-year, according to a statement by the company this month.  However, a US appeals court this month upheld a law that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 or face a US ban.  That ban could grind the sales platform’s progress to a halt — but creators who spoke to CNN say that they’re sticking with TikTok Shop anyway because they don’t think a ban will actually happen.  “I don’t think TikTok is going anywhere. I think they’re going to figure it out, and there’s so many people invested in TikTok,” Autade said. “It’s hard to ignore how much it means to its users.”  What makes TikTok Shop tick?  TikTok Shop provides a pipeline from discovery to purchase by letting users shop products featured in live videos, pinned on brand and influencer profiles, or tagged in content shown on their algorithm-driven For You page.  Even before the launch of its shopping feature, TikTok had already established a reputation as a place for users to find items to add to their wishlists. A study conducted in 2022 by marketing consulting firm Material Plus found that 61% of users purchased an item after seeing content about it on TikTok, helped by hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which has over 12 million posts.  Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and TikTok creator, said combining passive entertainment with a shopping function can tempt users to open their wallets.  “You’ve got all these people who are spending so much time just being (on TikTok) consuming and creating content,” she said. “When you mix in commerce with our favorite source of entertainment, then we’re going to spend all our money there.”  TikTok Shop’s reliance on user-generated content allows consumers to hear from voices they trust.  Lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk says TikTok Shop's main draw is its ability to let consumers see their favorite influencers use the products they promote in real time. Courtesy Carrie Berk  Social media strategist Keenya Kelly says that TikTok Shop is another avenue for content creators to make money on TikTok without having to leave the app. Courtesy Keenya Kelly  “If you see your favorite creator promoting a product on a live stream or a video, you’re more likely to buy it in that moment,” said Carrie Berk, a lifestyle content creator. The thinking among viewers, she said, is that “if a makeup influencer is promoting a product on TikTok Shop, if she says it’s good, then it must be good.”  TikTok users like Autade also say that the app’s focus on short-form videos gives it an edge over other social media platforms.  “When I click on a product and I can see hundreds or even thousands of people posting a video about that product authentically, that really helps,” he said. “On a different platform, I might just see some words, some reviews, some stars here and there,” but seeing the product in action is different.  Another component of TikTok Shop’s growth is its popularity with younger users. Some 62% of Gen Z consumers say that TikTok is their platform of choice when they need to look something up, beating out search engines like Google, according to a report by marketing technology company SOCi published this year.  “Gen Z as a whole has really chosen TikTok as their premier destination for content,” said Jen Jones, chief marketing officer of e-commerce platform Commercetools. “TikTok shop just seemed like a natural place for those dollars to be spent.”  What would a TikTok ban mean for other social media retail platforms?  Social media shopping is not a new phenomenon.  Ninety-two percent of retailers plan to invest more in social commerce this holiday season, according to a study by Commercetools published in October. The same study showed that Facebook Marketplace was the social commerce platform of choice for businesses, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok Shop and X.  In particular, Jones sees an opportunity for YouTube to fill in the space TikTok could leave behind if a ban comes into force.  She says that YouTube could potentially meet demand for the style of short-form videos popularized by TikTok through YouTube Shorts while capitalizing on its longer-form content.  In the past year alone, people watched over 30 billion hours of shopping-related content on YouTube, the company previously told CNN in an email. In 2023, it launched YouTube Shopping, allowing content creators to tag products from brands featured in their videos and earn commissions.  Experts say that if the TikTok ban happens, it will serve as a lesson for brands to not put all their eggs into one marketing basket.  The Shop tab of the TikTok app is seen on an iPhone on June 23 in Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images  “It’s just really important for companies to have a very diversified strategy when it comes to social shopping,” said Jones. “We know that social shopping is here to stay. You can’t get locked into just one platform.”  Kelly says the same advice applies to individual content creators who make money off their posts and videos, and recommends cultivating a following through more direct forms of outreach like email lists.  “We use social media to reach a group of people,” she said. “You need to pull those people off social media onto email so that you have control over your business.”  Still, Kelly says she sees no reason for content creators to be concerned over the court ruling that moves TikTok one step closer to a ban.  “I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, she said. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.”  Berk commands an audience of almost 4 million followers on TikTok and describes the social media platform as a big part of her livelihood, but she says she’s not worried by the prospect of a total ban next month.  “There has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical,” she said.  Autade still has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, but he told CNN that TikTok was his primary marketing avenue and the platform that has brought him the most success.  Even as the threat of a ban looms nearer, he says it’s still business as usual and plans to continue with a live event in January similar to the one he hosted on Black Friday.  “I’m still all-in on TikTok. I’m still living my day-to-day life, running my businesses, and everything’s pretty much the same until I hear otherwise,” Autade said.",US,TikTok Shop was going to be the next big thing.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked.",US,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,,,,0.021,0.948,0.031,0.2114
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/sony-stock-record/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,,"CNN —  The last time Sony was worth this much on the stock market, Bill Clinton was president and the PlayStation 2 was about to debut on American store shelves.  It’s been a rough past two and a half decades for Sony, the 78-year-old company that invented the Walkman and the PlayStation and had long been an icon of consumer electronics. It largely missed the boat on the mobile phone revolution, and while the PlayStation has been profitable, production costs for other electronics have risen while demand has softened.  But as opportunities arise in streaming, Sony is trying to transition from being a legacy consumer electronics company to an original content and entertainment company.  The strategy is working: In the past three years, Sony’s stock (SONY) has started to break out of a decades-long slump. Sony’s stock price in Japan recently closed at the first record high since March 2000, signifying confidence in the company’s ability to evolve its game offerings and steer itself toward entertainment, Damian Thong, a research equity analyst at Macquarie, told CNN.  “If you went back 30 years ago, it was an electronics company, so best known as a seller of hardware,” Thong said. “But today, the company is primarily generating profits off of entertainment, which is games, music and (TV and movies).”  Less hardware, more content  Sony Group, Japan’s third largest company by market value, has turned itself around by innovating its games business beyond consoles and making acquisitions to expand its IP, Joost van Dreunen, an adjunct assistant professor at NYU Stern who teaches the business of video games, told CNN.  Sony acquired Anime powerhouse Crunchyroll in 2021, and it acquired American video game company Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion.  In addition to Sony Interactive Entertainment, which makes the PlayStation, the behemoth Sony Group also includes Sony Pictures, which produces films like the Spider-Man series, and Sony Music, which includes Columbia Records.  Sony is trying to unlock synergy across its subsidiary companies to produce original entertainment content for consumers, van Dreunen said.  Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal in the first season of ""The Last of Us."" Liane Hentscher/HBO  That strategy of leveraging its intellectual property across its brands became apparent at the 75th Emmy Awards in January, when the TV series “The Last of Us” won eight primetime awards. It was the first time a TV show adapted from a videogame earned major consideration at a Hollywood awards ceremony.  It was a momentous occasion for Sony, which first published “The Last of Us” as a videogame in 2013 before it was adapted to become a TV series released in 2023 on HBO and Max. (HBO and Max share ownership with CNN.)  Without a streaming network of its own, licensing its intellectual property and original content is part of Sony’s strategy to compete with streaming giants like Netflix, Disney and Amazon.  Robert Lawson, the chief communications officer for Sony Group, said in a statement that since 2018 when the company acquired EMI publishing, making Sony Music the world’s largest publisher of music, Sony has invested approximately 1.5 trillion yen into content IP across various entertainment businesses.  “Sony Group has shifted its corporate strategies towards strengthening its creation and entertainment assets,” Lawson said, noting the company is focusing on “new collaborations between Sony sister companies,” including leaning heavily into the anime genre.  In the last fiscal year ending March, Sony’s entertainment business, which includes music, movies and games, accounted for 60% of total revenue. That’s double from a decade ago, when the entertainment business accounted for just 30% of total revenue.  A long road to dominance  Doubling down on entertainment represents a departure from Sony’s origins.  Before there was Sony, there was Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, founded in 1946 by Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka. The company released Japan’s first-ever magnetic tape record in 1950. In 1958, the company changed its name to Sony Corporation.  In the 1960s, Sony established its business in the United States. For the next three decades, the Japanese company emerged as a household name in consumer electronics, producing iconic devices from the Trinitron color TV in 1968 to the Walkman cassette player in 1979 to the world’s first CD player in 1982, in addition to numerous cameras and video recorders.  Sony has also been involved with music since the 1960s through a joint venture with CBS that became Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Yet it’s largely been known for its electronics.

Aflo/Shutterstock  The 1990s were a high point for Sony as it broke into the world of gaming consoles. With the release of the PlayStation in 1994, Sony disrupted the arcade and gaming industry.  Since the 1990s, Sony has been a dominant player in the videogame console business with iterations of the PlayStation. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, which has consistently outsold its main competitors like Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Nintendo’s Switch, according to data from Ampere Analysis, an analytics firm for the games business.  Van Dreunen said that Sony is also looking to evolve in gaming beyond its console business, looking for new audiences and methods of distribution.  “We’re currently going through a softer period in gaming, and so it really raises the stakes for companies like, what’s next?” he said. “How do you as the dominant console maker continue to innovate and continue to grow your business?”  An original PlayStation is pictured at a display of various memorabilia in the lobby of the Sony headquarters building in central Tokyo on November 27, 2024.

Brooks/AFP/Getty Images  A customer walks away after purchasing the new Sony Playstation PS5 in Seoul on November 12, 2020, after Sony launched the new console in select markets around the world. Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images  Thong said that Sony has been successful in becoming a profitable channel for third-party publishers to sell videogames.  Sony has tried to diversify its strategy toward gaming, including publishing a videogame called Helldivers 2 across PlayStation5 and also PC. Helldivers 2 was a hit for Sony and sold over 12 million copies within three months of its release, according to Anna Kerr, a research manager for games at Ampere Analytics.  “The games business is spreading out its IP,” NYU Stern’s van Dreunen said. “It’s looking for new ways to reach customers, to expand that customer reach.”  In November, Sony announced a 69% percent jump in net quarterly profit, driven in part by its game segment. The company has had consistently strong quarters this year, driven by profitability in its games.  The company is now in talks to acquire Kadokawa, a Japanese videogame powerhouse that produces the popular videogame “Elden Ring,” according to people familiar with the matter.  There have been some headwinds: Sony’s rollout of the “Concord” vieogame and Sony Pictures’ latest installment of the Spider-Man universe were largely flops among fans this year. However, they are trial and error runs, van Dreunen said, and manageable expenditures for a company that has denoted 1.8 trillion yen ($11 billion) for acquisitions and stock buybacks through March 2027.  In May, at Sony’s annual investor conference, Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida said that the company was embracing a “creative entertainment vision.”  Sony’s emergence as an entertainment company was not always certain, Thong said.  “Sony had some years of quite substantial pain, I would say,” Thong said. “And I think to their credit, they managed to weather and see through it.”  Bringing Sony IP to the big screen  Van Dreunen said in the past, there wasn’t as much demand for videogame adaptations for movie and TV. Yet “The Last of Us” showed that Sony had an opportunity to bring more Sony IP to the big screen.  Before “The Last of Us,” Sony also tried its hand at videogame adaptation with “Uncharted,” a 2022 movie featuring actor Tom Holland that was based on a video game franchise first published by Sony in 2007.

Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg/Getty Images  Additionally, Sony is planning to adapt videogame franchise “God of War,” which it first published in 2005, to the big screen next year, Kerr said.  Sony is still in the electronics business, Thong said, noting its image sensors business works with companies like Apple and it produces high-end cameras. However, it has shed its identity as a mass consumer electronics company.  In 2025, Sony intends to spin off its online banking and insurance units, further doubling down on its entertainment offerings.

It’s a patchwork built over decades.”  Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.  “Together with employers, governments and others who pay for care, we need to improve how we explain what insurance covers and how decisions are made,” Witty wrote. “Behind each decision lies a comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety.”  Witty also praised UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was killed in midtown Manhattan last week, writing that Thompson “fought for preventive health and quality health outcomes rather than simply adding ever more tests and procedures.”  In a statement on Friday, UnitedHealthcare said “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company’s treatment of insurance claims” and that it “approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission,” noting that “around one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons.”  Will changes be made?  Thompson’s fatal shooting pushed Americans’ dissatisfaction with their health insurance into the spotlight. Many have made their frustrations abundantly clear on social media.  Journalists have also chronicled insurers’ efforts to twist the system to their benefit. STAT, a news site that focuses on health care, has published a series of investigative stories on UnitedHealth, including articles on how the nation’s largest health insurer uses a computer algorithm to cut off rehabilitation care for Medicare enrollees, limiting clinical case managers’ discretion.  Whether the public outcry prompts UnitedHealthcare and other insurers to adjust their practices — particularly the much-maligned denials of treatment and claims — or pushes lawmakers to force the industry to make changes remains to be seen. It depends, in part, on whether patients continue making their voices heard, experts say.  Angry consumers have had success in overhauling the health insurance industry in the past. They railed against the restrictions of health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, in the 1990s, as captured in the 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” That helped spur insurers to offer more preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, which have fewer constraints but are more costly.  Any shifts in the nation’s complex health care system, however, will not come easily, nor quickly, experts say. There are many players involved, each of which has its own patient care concerns, financial interests and lobbying dollars to influence lawmakers.  UnitedHealthcare’s mission  While many patients and their advocates argue that insurers deny care to pad their profits, the industry maintains that it is protecting consumers from high prices and unnecessary care.  Soon after Thompson’s murder, Witty vowed in an internal message to employees to continue the insurer’s mission of helping “the system improve.”  “Our role is a critical role, and we make sure that care is safe, appropriate, and it’s delivered when people need it,” said Witty in a video message obtained by CNN. “And we guard against the pressures that exist for unsafe care or for unnecessary care to be delivered in a way which makes the whole system too complex and ultimately unsustainable. So we’re going to continue to make that case.”  “What we know to be true is that the health system needs a company like UnitedHealth Group,” he continued.  Asked Thursday whether it will make any changes in response to consumers’ public complaints, UnitedHealthcare referred CNN to Witty’s video. Other major insurers either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment, but a leading industry association said that hospitals, providers and employers all have “a direct impact on the cost and accessibility of medical services.”  “In the fragmented and heavily regulated health care system, health plans, providers and drugmakers share a responsibility to make high-quality care as affordable as possible and easier to navigate for the people we collectively serve,” AHIP, the trade group, said in a statement. “Health plans are working to protect patients from the full impact of rising costs while connecting them to care that is safe, evidence-based and coordinated.”  But the recent events may prompt insurers to investigate their practices and make some changes, Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in an email to CNN. This is especially likely if they see risks to their businesses, such as if employers threaten to leave because coverage decisions are too onerous for their workers.  On the flip side, “the main reason to not change their practices is to maintain their profitability while also keeping costs reasonable in a broad sense for their clients and end users,” Utterback wrote.

Hear why. 01:43 - Source: CNN  The HMO backlash  Though former President Bill Clinton failed to reform health care in the early 1990s, his administration’s efforts spurred increased concerns over the cost of care. That cued the growth of the HMO model, which allowed policyholders to see only certain doctors and required referrals from primary care physicians to see specialists and get certain tests and procedures. But HMOs also typically featured low premiums, low or no co-pays and no deductibles.  Policyholders rebelled because they felt they couldn’t access the care they needed, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.  Their angst was captured in extensive media coverage and in the 1997 film “As Good As It Gets,” when a young boy’s mother (played by Helen Hunt) tells a doctor (played by Harold Ramis) that her insurer would not cover an allergy test for her son’s asthma.  “F**king HMO, bastard pieces of sh*t,” Hunt says, before apologizing.  “That’s ok. Actually, I think that’s their technical name,” Ramis replies.  Many states responded to the complaints by passing patients’ bills of rights that limited HMO cost-control practices in state-regulated plans. Employers, who were hearing from angry workers, began shifting to PPOs, which generally provide coverage for a wider range of doctors but have much higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. PPOs have now largely eclipsed the managed care model.  But as health care costs continue to skyrocket, PPOs are instituting practices that resemble those of HMOs, particularly requiring approval of care in advance, known as prior authorization, Levitt said.  “If you think health care costs are rough now, imagine them without constraints,” said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+, a health care consulting group, and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.  Health insurers, however, do at times backtrack when faced with intense blowback. Earlier this month, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield halted its plan to limit the amount of time it would cover anesthesia used in surgeries and procedures after criticism from doctors and politicians. The policy was designed to reduce overbilling and make care more affordable, the insurer had said.  Efforts in Congress  Congress has tried for years to improve access to care and curtail costs, which are far higher in the US than in its peers even though it ranks last on key health measures. Lawmakers have held hearings and introduced bills, but there haven’t been comprehensive reforms enacted since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 — aside from several significant Medicare drug cost provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.  An effort to improve the prior authorization process in Medicare Advantage plans failed to advance in the Senate in 2022 after the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost about $16 billion over a decade.  However, there is now more bipartisan appetite on Capitol Hill to enact reforms, said Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive and vocal critic of the health care industry. Lawmakers reintroduced the prior authorization bill, which now comes with a zero cost estimate, and released a framework to establish so-called site-neutral payments in Medicare, under which Medicare would pay the same rate for a service provided in a hospital outpatient department, an ambulatory surgical center or physician’s office.  Plus, lawmakers are looking at reforms to the pharmacy benefit manager industry, which serves as a middleman between health insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers.  Republicans, who will control Congress starting in January, will be looking for cost savings to offset extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Whitlock said. That could push them to pass measures that would save the government money, such as site-neutral payments.  Meanwhile, the murder of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO will remain in the news as the case against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, winds its way through the court system. That will keep public frustration with health insurers in the spotlight – and could help advance legislation on Capitol Hill, Potter said.  “It will be a years long fight, but it’s going to happen,” he said. “Some kind of reform is inevitable.”",US,UnitedHealth Group CEO: America’s health system is poorly designed,,,,0.082,0.791,0.127,0.9982

If you’re an avid traveler, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your passport fill up with stamps, turning that once-blank travel document into a nostalgic little memory book.  But as delightful as it is to have a paper trail of evidence of your past adventures, your large stamp collection could lead to issues on future trips if you don’t pay close attention. That’s all due to a passport validity rule that many people overlook.  Advertisement  “One rule many travelers miss is needing an adequate number of blank pages in their passport for visas, and entry and exit stamps,” David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com, told HuffPost. “This is often forgotten, especially by those with passports close to expiring or having only a few blank pages.”  The U.S. State Department did not set the blank pages rule, which stems from other countries’ requirements for international visitors.  “Some countries require passports to have at least two to four blank visa or stamp pages, and thus, some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met,” said Caroline Tanner, a trends writer at The Points Guy.  Advertisement  Just as travelers often need to have at least three to six months of passport validity beyond the dates of an international trip, they may also need to have a certain number of empty pages depending on the requirements at their destination.  “The basis for this rule is maintaining proper security measures and part of the entry and exit requirements,” Alwadish said. “Not meeting this requirement can cause problems at borders. If the traveler does not have the required blank pages in the passport, the passport will technically be invalid and the person may not be allowed to board the plane.”  He emphasized that airlines can bar passengers who do not meet the requirement from boarding their flights to avoid complications at the international destination.  Advertisement  “If for whatever reason it is overlooked in the U.S., the traveler may take a big risk once they arrive at their destination country, as every border patrol officer has the right to determine the outcome,” Alwadish explained. “They may have travelers detained, pay a fine or let them pass.”  Taking that kind of risk in a foreign country is not advisable, he added. And there’s a long list of countries that have this rule in place. Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Germany, India, Belgium, South Africa, the Netherlands, Cuba, Iceland, Zimbabwe and Indonesia are among the destinations that require two blank pages. Countries that require one page include France, Japan, Mexico, Greece, Thailand, Australia, Morocco, Argentina and Vietnam, among others. But you’ll need at least three blank pages if you want to visit Namibia, Botswana, Madagascar and Zambia.  “While some pages may be full of stamps, others might have one ― and just one stamp means that that page is not empty,” Alwadish cautioned.  Advertisement  Immigration authorities in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have also emphasized that the “endorsement” pages found at the back of many passports are different from visa pages and thus do not count as blank pages for the purposes of entry and exit stamps. (Newer passports have the endorsement section closer to the front.)  Meanwhile, Armenia and Micronesia have no stated blank passport page requirements.  “Countries like Sweden and the Philippines don’t require a blank page on your passport, but rather sufficient space for entry and exit stamps,” Alwadish noted.  He recommended looking at the State Department’s website for a breakdown of the specific entry prerequisites for each country.  Advertisement  Jake Wyman via Getty Images Many avid travelers delight in their extensive collections of passport stamps, but it's important to check the blank page requirements before visiting an international destination.  Keep in mind that blank page rules don’t just apply to U.S. visitors, either.  “This is true for all incoming travelers to the country, regardless of nationality, based on requirements set by individual countries for incoming visitors,” Tanner said.  Over time, frequent travelers may not need to worry as much about having enough empty passport pages.  Advertisement  “The issue of blank passport pages will likely become less of a significant problem for travelers as more countries are phasing out manual stamping of physical passport books,” Alwadish said. “The European Union is spearheading this shift with the introduction of the Entry/Exit System, intended to expedite the border control process and improve data accuracy.”  He explained that this new system uses biometric technology to scan travelers’ fingerprints and faces at border checkpoints.  “This data will then be stored and used to verify their arrival and exits, cross referenced with their passport information, removing the necessity for physical passport stamps,” he said.  Advertisement  But for now, immigration officers still need to ensure there are enough pages for stamps and visas. So travelers must remain vigilant.  “It is always best to make sure your passport is valid and has at least two blank pages,” Alwadish noted. “If a traveler does not have enough blank pages available, they cannot add more to their physical book.”  As of 2016, the U.S. government does not allow travelers to add extra pages to their existing passports. If they need more pages, they must renew their passports.  Advertisement  People who often travel internationally might want to consider choosing the option for a bigger passport with more visa pages. It’s no extra cost, and all you have to do is check the box that says “large book” when you fill out the form.  If you have an impending trip abroad, there are ways to get a new passport in a rush on your own or by paying a third party for expedited service. And of course, the best way to avoid adding extra stress and hassle is to keep track of your passport and ensure it’s compliant throughout the year.",US,The 1 Big Mistake You Should Avoid With Your Passport,,,,0.049,0.874,0.077,0.9863
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/queef-vagina-fart-flatulence-sex-ano_l_675ca50fe4b08821cba78ed8,Huffington Post,neutral,Trending,,"Cavan Images via Getty Images Flatulence from your vagina during sex or physical activities like yoga is common and nothing to be ashamed of.  Queefing, as anyone with a vagina will tell you, can happen at some inopportune times: while you’re having sex, in the middle of a yoga class or during a visit to the gynecologist.  You may have heard some people refer to queefs as “vaginal farts” (charming). But while queefs do produce a toot-like sound, we can assure you that queefing is not the same as passing gas.  Advertisement  We talked to gynecologists and sex therapists to learn more about what causes queefs, some of the misconceptions about them and why they shouldn’t be as mortifying as we make them out to be.  What makes you queef, anyway?  Queefing is an involuntary bodily function that occurs when air is pushed into the vagina, gets temporarily trapped in the folds of the vaginal canal (called rugae) and is then released.  Advertisement  “Queefing happens when a penis, fingers or sex toy go in and out of the vagina bringing additional air along with it,” Sherry A. Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, California and the author of “She-ology: The Definitive Guide to Women’s Intimate Health,” told HuffPost. “Sex can involve a lot of thrusting of the penis in and out of the vagina, typically pushing extra air into a dead-end space.”  Certain sex positions, like doggy style where your pelvis is titled upwards, or abruptly switching from one position to another, may increase the likelihood of queefing. Even non-sexual activities, like putting in a tampon or menstrual cup, practicing yoga (like when you move out of an inversion pose) or your gyno inserting a speculum can lead to queefing.  “From my experience as an OB-GYN, almost every woman has experienced at least one episode of queefing some time during her life, sometimes even during a pelvic exam,” said Diana Hoppe, an OB-GYN in Encinitas, California.  While the gas that comes out of your rectum may have a foul odor (a result of bacterial activity in the gut), queefs are odorless, Hoppe added.  Advertisement  Can you prevent a queef?  And as OB-GYN Sheila Loanzon told Cosmopolitan, “If you try to contract the vaginal canal to prevent air from coming in, it can cause sex to be more painful.”  Advertisement  “Also, when doing any abdominal exercises or weight-bearing exercise, it is important to squeeze the pelvic floor while holding the core abdominal muscles tight,” Hoppe said. “Many women squeeze abdominal muscles but do not activate the pelvic floor at the same time, thus allowing the pelvic floor to sag, increasing the likelihood of air entering into vaginal canal.”  During sex, keeping the penis, fingers or sex toy inside you while you change positions could lessen your chances of queefing because it “gives air less of an opportunity to get into the vagina,” Jamil Abdur-Rahman, an OB-GYN and the chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vista Health System in Waukegan, Illinois, told Self.  Advertisement  And in theory, you could just avoid certain sex or yoga positions altogether. But what’s the fun in that?  When queefing does happen, don’t sweat it.  So why does this very normal bodily function feel so embarrassing in the moment, be it during doggy-style or downward dog? It really just comes down to that pesky noise, Hoppe said.  “The stigma is due to lack of understanding the difference between release of air from the vagina and flatulence,” she said. “The sound effects may be the same though, so culturally there may be a stigma or embarrassment due to this occurring ‘down there.’”  Advertisement  Sex therapist Vanessa Marin underscored the fact that queefing is normal, common and “not anything to be ashamed of.” Embracing the awkwardness of the moment can even make sex more enjoyable for both partners.  “Our bodies make funny noises sometimes, and that’s OK!” she said. “Plus, there are plenty of other goofy things about sex, like getting sweaty, slipping out, getting into awkward positions and so on. The more we can laugh about these kinds of things, the more fun we’ll have during sex.”  When a queef slips out mid-coitus, you have two choices: ignore that deflating balloon sound completely or quickly acknowledge it and move on. Marin prefers the latter route.  Advertisement  “It’s a personal preference, but I think it’s better to just quickly acknowledge it and laugh it off,” she said. “That way you don’t have to sit there thinking about it, anxiously wondering whether or not your partner heard it.”  Is queefing ever cause for concern?  Generally, queefing is nothing to be worried about. While rare, if queefing is accompanied by pain or a bad smell, you should make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any more serious issues.  “If queefing is associated with a foul odor, it may be an indication of a vaginal infection or possible fistula, an [abnormal] connection between rectum and vagina due to previous radiation treatment or surgery that causes stool or feces to come out of the vagina,” Hoppe said.  Advertisement  But for the most part, queefing is a normal, if slightly awkward, fact of life. So let’s not get so hung up on it, OK?",US,"Here’s Why You Queef During Sex.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

(AP) — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.  Advertisement  This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what’s behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  More drone sightings have been reported in New York City, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials. And then President-elect Donald Trump posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  This photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. (Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.  Advertisement  “Whether or not it’s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I’m saying is it’s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,” he added.  ___",US,"Drone Mystery Grows As Flying Object Sightings Continue In New Jersey, Other States",,,,0.058,0.868,0.074,0.9502

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

Left: Amazon MGM Studios; Right: Roadside Attractions  Unless folks are doing something like recording whole scenes of a movie on their cellphones, you generally don’t notice who else is in the audience with you at a movie theater. The lights fade to black, the screen brightens and everything — and everyone — around you virtually disappears. But sometimes taking stock of how others react to a film can tell you a lot about who becomes the arbiters of merit and why.  That’s especially true when you’re watching a Black movie.  An example that comes to mind is “12 Years a Slave,” which tells the harrowing true story of a free Black man who was abducted and sold into slavery in 1841. At a 2013 press screening for the film in Manhattan, an inclusive audience sat transfixed in front of the screen during multiple scenes of sexual and physical violence.  Advertisement  Perusing the theater during those moments revealed something interesting. Some Black viewers were stone-faced, while others seemed exhausted by the second or third brutality scene. Many of the white folks, though, were inconsolable — sobbing and blowing their noses. Perhaps that was on account of white guilt, a performative impulse, or because the film really is that stirring.  In any case, “12 Years a Slave,” a Steve McQueen-directed movie that unflinchingly portrays the horrors of white supremacy, was heralded by a predominantly white and so-called liberal Hollywood elite. And it went on to earn nine Oscar nominations.  There was another staggering Black drama released that same year that was also a nonfiction story dealing with systemic racism, though in a more modern context: “Fruitvale Station.” It earned exactly zero nominations from that same voting branch.  Advertisement  While the Ryan Coogler-directed film can hardly be accused of not engaging with the issue of whiteness through the lens of police brutality, there is a crucial difference between it and the aforementioned offering. It does not hinge on the racially motivated atrocity against its lead character or its perpetrator. Rather, it centers the Black human life that was cut short. It examines who the person was outside of the system of whiteness.  Ethan Herisse (left) and Brandon Wilson in ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  In essence, it’s not a film that necessarily brings white audiences into its story. It actually seems indifferent to whatever reaction they might have. A Hollywood voting establishment that, in spite of all its lip service, has always had an issue appreciating art that does not revolve around their lives or even their ills could see that as a detriment.  Advertisement  They often look for art they can laud that can at least give the appearance that they’re progressive despite showing all signs of the opposite. It’s a self-gratifying tactic that doesn’t serve the art at all, no matter how good it is.  It’s been over a decade since “12 Years a Slave” and “Fruitvale Station” were released, and white people’s proximity to a Black narrative still weighs heavily on their acclaim for it. This year’s “Nickel Boys” and “Exhibiting Forgiveness” are two other Black films that have had parallel journeys to the big screen and awards season. But their trajectories could not be more different — and for the same reason as their predecessors.  Similar to “12 Years a Slave,” “Nickel Boys,” an adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, is an unrelenting drama following the lives of two young Black men trying to survive an abusive and racist reform school in the 1960s. The performances are good. The movie’s technical merit, including its marvelous cinematography, has already helped it earn the attention of several awards bodies.  Advertisement  Despite it not even being released in limited theaters until Friday, there’s hardly a day that goes by in the last few months — since its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival this summer — that there isn’t press or hype about it. That includes numerous press screenings and initiatives.  But with the effects of systemic oppression being an impeding factor of the story, leaving little space to explore the characters’ humanity, it’s hard not to again wonder whether its appeal to arbitrated audiences is also that it is more for them to appreciate than others who might identify with their experiences.  André Holland (left) and Andra Day in ""Exhibiting Forgiveness."" Courtesy of Roadside Attractions  Advertisement  Director RaMell Ross said he didn’t intend for that to be the case, though. When the filmmaker was asked in an interview with Vanity Fair what his expectations are of audiences that are “older, very white and wealthier,” he replied that “Nickel Boys” “emerges from our centrality, and it ostensibly is for us, but I’m happy to give it to others.”  “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” on the other hand, doesn’t provoke that same question. It almost entirely wrestles with the complexities of its Black characters, and in ways Black audiences especially recognize. Systemic prejudices are understood as the reality in which they live, only because they are Black and it’s set in the present day, not because the plot informs that. There’s nary a moment when the film even gestures toward that to tell its story.  That helps create an intensely insulated film that centers a Black family whose drama is also deeply felt and astoundingly performed. The conflicts, joy and contradictions that propel the plot are of their own making — and not the result of a racially motivated antagonist. White people, come to think of it, are merely ornamental in the story.  Advertisement  It is unequivocally a film by and for Black people to grapple with among ourselves — one that has similarly affected Black audiences in the way “12 Years a Slave” moved white viewers. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” allows white audiences to enter its narrative incidentally only, while films like “Nickel Boys” and “12 Years a Slave” often engage directly with their white audiences through their own historical (and present-day) examination.  It’s a distinction that often results in the latter films being considered worthy of Hollywood’s highest honors.  Taking a look at the theatrical and post-theatrical odysseys of “Exhibiting Forgiveness” and “Nickel Boys” might help bring this into further focus. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is an original story that was amazingly green-lit in our sequel- and adaptation-obsessed culture and based on the personal experiences of writer-director Titus Kaphar, a first-time feature filmmaker.  Advertisement  “Nickel Boys” came with all the fanfare of a known author, an acclaimed literary honor under its belt and at least the assumption that its Jim Crow-era setting means that whiteness could obviously play a significant role in the story. Even Ross’ avant-garde filmmaking that shifts the camera and perspective between the two lead characters couldn’t deter an audience that was already locked in.  Herisse stars as Elwood in a moment from ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  Ross also told Vanity Fair that the process between the film being green-lit and going into production through Orion Pictures and Amazon MGM Studios was fairly smooth, to his own surprise. And since its Telluride premiere just a few months ago, “Nickel Boys” has experienced a constant whirlwind of praise from various awards bodies and audiences.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, Kaphar told me during an interview that “it was a fight” to get “Exhibiting Forgiveness” released in theaters. Like many filmmakers, especially Black filmmakers whose work is too often considered niche, Kaphar was approached about bringing the film to a streaming service.  Despite earning rave reviews following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it went months without being acquired, and then months later — not until October — it was released by Roadside Attractions. By then, many people had forgotten about it or just hadn’t heard much about it at all.  Save from a video-on-demand release and awards screeners available to voting press, the film hasn’t been able to achieve any major award nominations and hasn’t popped up on most “best of 2024” lists. (It made HuffPost’s roundup.) Unlike “Fruitvale Station,” it also failed to earn an Independent Spirit Award nomination or other award precursor nominations.  Advertisement  None of this discussion is to elevate any one Black film above another, suggest that a certain kind of Black film is better than the next, or even pit two films against each other. Both can and should be in the conversation. It is to question the deciding bodies that dictate the merit of Black films and have an honest conversation about what actually motivates their choices.",US,‘Nickel Boys’ And ‘Exhibiting Forgiveness’: A Tale Of 2 Black Films,,,,0.073,0.793,0.134,0.9984

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

(AP Photo/Zurab Tsertsvadze) via Associated Press  Who is the outgoing president?  Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads.

(South Korean Presidential Office/Yonhap via AP) via AP  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s parliament on Saturday impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his stunning and short-lived martial law decree, a move that ended days of political paralysis but set up an intense debate over Yoon’s fate, as jubilant crowds roared to celebrate another defiant moment in the country’s resilient democracy.  The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85. Yoon’s presidential powers and duties were subsequently suspended and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s No. 2 official, took over presidential powers later Saturday.  Advertisement  The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he’s thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon’s impeachment after ruling party lawmakers boycotted it last Saturday. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon’s impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon’s impeachment was an outcome driven by “the people’s ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.”  Advertisement  Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, “We have preserved the constitutional order!”  In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached.

Advertisement  Han, who became the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han’s office.  South Korea’s executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade and finance and was the ambassador to the U.S. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.  Advertisement  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred.  Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law.  The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon “committed rebellion that hurts peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.” It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.  Advertisement  Yoon remains defiant  In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon had rejected the rebellion charges, calling his order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it “a monster” and “anti-state forces” that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.  Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a “mad declaration of war” against his own people.  Observers say Yoon’s speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon’s approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.  Advertisement  Some of Yoon’s claims don’t align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.  Most notably, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that after martial law was announced, Yoon called him and asked for his troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he didn’t carry out Yoon’s orders.  Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.  Advertisement  In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers. Roh jumped to his death in 2009, after he had left office, amid a corruption scandal involving his family.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea.  He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested.

If the news these days overwhelms you, you’re hardly alone: America is as politically polarized as ever. Almost every day, there’s a new controversial Cabinet pick from President-elect Donald Trump. There are drawn-out wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and here in the U.S., some say we’re on the edge of a looming class war.  In short, we are living in bizarre, capital-letter Unprecedented Times. If you’re able to block it all out and not take on the stress, you’re lucky.  Advertisement  A week after Trump won the election, independent journalist Marisa Kabas wrote on Bluesky about how frenzied the news cycle makes her feel.  “There has to be a better way than sounding an alarm every single time a deranged Trump-related story drops,” she said. “It’s unhealthy and unsustainable. We need to find a way to stay informed without spiking cortisol and without losing sight of the bigger picture. I’m just...not sure how.”  Advertisement  A month later, Kabas says she’s still considering this question.  “When there’s a deluge of really intense news, I know my instinct is often ‘make it stop.’ But since I know the news is never going to stop, I’ve been trying in those moments to think instead of momentarily putting it aside,” said Kabas, who publishes The Handbasket, a newsletter about politics, media and power.  Advertisement  Kabas think people need to remind themselves that just because news is available to them at all times doesn’t mean they’re required to consume it. You can gauge your personal limit and clock out when you need to.  “This isn’t to say ignorance is bliss; at this really scary moment in history, some tolerance for distress is required to avoid being complicit in allowing this country to passively slide all the way into fascism,” she told HuffPost. “But if you’re overwhelmed, choose a few outlets you trust and read them as often as you find tolerable.”  What other steps can you take to manage the emotional impact stressful news has on you?

For me, that often looks like hitting a local trail with my queer chosen family. We hike, talk and hold space for each other as we navigate these challenging times. It’s a reminder that even in uncertainty, we have the power to create moments of connection and care.

Advertisement  Choose a few issues you’re interested in and keep your news intake limited to those.  “One approach is to choose an issue or two that matter most to you and stick to news on those topics to avoid the sense that all the news is bad. I’ve found that can be more mentally manageable and also helps you become more learned in specific areas. Win/win.” ― Kabas  Focus on things that bring you joy, give you perspective and that are in your control.  “I step away from the news and focus in on the things in life that bring me joy (my infant son, my wife, our friends and family, music, running), give me perspective (the woods, the ocean, our long history as a resilient and adaptive trans community), and that I can control (how I show up for myself, my family, and my community, and the contributions I make every day in ways big and small to the collective and enduring effort to create a more peaceful and inclusive world).

Instead, I treat the news as a call to solidarity. There are grassroots organizers who are on the front lines of the world’s worst crises.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/should-you-open-bottle-of-wine-host-gift_l_6744ac9be4b0b7647d8a1385,Huffington Post,neutral,Trending,,"Lorenzo Conti For HuffPost  When visiting a friend’s house for dinner or a party, it’s a common tradition to bring a gift for the host. This might be a bouquet of flowers, a scented candle or even a bottle of wine. But sometimes, a gifted item of food or drink can cause miscommunication between hosts and guests.  For instance, if a host thanks their guest for bringing a bottle of wine, but it never appears on the communal bar or dinner table, does that mean the host isn’t happy with the gift?  Advertisement  What are the rules and guidelines around edible and drinkable gifts, and how can hosts clearly communicate their expectations? To answer these questions, we turned to a group of modern etiquette experts and event professionals.  Serving or not serving gifted items is totally up to the host.  The first thing to remember about bringing a gift to a party is that, once given, the gift becomes the sole property of the host, and what happens to it is up to them.  Advertisement  “Host gifts, whether it is a bottle of wine, a handmade food item or a box of candy, are not expected to be opened and offered at the gathering unless the guest and host have discussed it and agreed to do so,” confirmed Renate Devin, the owner of the Boston School of Etiquette.  Jamila Musayeva, a certified etiquette coach and the author of “The Art of Entertaining at Home,” agreed, adding that “when you bring a bottle of wine, homemade cookies or any edible item as a gift, it’s thoughtful to remember that this is a gesture of appreciation, not an expectation for it to be served immediately. Hosts usually have planned their menu and wine selection, so a well-chosen gift is best viewed as something for them to enjoy later, unless they specifically ask you to contribute to the party offerings. It is up to the host to serve or open what the guest has brought because the host is in charge of planning the menu and deciding how and what to serve — particularly pairing of beverages with food.”  So if your friend doesn’t open the bottle of pinot noir that you brought to dinner, don’t take it personally. They’re likely planning to save it for another time!  The host should communicate whether guests are expected to contribute a dish or drink to the party.  Sit-down dinner events and potluck dinners abide by specific rules, but many house parties fall into a nebulous middle ground. Food will be served and the host is planning to provide the mains, but if a guest wants to contribute a side dish or a dessert (or a bottle of vino), the addition is often encouraged.  Advertisement  As a host, providing clear communication can chase away any doubts or misunderstandings about what a guest should bring, or whether they should bring something at all.  “If a host has thoughts or opinions on what guests should bring, they should communicate the expectation in advance,” suggested Melissa Ben-Ishay, the founder and CEO of the company Baked by Melissa. “Oftentimes, when my own guests ask what they can bring, I give them a category. Bring dessert, or bring an adult beverage — this helps the host weave these things into the serving plan.”  You can even be more specific with your guests about which items would be helpful for the meal, said Christine Schaub, the host of “Come on Over,” a web series that is available on YouTube and focuses on home entertaining. Schaub said that such a conversation might go like this: “A pinot grigio would pair beautifully with the salad course. Would you like to bring a bottle?” Then, if the guest asks “for a suggested vintner, be ready with affordable suggestions,” she added.  Advertisement  And if a guest shows up at your door with a gift but you’re not sure whether it’s intended to be shared at the party, Schaub said that you can pick up on some clues from the presentation. “If a beverage arrives in a gift bag, it is truly a gift — not a shareable,” she advised, noting that the same goes for food items.“It’s entirely up to the host whether to serve or save it for another time. If a beverage arrives hot or chilled (in an insulated tote), that’s your tip that [it was intended to] ... be served.”  It might seem tacky to include details about gifts in an invitation (since you as the host may not want guests to think that you expect a present), but Musayeva said there’s a way to express your preferred policy without seeming like a gift-grubber.  “If you’re hosting and prefer not to incorporate gifts into the event’s refreshments, feel free to mention it in a warm and subtle way ahead of time,” Musayeva suggested. “A quick message like ‘Looking forward to seeing everyone! Your presence is the best gift, but if you do bring something special, I’d love to enjoy it later on my own’ makes it clear without any pressure.”  Advertisement  Guests can also take the initiative to ask whether they should bring something.  Hosts have a lot of elements to juggle when preparing for a dinner or a party, so invitation details can sometimes fall by the wayside. If you receive an invite but still aren’t sure whether to bring a dish or a drink, don’t hesitate to shoot the host a quick text message or email.  “It is recommended to ask the host beforehand if one can contribute in any way to the party and what would be most suitable,” Musayeva pointed out. “Perhaps extra portions of cookies or fruits would be appreciated, or beverages. If that is the case, then it is acceptable to assume the host will serve what you brought.”  If you want to give an edible gift while avoiding ambiguity, stay clear of baked goods and wine.  Since gifts like wine and cookie platters could go either way in a “to serve immediately or not?” debate, you might consider a different option to prevent the host from wondering if your offering is meant to be shared.  Advertisement  Shannon Smith, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based private chef and the author of “The Hidden Table,” said possible food and drink gifts may include “gourmet olive oil or balsamic vinegar, artisan chocolates, or infused sea salts or seasonings.” On a similar note, Ben-Ishay said that she likes to “make homemade vanilla extract a year in advance and use that as a gift to bring [to parties]. It always feels extra special when it’s homemade.”  Musayeva noted that “when choosing a gift for a host, keeping their dietary preferences or alcohol choices in mind shows true thoughtfulness. Always bear in mind the religious/cultural background of the host, as alcoholic beverages and foods containing pork or cow meat might not be acceptable.”  A ‘no takebacks’ or ‘no givebacks’ policy always applies to party gifts.  Say a guest brings a bottle of wine to your dinner party, but you already have beverages mapped out for the night. If you’re tempted to hand the bottle back to your guest as they’re leaving, stop right there.  Advertisement  “It would be rude of the host to even attempt to give it back,” said August Abbott, an etiquette expert with the website JustAnswer. “This is a very, very common mistake.” Keep that bottle for later enjoyment (or regifting), but sending it back with the guest who presented it could be viewed as insulting.",US,Is It Rude If Your Dinner Party Host Didn't Open The Bottle Of Wine You Brought?,,,,0.022,0.793,0.186,0.9997

While it’s true that traveling with little ones will be different than what you’re used to, it’s still possible to indulge your wanderlust and explore new places as a family.  As you may have gathered from your paltry parental leave, the U.S. is not always the most welcoming country for families with children. Many other nations show more consideration for kids and parents in both their public policies and their cultural practices.

If you’re itching to roam beyond the U.S. with your kids, here are some recommendations from families with lots of travel experience. Of course, not every part of any country will be suited for kids, but these families were able to find child-friendly spots for making memories.  “The most important thing to remember there is that countries are not monoliths, and some parts of a city may be perfectly safe while others are not,” digital nomad and mom Courtney Orgias told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The Dominican Republic  In addition to a child-friendly culture, the all-inclusive resorts in beachy places like Puerto Plata can simplify life for families traveling with young ones.  “You don’t have to worry about lugging a carseat to multiple places or renting a car. They also typically have toddler pools, kids areas, activities and sometimes childcare. The buffets offer a variety of foods so there’s a good chance you’ll find something the baby/toddler will enjoy. The rooms also typically come with refrigerators for storing the baby’s food and milk,” Stephanie Claytor, founder of the brand Blacktrekking, told HuffPost.  Jamaica  Claytor mentions that similar all-inclusive accommodations, alongside white sand beaches and turquoise Caribbean water, are available in Jamaica.  Advertisement  “We took our son to Negril for his second birthday. Our favorite memory is of him dancing on the beach to reggae music during the all-white party on his birthday. We had no idea he could bust a move. He loved the party and reggae music. We of course were in the back away from the crowded dance floor but were still able to enjoy the DJ,” said Claytor.  She recommends looking for places that offer refrigerators (for breastfeeding parents who need to pump milk), ample shade and outdoor dining — “so that I’m not embarrassed when my son breaks out in loud singing or accidentally throws some food.”  With young children, almost any place can be kid-friendly. “Toddlers and babies are amused by the simplest things such as wood chips and stairways,” Claytor said. So if there’s a destination you’re keen to visit with your little one, you can probably find a way to make it work — just be ready to spend an afternoon collecting rocks instead of devouring your novel in the sun.  Advertisement  “Try to get out of your head any images of long afternoons lounging by the pool sipping cocktails,” said British travel blogger Jenny Lynn. “As a parent traveling with kids you still have to be ‘on,’” she continued. “But traveling provides you with a constantly changing backdrop to take on those daily parent chores, and with new adventures to experience together, daily life becomes all the more rewarding.”  Stephanie Claytor Claytor with her husband and child in Jamaica.  Portugal  “Lisbon can seem intimidating to explore with small kids because of all the hills — nobody wants to carry a toddler or push a stroller up a 30% incline — but we were able to take the bus to most places and found it to be efficient and clean; there were stops everywhere,” said Orgias.  Advertisement  Ample parks and green spaces allowed the kids to get their wiggles out and break up a day of sightseeing, she added.  Mexico  Public transportation also makes Mexico City (Mexico D.F.) more navigable for families, according to Orgias. It “has a great train system we were able to utilize and it’s very walkable, with lots of wonderful neighborhoods that are easy to explore on foot,” she said.  Advertisement  “Worrying about traveling with car seats and hopping in and out of ride shares and taxis is scary for a lot of parents,” she explained, but good public transportation options can allay these concerns.  Costa Rica  If your kids eat rice and beans, they’ll have always something to nosh on with gallo pinto at every meal. Maria De la O of Roam Family Travel told HuffPost that year-round access to fresh fruit also made it easy to keep kids satisfied.  There’s plenty to see, between the jungle and the beach. De la O and her family booked a tour via National Geographic Expeditions with local guides and saw about 20 different animals during their stay.  Advertisement  “We of course stayed in hotels with pools and allowed at least an hour or two a day just for the kids to do that,” she added.  Canada  “The CN Tower, Centre Island and the many summer festivals in the city all present opportunities for novelty, learning and bonding in Toronto. It’s a city with so much cultural diversity that there’s always something to do, indoor & outdoor,” said Orgias.  Advertisement  For animal lovers, Toronto features a zoo and an aquarium. In warmer months, you can take the ferry to Toronto Island Park and enjoy bike trails, picnic areas and even an amusement park. You can also tour Niagara Falls from Toronto.  On the French-Canadian side, Montreal offers plenty of parks, museums and historical sites to keep the whole family occupied. If you’re looking for European-style flair and cobblestone streets, check out Quebec City a bit further north.  Namibia  “Namibia gets our vote as one of the best places for intrepid family travel,” said Lynn, the U.K. travel blogger quoted above. She recommends forgoing an organized tour and instead renting your own 4x4 with roof tents. “The quality of roads is generally very good and the campsites are seriously fantastic (there’s often a pool),” she added.  Advertisement  In addition to “lunar landscapes” and safari wildlife, Namibia offers “a low malaria risk, good health care, German bakeries in every town, and an amazing climate,” Lynn said.  Morocco  “It’s so close to Europe, yet feels a world away with vibrant medinas, sweeping apricot-colored deserts, and jagged snow capped mountains,” Lynn said.  Advertisement  Orgias said some of her favorite memories are of Morocco: “When our kids were 9 months and 3 years we spent Christmas Day riding camels and hiking through the Atlas Mountains in Marrakech. It was such a surreal experience to be able to gift them with these amazing bucket list activities.”  She described Marrakech as “a fast paced city that allows kids and  adults alike to get wrapped up in the blend of rich cultures.”  Lynn said the country is “very doable” by car.  “Kids will love sandboarding in the Sahara Desert, trekking the Atlas Mountains on a mule, or surfing the waves in Essaouira” — a coastal town Lynn found remarkably stroller-friendly.  Advertisement  Thailand  “Thailand is easily one of the most accessible countries we’ve visited with the boys,” said Lynn. Her family enjoyed “the energy, the ornate temples, the colorful markets, the polite people and the food… and of course the incredible beaches!”  Thailand boasts a plethora of street vendors selling delicious snacks. Lynn says her kids enjoyed sticky rice, banana pancakes, mango and other tropical fruits.  Advertisement  “Many restaurants, even along the once-backpacker enclave of Th Khao San, have highchairs, and we found that some beach restaurants in Ko Lanta have toys and kids’ play areas,” she said.  The Netherlands  Orgias recommends Amsterdam for families taking their first journey abroad together, describing it as “safe, clean” and friendly to speakers of English.  Advertisement  “The city is walkable, offers lots of child-friendly museums and activities,” she said.  And if you get the itch to venture out even further, Paris is just a 3.5-hour train ride away!  De la O recommended European destinations in general for travel with a baby. “Pushing a sleeping child in a stroller or walking them in a Baby Bjorn or baby backpack is a perfect way to sightsee, so take advantage of the museums and Gothic churches you won’t be able to enjoy when your child gets a little older.”",US,10 Destinations To Consider For Your Next Family Vacation,,,,0.02,0.82,0.16,0.9998

If you’re a living, breathing human on this planet, chances are that someone, at some point, has urged you to eat your fruits and vegetables. There are good reasons for that: Eating a diet low in fruit and veggies, and high in saturated fats, puts you at risk of developing heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It only makes sense, then, that produce-forward meal plans protect your cardiovascular health. These diets are known to help control risk factors for heart disease like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. (However, medication is necessary sometimes, too.)  Advertisement  The Mediterranean diet is a common heart-healthy approach, but there’s another option that may also be key to lowering your cholesterol and your risk of coronary artery disease: the portfolio diet.  Below, experts share the rundown on this plant-forward meal plan and why it’s worth trying.  What is the portfolio diet?  “The portfolio diet was proposed about 20 years ago, and it has a lot in common with other heart-healthy diets that that you heard of, such as a Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet and a whole food, plant-based diet,” said Dr. Sarah Hull, an associate professor of medicine in cardiology at Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut.  Advertisement  “The name comes from the fact that this diet includes a portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods, so foods that reduce mostly the bad cholesterol in the diet,” noted Kristina Petersen, an associate professor in the department of nutritional sciences at Pennsylvania State University.  The portfolio diet is made up of four different food profiles, Melissa Prest, a clinical nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told HuffPost via email. It encourages the consumption of plant-based protein, plant sterols (a natural compound that helps lower cholesterol levels), soluble fiber and monounsaturated fat.  This means “eating a lot of foods like beans, lentils, soy, nuts and seeds, fruits, vegetables and whole grains as a way to obtain those foods, which basically, again, is very similar to whole food plant-based diet,” Hull said.  Some other heart-healthy diets, like the Mediterranean diet and the DASH eating plan, also include animal products like fish and poultry, and dairy products like yogurt and cheese. But the portfolio diet is vegan — which means if you intend to follow the diet exactly, you’ll need to remove any animal products from your rotation.  Advertisement  The portfolio diet specifically focuses on cholesterol, so it’s a good option if you struggle with that.  According to Petersen, the portfolio diet is not as well-studied as the Mediterranean diet, but the data that is available shows it can significantly benefit your cardiovascular health.  “There have been several studies done where they’ve shown pretty substantial lowering of LDL cholesterol ― so the bad cholesterol that increases risk of heart disease ― with this diet,” Petersen said. “In the original study, the lowering was about 29% in four weeks.”  Advertisement  “And then [researchers] did a subsequent study where they actually compared following this diet with lovastatin, which is a pharmaceutical agent to lower cholesterol, and they actually saw a pretty comparable lowering of LDL,” Petersen said. “So we have quite a bit of evidence that it lowers LDL cholesterol, and this is really what the diet is best known for.”  There are still health rewards even if you just add parts of the portfolio diet to your lifestyle. “Each of the four portfolios can reduce cholesterol levels by 5-10%,” Prest said.  Lowering bad cholesterol is “an important part of preventing and treating cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and stroke,” Hull said.  Advertisement  Research also shows that people who follow the portfolio diet are 14% less likely to develop coronary heart disease and have a stroke, according to the American Heart Association.  There are also other health benefits to the portfolio diet: It’s anti-inflammatory and can help people reach their daily fiber goal (most Americans are fiber deficient), Hull said. Women need between 21 and 25 grams of fiber each day, and men need between 30 and 38 grams daily.  martin-dm via Getty Images Nuts and seeds are a key part of this heart-healthy diet.  Advertisement  Here’s how you can take steps to add the portfolio diet to your lifestyle:  “Thinking about making incremental changes rather than making huge, sweeping changes is one of the most important principles to keep in mind,” Hull said. “So, the first thing is to think about [is], ‘What’s my biggest barrier to incorporating healthy changes?’”  If money is an issue, consider buying frozen fruits and veggies instead of fresh — they’ll last longer and are usually cheaper than the fresh alternative, Hull suggested. Bulk dried legumes, such as beans and lentils, are also more economical, she noted.  If your issue is time, consider meal prepping on the weekends, and look up plant-based, make-ahead recipes. Or if you just don’t know how to prep plant-based meals, consider talking to your doctor or a dietitian.  Advertisement  You can start small by focusing on one meal a day. For example, you could begin by eating oatmeal topped with nuts or seeds for breakfast, Petersen said. Or you could try following the portfolio diet at lunch by making grain bowls with quinoa or brown rice topped with chickpeas, veggies and tofu.  Even just snacking on unsalted nuts, apples and peanut butter, or carrots and hummus is part of this diet, Hull noted.  The portfolio diet still has benefits even if you don’t completely follow it.  Let’s be real: Going from a meat-based diet to a totally vegan meal plan is a big ask. Luckily, you don’t have to go fully vegan to see cardiovascular benefits.  Advertisement  “I think you can still incorporate the key features of the portfolio diet [such as whole grains, nuts, vegetables, beans and fruit] without excluding animal products if you want to include those,” Petersen said. “We have a lot of evidence for viscous fiber, plant sterols, soy and nuts reducing cholesterol levels, so if you just ate more of those foods, you would see cholesterol lowering.”  It’s true that you’ll get the greatest health benefits out of this diet if you follow it to the letter. But even just following it when you can is also good for you.  “The more adherent you can be to a diet like the portfolio diet ― or any predominantly whole food, plant-based diet ― the more benefit you can expect to get in terms of lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as lowering risk of cancer and certain metabolic diseases as well,” Hull said.",US,Want To Lower Your Heart Disease Risk?

The year’s end is approaching and, yet again, I am knee deep in planning a meal that can feed 12 people, finding the right candles that represent my personal brand — whatever that may be — and calculating how many bottles of wine to pick up from Costco without fighting anyone in line.  Similarly to the moments after I gave birth to my first daughter, every year after my annual Christmas party, I whisper to myself, “never again.” And just like that, you have another child, and another holiday party. I adore hosting, but at the end of December, I swear up and down that I’ll never host again, never drink again, and that next year is my time to get those abs I know are hidden somewhere.  Advertisement  I think it is safe to say my closest group of friends enjoys (nay, expects) this annual party. I refuse to disappoint people I love dearly, so I’m elated to host over and over again.  But my guests don’t get off that easy. I expect a few things from my nearest and dearest in regards to a dinner party. Nothing should elicit anyone to clutch their pearls, but if so, hold on tight.  Advertisement  Being fashionably late is applauded.  Promptness is, yes, very important in life. Time is precious, and if someone is wasting that preciousness, that is — to me — punishable by many, many eyerolls and heavy sighs. But in the case of my Christmas party, I’m applauding a 5-to-10-minute delay.  Advertisement  If the invitation states the party begins at 7 p.m., showing up on the dot can be stressful if I’m still basting a turkey or slicing vegetables for a salad (read: reheating chicken cacciatore I bought from a local catering company) so, take a beat between parking your car or getting out of your Uber. Tie your shoe in slow-motion, if need be. A slight delay means your host has a little wiggle room.  Etiquette expert Mariah Grumet, the founder and instructor of Old Soul Etiquette, says using a 10-minute delay is the acceptable thing to do. “For a social event such as a Christmas party, the proper etiquette is to aim to arrive on time or within 10-15 minutes of the invitation time. It would be considered poor etiquette to arrive at someone’s social event early, as you’d want to give your host every last second to put their finishing touches on their event. Beyond 15 minutes would simply be considered late, which is definitely rude to your host! There is a sweet spot, and for your 7 p.m. party, that is 7-7:15 p.m., not 6:59 p.m.”  If you offer to bring something, be specific.  Depending on the level of your party (potluck, family style, fully catered) you might have people ask, “Can I bring anything?” This is a lovely notion, but a conflicting one. While I’d love not to make dessert or put together a salad on top of everything else that needs to be done, I’m not necessarily going to dole out roles for my friends, either. Instead, I’d love someone to just claim a dish. “I make a mean charcuterie board, can I bring that?” would actually alleviate a lot of my stress and financial burden of hosting.  Advertisement  Transferring a piping-hot lasagna might not be in the cards, but a lot of dishes can easily be prepared ahead or, at the very least, out of the host’s way — even if that means cutting cucumbers in a laundry room.  Bring something you’d want to drink, in case the well runs dry.  In conjunction with offering to bring something, if you know other people are drinking alcoholic beverages, you can bring an option to be shared among the guests. Something bottled is the obvious choice: wine, beer or champagne.  Hosting can add up quickly and alcohol is a fairly big factor in that. Contributing to the communal pile is always appreciated. And, if it’s not touched or open, snag it back if you wish!  Advertisement  Olga Pankova via Getty Images Be ready for the hosts to crack open the bottle you gave them at the dinner party; but not everyone will.  While I believe this is absolutely appropriate in a smaller setting and with close friends, etiquette aficionado Mariah Grumet does not: “As a guest, it is absolutely appropriate to ask your host what you can bring when you respond to their invitation. If they ask you to bring something to drink to share, or bring something you enjoy drinking (alcohol or not), by all means, bring it! If no one drinks it, I would advise leaving it as a bonus for your host.  “However, if your host insists that you do not bring anything, you want to respect their wishes. There’s a good chance they planned out their menu and you don’t want to spring something on them that they were not expecting. In this case, it’s best to bring a gift they can open at a later time, such as a festive set of cocktail napkins.”  Advertisement  If you don’t know someone well, please engage.  An under-appreciated stressor in the art of hosting is the omnipresent question, will everyone get along? As a guest who doesn’t know many people, entering a house full of friends sends you right back to the elementary school playground. So let’s put this in writing.  Guests, won’t you please engage in interesting and meaningful conversation with each other?! Inclusion seems to be taught to children and teenagers (or attempted, at the very least), but what about in adulthood? Sit down next to someone you don’t know and engage! Be it the year(s) of COVID isolation, the comfort in the known or laziness, it seems people have stopped engaging in new interactions.  Hanna Ray Flores and Lea Raymond are the duo behind Hauste, a website dedicated to helping you host the best party. They have some enlightening insight into how to make guests feel comfortable during an intimate dinner party. First, “always offer your guest a beverage upon entering. A drink in hand can break the ice and spark comfort,” they said. Always have a few good dinner party questions in your back pocket: “If conversation is falling flat, don’t hesitate to pull out your go-to dinner party questions like, ‘What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?’ or ‘What is your dream dinner party guest list, dead or alive?’ While it may seem silly to have such ice breaker questions, they usually snowball into conversation that isn’t as easy to catch in a bottle.”  Advertisement  I actually don’t want your help cleaning.",US,5 Things I Expect From My Guests When I Host A Party,,,,0.054,0.708,0.238,0.9998

He said he can’t remember the next 20 days.  The Oscar winner, who was in Atlanta when his health scare occurred, explained that the first doctor who saw him gave him a cortisone shot and sent him home. But Foxx’s sister later took him to another hospital after he appeared “lethargic.”  Advertisement  He said that a doctor at the second hospital told his sister that he was “having a brain bleed that led to a stroke,” and that the doctor told her: “If I don’t go in his head right now, we’re going to lose him.”  Foxx said that doctors were able to confirm he was having a stroke after a procedure, but that they weren’t able to determine where the bleeding in his brain was coming from.  The actor said doctors told his sister at the time that he “may be able to make a full recovery,” but that it was going to be “the worst year” of his life.  Foxx woke up on May 4, 2023. “I found myself in a wheelchair,” he said. “I couldn’t walk.”  Foxx’s daughter Corinne Foxx announced in a statement in April last year that her father was recovering after suffering a “medical complication,” though she didn’t divulge further details about the actor’s health condition.

Advertisement  What is a brain bleed?  A brain bleed, or intracranial hemorrhage, is a type of stroke, the brain equivalent of a heart attack. Brain bleeds are a life-threatening medical emergency that causes blood to pool between the brain and skull, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  There are two main areas where brain bleeds can occur, per the clinic’s website: within your skull, but outside of the brain tissue; or inside the brain tissue. They’re caused by “leaky, broken or burst” blood vessels.  This can happen due to several causes, such as head trauma, a blood clot, a brain tumor or a weak spot in a blood vessel wall, among other reasons.  Advertisement  What are the symptoms of a brain bleed?  The symptoms of a brain bleed include a sudden, painful headache that doesn’t go away and gets worse, as well as vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, pupils that are different sizes and paralysis, according to the Mayo Clinic.  How is a brain bleed diagnosed?  Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans and angiograms, are the best ways to determine the size and position of the bleeding.  Treatment for brain bleeds may include medication or surgery. Some brain hemorrhages may not require surgery, depending on the size, cause and location of the hemorrhage, as well as your general health.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-shapewear-bad-for-your-health_l_67575aefe4b0878021580cb4,Huffington Post,neutral,Trending,,"Cat Gwynn via Getty Images  Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Sarah Hyland have admitted to wearing more than one pair of Spanx shapewear at a time to achieve their ideal shape. Similarly, stars and influencers like Kylie Jenner, Jessica Alba, Nicki Minaj and Coco Austin have promoted waist trainers to get an hourglass figure. Beauty may be pain, but at what cost?  HuffPost spoke to six experts, including doctors and physical therapists, about the good and bad of shapewear and corsetry.  Advertisement  How bad is shapewear for your body?  The most common reason people wear shapewear and corsets is to change their body’s shape and smooth out their appearance. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to look your best, but overdoing it can have serious consequences.  “Shapewear isn’t inherently good or bad — it all depends on how you wear it,” said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a chief medical adviser for Garage Gym Reviews.  Advertisement  Bhasha Mukherjee, a general practitioner and medical correspondent in the U.K., said, “I’ll refer to the old saying: The dose decides the poison. It depends on how many hours you’re wearing it, what kind of waist trainer/corset/shapewear you’re wearing, and how tight it is.”  “At the very least, wearing shapewear daily can result in discomfort, but it could also exacerbate anxiety, poor ventilation in the lungs or even musculoskeletal conditions,” said Dr. Michael Masi, a sports doctor and certified personal trainer. “Any body region where movement is repeatedly restricted over prolonged periods is subject to tissue deprivation, where muscles and tendons become weaker and less resistant to stress.”  “Although the use of shapewear might have specific benefits in certain situations, I never recommend them for day-to-day use,” said Darcie Pervier, a women’s health specialist, physical therapist and owner of Newburyport Wellness.    Let’s see all the different bodily functions they can affect.  Breathing/Lungs  “If [shapewear] is too tight and restricting your diaphragm, it can create difficulty breathing, restrict deep breathing and cause shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness,” said Dr. Laura Purdy, a board-certified family medicine physician.    “You don’t often allow enough space for your lungs to expand when taking a deep breath, so you might end up not taking in enough oxygen,” Mukherjee said. You also might struggle to expel all the air from your lungs, leading to a fainting episode (either from too little oxygen or too much carbon dioxide), she explained.  Advertisement  Stomach  “When shapewear puts pressure on your stomach area, it can cause digestive issues like acid reflux and heartburn because of the acid traveling up the esophagus,” said Purdy. It can also detract from the normal rhythm of organ movement, which can “disrupt how well the diaphragm, liver and gut move and shift.”  Bloomberg via Getty Images Kim Kardashian's Skims has upended the underwear industry, surging to almost $1 billion in net sales in 2023.  Compression garments can also cause a hiatal hernial, ”where part of your stomach is forced up and can protrude through a hole (hiatus) in the chest,” said Amy Cooke, a women’s exercise specialist.  Advertisement  Masi has noticed gut issues come up for a lot of his clients when they wear tight-fitting garments for a prolonged time. “The organs are designed to move and expand to accommodate, propel and mechanically digest food. If restricted, people may experience abdominal pain and digestive issues and may cause or exacerbate conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well,” he said.  Pelvic Floor  With shapewear, Mukherjee said, “essentially, you’re putting more and more pressure on the pelvic floor, which then pushes on the pelvic organs. You can sometimes have difficulty controlling your bladder.”  “Pressure from shapewear can cause the bladder, bowel, uterus and rectum to move lower down, increasing the risk of them prolapsing (bulging) into the vagina,” Cooke said.  Advertisement  “I have seen more than one client managing early-stage uterine prolapse use shapewear without realizing it could negatively impact their symptoms. Sadly, this can cause a mild prolapse to become significantly worse,” warned Cooke.  Skin  Depending on how tight the garment is and how long you wear it, you may experience irritation. “It can cause pressure sores on your skin from the pressure of the garment, which can result in skin irritation,” Mukherjee said.  Nerves  “Some people notice that their muscles feel weaker or sore if they wear shapewear all the time, as it keeps your body from moving naturally,” Dasgupta said.  Advertisement  Shapewear can even cause you to go numb: “If shapewear is too tight and is digging into your skin, it can cause numbness from the pressure on the nerve,” Purdy said.  “As a physical therapist, I sometimes see people with symptoms related to peripheral nerve compression, such as tingling or numbness in the thighs — a condition known as meralgia paresthetica. This results from the compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve [a nerve of the thigh],” Masi said.  Are there any positives that shapewear and corsets offer?  It depends. “Worn occasionally, shapewear can smooth out lines under clothes and offer some light support to your back, which might help you stand up straighter,” Dasgupta said.  Advertisement  Mukherjee noted that shapewear and corsetry may be helpful after any abdominal surgery, including pregnancy. “Your abdominal muscles can become weaker, you can get tears in the fibers in between, and that’s why some women after pregnancy have a physiological hernia. Essentially, the wall of the abdomen isn’t very strong, and your inner organs can poke through. Using a waist trainer can prevent hernias and give extra support to those muscles,” she said.  “Some say it helps with posture by activating and supporting your back,” Purdy said, but noted that shapewear may also weaken the back and abs with extended use.  Mukherjee agreed — ribbed corsets force you to sit upright, which can help you avoid slouching. However, a permanent posture change it’s likely related to habit formation rather than the corset itself, she added.  Advertisement  “Shapewear can also give extra support than might be lacking in the abdominal core muscles,” Mukherjee said, and recommended breathable fabrics, like compression garments, that aren’t too tight and can also help with inflammation of scars or burns.  Exercise and waist trainers  How about those waist trainers that you can wear in the gym to sweat more and shape your waist? Thanks to their shape, waist trainers (which should not be confused with weight-lifting trainer belts used to support your back when weight lifting) are essentially corsets.  The experts agreed that wearing waist trainers or other restrictive clothing while exercising should be avoided for various reasons, including sabotaging your workout.  Advertisement  “Physical activity requires a full range of motion, adequate breathing capacity, and proper core engagement. Restricting the diaphragm can lead to shallow breathing and reduced oxygen intake. The added external support of a corset may reduce the intrinsic support from your core, leading to less engagement and less effective exercise,” Masi said.  Plus, wearing something restrictive while working out will make sweat linger on the skin and may also cause skin barrier irritation or fungal growth, Mukherjee noted.  No type of waist trainer helps with weight loss or fat burn. “The garment doesn’t reduce body fat, increase muscle tone or permanently reshape tissues,” Masi said. “Compression garments are not a substitute for exercise, as they don’t effectively engage the core or other muscles in a way that would lead to long-term body shaping.”  Advertisement  How often should one wear shapewear?  “It is important to recognize that wearing shapewear for a night out is just fine as long as you have no other medical issues,” Pervier said.  If you have to wear shapewear or corsets occasionally, you must pick the right size and ensure they aren’t too tight. It shouldn’t be too restrictive, as that’s when issues arise. “The key is wearing shapewear in moderation and in a size that fits you,” Purdy added.

If you have to wait hours to board your delayed flight, can you at least create a little slice of tranquility among the holiday travel chaos with a sheet mask? Or are some of these products at risk of being thrown into the trash at security?  To find out which products are allowed in your carry-on luggage and which you should pack in your checked luggage for holiday travels, HuffPost spoke to Eri Jenkins, a 17-year veteran of the Transportation Security Administration and Uniformed Advisor for TSA Security Operations.  Advertisement  The 411 on TSA’s 3-1-1  If you plan on packing your skin care lotions and potions in your carry-on luggage for your holiday flights, ensure they meet the TSA 3-1-1 rule, with each product packed in a travel-sized container of 3.4 ounces (100 ml) or less. Your products should then fit inside a single 1-quart bag.  Advertisement  While the rules around the carry-on status of your favorite liquid serums and gel night creams are relatively straightforward, some other products might leave travelers scratching their heads as to whether or not the 3-1-1 rule applies.  Cleansing Balms and Jellies  As a good rule of thumb, Jenkins recommends that if you can spread, rub or spray the skin care item, it should adhere to the TSA 3-1-1 rule if you want to pack it into your carry-on luggage.  So if you plan on wowing your family and friends with your favorite cleansing balm at the next big holiday gathering, ensure the container is either under 3.4 ounces or pack it in your checked luggage.  Advertisement  Powdered Skin Care  Powdered forms of skin care are another relatively new addition to the market. Skin care fanatics can find everything from cleansers to serums to even sunscreens in powdered form.  If you like your skin care like you like your donuts (powdered), you’re in luck! The TSA allows travelers to bring up to 12 ounces of powder-like substances in their carry-on luggage. Anything larger might require extra screening.  Jenkins notes that powdered forms of skin care should remain in their pre-mixed, powdered form to comply with the 12-ounce limit for powder-like substances.  Advertisement  Sheet Masks  In case you need a little extra pampering in the boarding area while your flight has been delayed for the third time, according to Jenkins, individually packaged sheet masks are (fortunately) allowed in carry-on luggage.  Baby and makeup wipes also receive the OK from TSA for your carry-on luggage.  Don’t Make These Carry-On Skin Care Mistakes  Opened or unopened, ALL containers must be 3.4 ounces or less.  If you frequently travel through international airports, you may have seen a fellow traveler waltz through security with full-sized skin care products purchased from duty-free.  While these sealed and unopened liquids (skin care and otherwise) from duty-free are allowed through TSA checkpoints under special conditions, don’t assume you can bring your full-sized products from home through the security checkpoint simply because they are unopened.  Advertisement  “The biggest misconception I see with passengers coming through the checkpoint is that an item can be any size as long as it’s not opened, and that’s not true,” Jenkins said. “So even if you have a 12-ounce bottle of lotion that’s still closed and has the manufacturer seal on it, it still will not be able to come through your carry-on bag.”  The TSA goes by container size, not the amount in the container.  Jenkins says another mistake she sees is passengers using a container that is larger than 3.4 ounces to store their skin care products, even when the contents are less than 3.4 ounces. If you pack your skin care in a larger container, you might run the risk of the item not making it past the TSA security checkpoint.  “We go by container size,” Jenkins said.  Even if you only have one ounce of the viral (and very pricey) SK-II essence left in the 11-ounce packaging you snagged from Costco, play it safe and either pack it in your checked luggage or leave it at home for you to enjoy when you return after the holidays.  Advertisement  Give yourself plenty of extra time at the airport.  In the recent past, it was the norm to arrive at the airport two hours before your flight’s departure. But nowadays, you may need to arrive even earlier— particularly during the busy holiday travel season.  Carter Langston, the press secretary for the TSA, cautions that travelers may need to plan to get to the airport even earlier, particularly if they need to return rental vehicles or check baggage during airport “rush hours.”  “Rush hours tend to be early in the morning between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. and in the afternoon between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.,” Langston said.  Advertisement  While arriving early to the airport will allow you to rest a little easier during your holiday travels, Jenkins says budging this extra time will also make the security checkpoint process easier for yourself and TSA officers.  “Travelers should also remember that anytime that they’re coming through the checkpoint, anything that will be in your accessible property could be subjected to additional screening,” Jenkins said.  Just in case a TSA officer needs to make an additional screening at the security checkpoint, Jenkins recommends making everything easier for both yourself and the officer by removing your 1-quart bag of products from your carry-on luggage before sending it through the X-ray machine.  Advertisement  “If [the skin care product] does have to go through additional screening, by it being outside of the bag, it’s easier for the officer to locate it,” Jenkins said.

If you’re an avid traveler, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your passport fill up with stamps, turning that once-blank travel document into a nostalgic little memory book.  But as delightful as it is to have a paper trail of evidence of your past adventures, your large stamp collection could lead to issues on future trips if you don’t pay close attention. That’s all due to a passport validity rule that many people overlook.  Advertisement  “One rule many travelers miss is needing an adequate number of blank pages in their passport for visas, and entry and exit stamps,” David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com, told HuffPost. “This is often forgotten, especially by those with passports close to expiring or having only a few blank pages.”  The U.S. State Department did not set the blank pages rule, which stems from other countries’ requirements for international visitors.  “Some countries require passports to have at least two to four blank visa or stamp pages, and thus, some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met,” said Caroline Tanner, a trends writer at The Points Guy.  Advertisement  Just as travelers often need to have at least three to six months of passport validity beyond the dates of an international trip, they may also need to have a certain number of empty pages depending on the requirements at their destination.  “The basis for this rule is maintaining proper security measures and part of the entry and exit requirements,” Alwadish said. “Not meeting this requirement can cause problems at borders. If the traveler does not have the required blank pages in the passport, the passport will technically be invalid and the person may not be allowed to board the plane.”  He emphasized that airlines can bar passengers who do not meet the requirement from boarding their flights to avoid complications at the international destination.  Advertisement  “If for whatever reason it is overlooked in the U.S., the traveler may take a big risk once they arrive at their destination country, as every border patrol officer has the right to determine the outcome,” Alwadish explained. “They may have travelers detained, pay a fine or let them pass.”  Taking that kind of risk in a foreign country is not advisable, he added. And there’s a long list of countries that have this rule in place. Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Germany, India, Belgium, South Africa, the Netherlands, Cuba, Iceland, Zimbabwe and Indonesia are among the destinations that require two blank pages. Countries that require one page include France, Japan, Mexico, Greece, Thailand, Australia, Morocco, Argentina and Vietnam, among others. But you’ll need at least three blank pages if you want to visit Namibia, Botswana, Madagascar and Zambia.  “While some pages may be full of stamps, others might have one ― and just one stamp means that that page is not empty,” Alwadish cautioned.  Advertisement  Immigration authorities in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have also emphasized that the “endorsement” pages found at the back of many passports are different from visa pages and thus do not count as blank pages for the purposes of entry and exit stamps. (Newer passports have the endorsement section closer to the front.)  Meanwhile, Armenia and Micronesia have no stated blank passport page requirements.  “Countries like Sweden and the Philippines don’t require a blank page on your passport, but rather sufficient space for entry and exit stamps,” Alwadish noted.  He recommended looking at the State Department’s website for a breakdown of the specific entry prerequisites for each country.  Advertisement  Jake Wyman via Getty Images Many avid travelers delight in their extensive collections of passport stamps, but it's important to check the blank page requirements before visiting an international destination.  Keep in mind that blank page rules don’t just apply to U.S. visitors, either.  “This is true for all incoming travelers to the country, regardless of nationality, based on requirements set by individual countries for incoming visitors,” Tanner said.  Over time, frequent travelers may not need to worry as much about having enough empty passport pages.  Advertisement  “The issue of blank passport pages will likely become less of a significant problem for travelers as more countries are phasing out manual stamping of physical passport books,” Alwadish said. “The European Union is spearheading this shift with the introduction of the Entry/Exit System, intended to expedite the border control process and improve data accuracy.”  He explained that this new system uses biometric technology to scan travelers’ fingerprints and faces at border checkpoints.  “This data will then be stored and used to verify their arrival and exits, cross referenced with their passport information, removing the necessity for physical passport stamps,” he said.  Advertisement  But for now, immigration officers still need to ensure there are enough pages for stamps and visas. So travelers must remain vigilant.  “It is always best to make sure your passport is valid and has at least two blank pages,” Alwadish noted. “If a traveler does not have enough blank pages available, they cannot add more to their physical book.”  As of 2016, the U.S. government does not allow travelers to add extra pages to their existing passports. If they need more pages, they must renew their passports.  Advertisement  People who often travel internationally might want to consider choosing the option for a bigger passport with more visa pages. It’s no extra cost, and all you have to do is check the box that says “large book” when you fill out the form.  If you have an impending trip abroad, there are ways to get a new passport in a rush on your own or by paying a third party for expedited service. And of course, the best way to avoid adding extra stress and hassle is to keep track of your passport and ensure it’s compliant throughout the year.",US,The 1 Big Mistake You Should Avoid With Your Passport,,,,0.049,0.874,0.077,0.9863
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/queef-vagina-fart-flatulence-sex-ano_l_675ca50fe4b08821cba78ed8,Huffington Post,neutral,Politics,,"Cavan Images via Getty Images Flatulence from your vagina during sex or physical activities like yoga is common and nothing to be ashamed of.  Queefing, as anyone with a vagina will tell you, can happen at some inopportune times: while you’re having sex, in the middle of a yoga class or during a visit to the gynecologist.  You may have heard some people refer to queefs as “vaginal farts” (charming). But while queefs do produce a toot-like sound, we can assure you that queefing is not the same as passing gas.  Advertisement  We talked to gynecologists and sex therapists to learn more about what causes queefs, some of the misconceptions about them and why they shouldn’t be as mortifying as we make them out to be.  What makes you queef, anyway?  Queefing is an involuntary bodily function that occurs when air is pushed into the vagina, gets temporarily trapped in the folds of the vaginal canal (called rugae) and is then released.  Advertisement  “Queefing happens when a penis, fingers or sex toy go in and out of the vagina bringing additional air along with it,” Sherry A. Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, California and the author of “She-ology: The Definitive Guide to Women’s Intimate Health,” told HuffPost. “Sex can involve a lot of thrusting of the penis in and out of the vagina, typically pushing extra air into a dead-end space.”  Certain sex positions, like doggy style where your pelvis is titled upwards, or abruptly switching from one position to another, may increase the likelihood of queefing. Even non-sexual activities, like putting in a tampon or menstrual cup, practicing yoga (like when you move out of an inversion pose) or your gyno inserting a speculum can lead to queefing.  “From my experience as an OB-GYN, almost every woman has experienced at least one episode of queefing some time during her life, sometimes even during a pelvic exam,” said Diana Hoppe, an OB-GYN in Encinitas, California.  While the gas that comes out of your rectum may have a foul odor (a result of bacterial activity in the gut), queefs are odorless, Hoppe added.  Advertisement  Can you prevent a queef?  And as OB-GYN Sheila Loanzon told Cosmopolitan, “If you try to contract the vaginal canal to prevent air from coming in, it can cause sex to be more painful.”  Advertisement  “Also, when doing any abdominal exercises or weight-bearing exercise, it is important to squeeze the pelvic floor while holding the core abdominal muscles tight,” Hoppe said. “Many women squeeze abdominal muscles but do not activate the pelvic floor at the same time, thus allowing the pelvic floor to sag, increasing the likelihood of air entering into vaginal canal.”  During sex, keeping the penis, fingers or sex toy inside you while you change positions could lessen your chances of queefing because it “gives air less of an opportunity to get into the vagina,” Jamil Abdur-Rahman, an OB-GYN and the chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vista Health System in Waukegan, Illinois, told Self.  Advertisement  And in theory, you could just avoid certain sex or yoga positions altogether. But what’s the fun in that?  When queefing does happen, don’t sweat it.  So why does this very normal bodily function feel so embarrassing in the moment, be it during doggy-style or downward dog? It really just comes down to that pesky noise, Hoppe said.  “The stigma is due to lack of understanding the difference between release of air from the vagina and flatulence,” she said. “The sound effects may be the same though, so culturally there may be a stigma or embarrassment due to this occurring ‘down there.’”  Advertisement  Sex therapist Vanessa Marin underscored the fact that queefing is normal, common and “not anything to be ashamed of.” Embracing the awkwardness of the moment can even make sex more enjoyable for both partners.  “Our bodies make funny noises sometimes, and that’s OK!” she said. “Plus, there are plenty of other goofy things about sex, like getting sweaty, slipping out, getting into awkward positions and so on. The more we can laugh about these kinds of things, the more fun we’ll have during sex.”  When a queef slips out mid-coitus, you have two choices: ignore that deflating balloon sound completely or quickly acknowledge it and move on. Marin prefers the latter route.  Advertisement  “It’s a personal preference, but I think it’s better to just quickly acknowledge it and laugh it off,” she said. “That way you don’t have to sit there thinking about it, anxiously wondering whether or not your partner heard it.”  Is queefing ever cause for concern?  Generally, queefing is nothing to be worried about. While rare, if queefing is accompanied by pain or a bad smell, you should make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any more serious issues.  “If queefing is associated with a foul odor, it may be an indication of a vaginal infection or possible fistula, an [abnormal] connection between rectum and vagina due to previous radiation treatment or surgery that causes stool or feces to come out of the vagina,” Hoppe said.  Advertisement  But for the most part, queefing is a normal, if slightly awkward, fact of life. So let’s not get so hung up on it, OK?",US,"Here’s Why You Queef During Sex.

Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.

MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.  Advertisement  “Whether or not it’s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I’m saying is it’s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,” he added.  ___",US,"Drone Mystery Grows As Flying Object Sightings Continue In New Jersey, Other States",,,,0.058,0.868,0.074,0.9502

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dementia-risk-study-exercise-chores-ano_l_6759ee43e4b02802b83c2d03,Huffington Post,neutral,Politics,,"MoMo Productions via Getty Images The simple task of doing chores is now linked with a reduction in the risk of developing dementia.  Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

Left: Amazon MGM Studios; Right: Roadside Attractions  Unless folks are doing something like recording whole scenes of a movie on their cellphones, you generally don’t notice who else is in the audience with you at a movie theater. The lights fade to black, the screen brightens and everything — and everyone — around you virtually disappears. But sometimes taking stock of how others react to a film can tell you a lot about who becomes the arbiters of merit and why.  That’s especially true when you’re watching a Black movie.  An example that comes to mind is “12 Years a Slave,” which tells the harrowing true story of a free Black man who was abducted and sold into slavery in 1841. At a 2013 press screening for the film in Manhattan, an inclusive audience sat transfixed in front of the screen during multiple scenes of sexual and physical violence.  Advertisement  Perusing the theater during those moments revealed something interesting. Some Black viewers were stone-faced, while others seemed exhausted by the second or third brutality scene. Many of the white folks, though, were inconsolable — sobbing and blowing their noses. Perhaps that was on account of white guilt, a performative impulse, or because the film really is that stirring.  In any case, “12 Years a Slave,” a Steve McQueen-directed movie that unflinchingly portrays the horrors of white supremacy, was heralded by a predominantly white and so-called liberal Hollywood elite. And it went on to earn nine Oscar nominations.  There was another staggering Black drama released that same year that was also a nonfiction story dealing with systemic racism, though in a more modern context: “Fruitvale Station.” It earned exactly zero nominations from that same voting branch.  Advertisement  While the Ryan Coogler-directed film can hardly be accused of not engaging with the issue of whiteness through the lens of police brutality, there is a crucial difference between it and the aforementioned offering. It does not hinge on the racially motivated atrocity against its lead character or its perpetrator. Rather, it centers the Black human life that was cut short. It examines who the person was outside of the system of whiteness.  Ethan Herisse (left) and Brandon Wilson in ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  In essence, it’s not a film that necessarily brings white audiences into its story. It actually seems indifferent to whatever reaction they might have. A Hollywood voting establishment that, in spite of all its lip service, has always had an issue appreciating art that does not revolve around their lives or even their ills could see that as a detriment.  Advertisement  They often look for art they can laud that can at least give the appearance that they’re progressive despite showing all signs of the opposite. It’s a self-gratifying tactic that doesn’t serve the art at all, no matter how good it is.  It’s been over a decade since “12 Years a Slave” and “Fruitvale Station” were released, and white people’s proximity to a Black narrative still weighs heavily on their acclaim for it. This year’s “Nickel Boys” and “Exhibiting Forgiveness” are two other Black films that have had parallel journeys to the big screen and awards season. But their trajectories could not be more different — and for the same reason as their predecessors.  Similar to “12 Years a Slave,” “Nickel Boys,” an adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, is an unrelenting drama following the lives of two young Black men trying to survive an abusive and racist reform school in the 1960s. The performances are good. The movie’s technical merit, including its marvelous cinematography, has already helped it earn the attention of several awards bodies.  Advertisement  Despite it not even being released in limited theaters until Friday, there’s hardly a day that goes by in the last few months — since its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival this summer — that there isn’t press or hype about it. That includes numerous press screenings and initiatives.  But with the effects of systemic oppression being an impeding factor of the story, leaving little space to explore the characters’ humanity, it’s hard not to again wonder whether its appeal to arbitrated audiences is also that it is more for them to appreciate than others who might identify with their experiences.  André Holland (left) and Andra Day in ""Exhibiting Forgiveness."" Courtesy of Roadside Attractions  Advertisement  Director RaMell Ross said he didn’t intend for that to be the case, though. When the filmmaker was asked in an interview with Vanity Fair what his expectations are of audiences that are “older, very white and wealthier,” he replied that “Nickel Boys” “emerges from our centrality, and it ostensibly is for us, but I’m happy to give it to others.”  “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” on the other hand, doesn’t provoke that same question. It almost entirely wrestles with the complexities of its Black characters, and in ways Black audiences especially recognize. Systemic prejudices are understood as the reality in which they live, only because they are Black and it’s set in the present day, not because the plot informs that. There’s nary a moment when the film even gestures toward that to tell its story.  That helps create an intensely insulated film that centers a Black family whose drama is also deeply felt and astoundingly performed. The conflicts, joy and contradictions that propel the plot are of their own making — and not the result of a racially motivated antagonist. White people, come to think of it, are merely ornamental in the story.  Advertisement  It is unequivocally a film by and for Black people to grapple with among ourselves — one that has similarly affected Black audiences in the way “12 Years a Slave” moved white viewers. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” allows white audiences to enter its narrative incidentally only, while films like “Nickel Boys” and “12 Years a Slave” often engage directly with their white audiences through their own historical (and present-day) examination.  It’s a distinction that often results in the latter films being considered worthy of Hollywood’s highest honors.  Taking a look at the theatrical and post-theatrical odysseys of “Exhibiting Forgiveness” and “Nickel Boys” might help bring this into further focus. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is an original story that was amazingly green-lit in our sequel- and adaptation-obsessed culture and based on the personal experiences of writer-director Titus Kaphar, a first-time feature filmmaker.  Advertisement  “Nickel Boys” came with all the fanfare of a known author, an acclaimed literary honor under its belt and at least the assumption that its Jim Crow-era setting means that whiteness could obviously play a significant role in the story. Even Ross’ avant-garde filmmaking that shifts the camera and perspective between the two lead characters couldn’t deter an audience that was already locked in.  Herisse stars as Elwood in a moment from ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  Ross also told Vanity Fair that the process between the film being green-lit and going into production through Orion Pictures and Amazon MGM Studios was fairly smooth, to his own surprise. And since its Telluride premiere just a few months ago, “Nickel Boys” has experienced a constant whirlwind of praise from various awards bodies and audiences.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, Kaphar told me during an interview that “it was a fight” to get “Exhibiting Forgiveness” released in theaters. Like many filmmakers, especially Black filmmakers whose work is too often considered niche, Kaphar was approached about bringing the film to a streaming service.  Despite earning rave reviews following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it went months without being acquired, and then months later — not until October — it was released by Roadside Attractions. By then, many people had forgotten about it or just hadn’t heard much about it at all.  Save from a video-on-demand release and awards screeners available to voting press, the film hasn’t been able to achieve any major award nominations and hasn’t popped up on most “best of 2024” lists. (It made HuffPost’s roundup.) Unlike “Fruitvale Station,” it also failed to earn an Independent Spirit Award nomination or other award precursor nominations.  Advertisement  None of this discussion is to elevate any one Black film above another, suggest that a certain kind of Black film is better than the next, or even pit two films against each other. Both can and should be in the conversation.

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads. Try and win an argument with any woman in Canada,” he said. “We’re pretty tough and resilient people.”",US,'He's A Juvenile': Canadian Lawmaker Slams Trump's 'Idiotic Behavior' After Tariff Threats,,,,0.123,0.763,0.114,-0.7272

(South Korean Presidential Office/Yonhap via AP) via AP  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s parliament on Saturday impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his stunning and short-lived martial law decree, a move that ended days of political paralysis but set up an intense debate over Yoon’s fate, as jubilant crowds roared to celebrate another defiant moment in the country’s resilient democracy.  The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85. Yoon’s presidential powers and duties were subsequently suspended and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s No. 2 official, took over presidential powers later Saturday.  Advertisement  The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he’s thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon’s impeachment after ruling party lawmakers boycotted it last Saturday. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon’s impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon’s impeachment was an outcome driven by “the people’s ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.”  Advertisement  Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, “We have preserved the constitutional order!”  In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached. Both rallies have largely been peaceful.

(AP Photo/Ahnn Young-joon) Ahn Young-joon via AP  The new leader bolsters the country’s security posture  Yoon issued a statement saying he would “never give up” and calling for officials to maintain stability in government functions during what he described as a “temporary” pause of his presidency.  “I will carry with me all the criticisms, encouragement and support directed toward me, and I will continue to do my utmost for the country until the very last moment,” Yoon said.  Advertisement  Han, who became the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han’s office.  South Korea’s executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade and finance and was the ambassador to the U.S. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.  Advertisement  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred.  Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law.  The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon “committed rebellion that hurts peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.” It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.  Advertisement  Yoon remains defiant  In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon had rejected the rebellion charges, calling his order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it “a monster” and “anti-state forces” that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.  Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a “mad declaration of war” against his own people.  Observers say Yoon’s speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon’s approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.  Advertisement  Some of Yoon’s claims don’t align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.  Most notably, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that after martial law was announced, Yoon called him and asked for his troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he didn’t carry out Yoon’s orders.  Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.  Advertisement  In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers. Roh jumped to his death in 2009, after he had left office, amid a corruption scandal involving his family.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea.  He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations.",US,South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol Impeached After Martial Law Order,,,,0.135,0.765,0.099,-0.9932

If the news these days overwhelms you, you’re hardly alone: America is as politically polarized as ever. Almost every day, there’s a new controversial Cabinet pick from President-elect Donald Trump. There are drawn-out wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and here in the U.S., some say we’re on the edge of a looming class war.  In short, we are living in bizarre, capital-letter Unprecedented Times. If you’re able to block it all out and not take on the stress, you’re lucky.  Advertisement  A week after Trump won the election, independent journalist Marisa Kabas wrote on Bluesky about how frenzied the news cycle makes her feel.  “There has to be a better way than sounding an alarm every single time a deranged Trump-related story drops,” she said. “It’s unhealthy and unsustainable. We need to find a way to stay informed without spiking cortisol and without losing sight of the bigger picture. I’m just...not sure how.”  Advertisement  A month later, Kabas says she’s still considering this question.  “When there’s a deluge of really intense news, I know my instinct is often ‘make it stop.’ But since I know the news is never going to stop, I’ve been trying in those moments to think instead of momentarily putting it aside,” said Kabas, who publishes The Handbasket, a newsletter about politics, media and power.  Advertisement  Kabas think people need to remind themselves that just because news is available to them at all times doesn’t mean they’re required to consume it. You can gauge your personal limit and clock out when you need to.  “This isn’t to say ignorance is bliss; at this really scary moment in history, some tolerance for distress is required to avoid being complicit in allowing this country to passively slide all the way into fascism,” she told HuffPost. “But if you’re overwhelmed, choose a few outlets you trust and read them as often as you find tolerable.”  What other steps can you take to manage the emotional impact stressful news has on you?

(In other words, go outside and maybe take a walk.)  “When I feel overwhelmed by the news, one of the most grounding things I do is take a step back from consuming media and reconnect with nature and my community. It’s so easy to get caught in a doomscroll spiral, but stepping outside and being present with people who lift you up can make a world of difference. For me, that often looks like hitting a local trail with my queer chosen family. We hike, talk and hold space for each other as we navigate these challenging times. It’s a reminder that even in uncertainty, we have the power to create moments of connection and care.

Advertisement  Choose a few issues you’re interested in and keep your news intake limited to those.  “One approach is to choose an issue or two that matter most to you and stick to news on those topics to avoid the sense that all the news is bad. I’ve found that can be more mentally manageable and also helps you become more learned in specific areas. Win/win.” ― Kabas  Focus on things that bring you joy, give you perspective and that are in your control.  “I step away from the news and focus in on the things in life that bring me joy (my infant son, my wife, our friends and family, music, running), give me perspective (the woods, the ocean, our long history as a resilient and adaptive trans community), and that I can control (how I show up for myself, my family, and my community, and the contributions I make every day in ways big and small to the collective and enduring effort to create a more peaceful and inclusive world).

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/should-you-open-bottle-of-wine-host-gift_l_6744ac9be4b0b7647d8a1385,Huffington Post,neutral,Politics,,"Lorenzo Conti For HuffPost  When visiting a friend’s house for dinner or a party, it’s a common tradition to bring a gift for the host. This might be a bouquet of flowers, a scented candle or even a bottle of wine. But sometimes, a gifted item of food or drink can cause miscommunication between hosts and guests.  For instance, if a host thanks their guest for bringing a bottle of wine, but it never appears on the communal bar or dinner table, does that mean the host isn’t happy with the gift?  Advertisement  What are the rules and guidelines around edible and drinkable gifts, and how can hosts clearly communicate their expectations? To answer these questions, we turned to a group of modern etiquette experts and event professionals.  Serving or not serving gifted items is totally up to the host.  The first thing to remember about bringing a gift to a party is that, once given, the gift becomes the sole property of the host, and what happens to it is up to them.  Advertisement  “Host gifts, whether it is a bottle of wine, a handmade food item or a box of candy, are not expected to be opened and offered at the gathering unless the guest and host have discussed it and agreed to do so,” confirmed Renate Devin, the owner of the Boston School of Etiquette.  Jamila Musayeva, a certified etiquette coach and the author of “The Art of Entertaining at Home,” agreed, adding that “when you bring a bottle of wine, homemade cookies or any edible item as a gift, it’s thoughtful to remember that this is a gesture of appreciation, not an expectation for it to be served immediately. Hosts usually have planned their menu and wine selection, so a well-chosen gift is best viewed as something for them to enjoy later, unless they specifically ask you to contribute to the party offerings. It is up to the host to serve or open what the guest has brought because the host is in charge of planning the menu and deciding how and what to serve — particularly pairing of beverages with food.”  So if your friend doesn’t open the bottle of pinot noir that you brought to dinner, don’t take it personally. They’re likely planning to save it for another time!  The host should communicate whether guests are expected to contribute a dish or drink to the party.  Sit-down dinner events and potluck dinners abide by specific rules, but many house parties fall into a nebulous middle ground. Food will be served and the host is planning to provide the mains, but if a guest wants to contribute a side dish or a dessert (or a bottle of vino), the addition is often encouraged.  Advertisement  As a host, providing clear communication can chase away any doubts or misunderstandings about what a guest should bring, or whether they should bring something at all.  “If a host has thoughts or opinions on what guests should bring, they should communicate the expectation in advance,” suggested Melissa Ben-Ishay, the founder and CEO of the company Baked by Melissa. “Oftentimes, when my own guests ask what they can bring, I give them a category. Bring dessert, or bring an adult beverage — this helps the host weave these things into the serving plan.”  You can even be more specific with your guests about which items would be helpful for the meal, said Christine Schaub, the host of “Come on Over,” a web series that is available on YouTube and focuses on home entertaining. Schaub said that such a conversation might go like this: “A pinot grigio would pair beautifully with the salad course. Would you like to bring a bottle?” Then, if the guest asks “for a suggested vintner, be ready with affordable suggestions,” she added.  Advertisement  And if a guest shows up at your door with a gift but you’re not sure whether it’s intended to be shared at the party, Schaub said that you can pick up on some clues from the presentation. “If a beverage arrives in a gift bag, it is truly a gift — not a shareable,” she advised, noting that the same goes for food items.“It’s entirely up to the host whether to serve or save it for another time. If a beverage arrives hot or chilled (in an insulated tote), that’s your tip that [it was intended to] ... be served.”  It might seem tacky to include details about gifts in an invitation (since you as the host may not want guests to think that you expect a present), but Musayeva said there’s a way to express your preferred policy without seeming like a gift-grubber.  “If you’re hosting and prefer not to incorporate gifts into the event’s refreshments, feel free to mention it in a warm and subtle way ahead of time,” Musayeva suggested. “A quick message like ‘Looking forward to seeing everyone! Your presence is the best gift, but if you do bring something special, I’d love to enjoy it later on my own’ makes it clear without any pressure.”  Advertisement  Guests can also take the initiative to ask whether they should bring something.  Hosts have a lot of elements to juggle when preparing for a dinner or a party, so invitation details can sometimes fall by the wayside. If you receive an invite but still aren’t sure whether to bring a dish or a drink, don’t hesitate to shoot the host a quick text message or email.  “It is recommended to ask the host beforehand if one can contribute in any way to the party and what would be most suitable,” Musayeva pointed out. “Perhaps extra portions of cookies or fruits would be appreciated, or beverages. If that is the case, then it is acceptable to assume the host will serve what you brought.”  If you want to give an edible gift while avoiding ambiguity, stay clear of baked goods and wine.  Since gifts like wine and cookie platters could go either way in a “to serve immediately or not?” debate, you might consider a different option to prevent the host from wondering if your offering is meant to be shared.  Advertisement  Shannon Smith, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based private chef and the author of “The Hidden Table,” said possible food and drink gifts may include “gourmet olive oil or balsamic vinegar, artisan chocolates, or infused sea salts or seasonings.” On a similar note, Ben-Ishay said that she likes to “make homemade vanilla extract a year in advance and use that as a gift to bring [to parties]. It always feels extra special when it’s homemade.”  Musayeva noted that “when choosing a gift for a host, keeping their dietary preferences or alcohol choices in mind shows true thoughtfulness. Always bear in mind the religious/cultural background of the host, as alcoholic beverages and foods containing pork or cow meat might not be acceptable.”  A ‘no takebacks’ or ‘no givebacks’ policy always applies to party gifts.  Say a guest brings a bottle of wine to your dinner party, but you already have beverages mapped out for the night. If you’re tempted to hand the bottle back to your guest as they’re leaving, stop right there.  Advertisement  “It would be rude of the host to even attempt to give it back,” said August Abbott, an etiquette expert with the website JustAnswer. “This is a very, very common mistake.” Keep that bottle for later enjoyment (or regifting), but sending it back with the guest who presented it could be viewed as insulting.",US,Is It Rude If Your Dinner Party Host Didn't Open The Bottle Of Wine You Brought?,,,,0.022,0.793,0.186,0.9997

While it’s true that traveling with little ones will be different than what you’re used to, it’s still possible to indulge your wanderlust and explore new places as a family.  As you may have gathered from your paltry parental leave, the U.S. is not always the most welcoming country for families with children. Many other nations show more consideration for kids and parents in both their public policies and their cultural practices. Not all of these locales feature bathroom changing tables or stroller-friendly streets, but there is often a shared expectation that kids will be integrated into daily life, whether they’re riding public transit, dining out or visiting a national monument.  During one of our early forays abroad as parents, my wife and I took our 1-year-old to the Dominican Republic. We looked pretty ridiculous maneuvering our stroller through the cobblestone streets of old Santo Domingo, but everyone we interacted with was helpful and kind. A waiter in a traditional restaurant even picked up our baby and cheerfully walked around with him for a bit so that we could use both hands to enjoy our food. All our fellow diners got to watch our son return their smiles and bestow on him the standard “Dios le bendiga” (“God bless him”) that Dominicans offer every child who crosses their path.  Advertisement  Marie Holmes The author's son awaits lunch at a comedor in the Dominican Republic.  If you’re itching to roam beyond the U.S. with your kids, here are some recommendations from families with lots of travel experience. Of course, not every part of any country will be suited for kids, but these families were able to find child-friendly spots for making memories.  “The most important thing to remember there is that countries are not monoliths, and some parts of a city may be perfectly safe while others are not,” digital nomad and mom Courtney Orgias told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The Dominican Republic  In addition to a child-friendly culture, the all-inclusive resorts in beachy places like Puerto Plata can simplify life for families traveling with young ones.  “You don’t have to worry about lugging a carseat to multiple places or renting a car. They also typically have toddler pools, kids areas, activities and sometimes childcare. The buffets offer a variety of foods so there’s a good chance you’ll find something the baby/toddler will enjoy. The rooms also typically come with refrigerators for storing the baby’s food and milk,” Stephanie Claytor, founder of the brand Blacktrekking, told HuffPost.  Jamaica  Claytor mentions that similar all-inclusive accommodations, alongside white sand beaches and turquoise Caribbean water, are available in Jamaica.  Advertisement  “We took our son to Negril for his second birthday. Our favorite memory is of him dancing on the beach to reggae music during the all-white party on his birthday. We had no idea he could bust a move. He loved the party and reggae music. We of course were in the back away from the crowded dance floor but were still able to enjoy the DJ,” said Claytor.  She recommends looking for places that offer refrigerators (for breastfeeding parents who need to pump milk), ample shade and outdoor dining — “so that I’m not embarrassed when my son breaks out in loud singing or accidentally throws some food.”  With young children, almost any place can be kid-friendly. “Toddlers and babies are amused by the simplest things such as wood chips and stairways,” Claytor said. So if there’s a destination you’re keen to visit with your little one, you can probably find a way to make it work — just be ready to spend an afternoon collecting rocks instead of devouring your novel in the sun.  Advertisement  “Try to get out of your head any images of long afternoons lounging by the pool sipping cocktails,” said British travel blogger Jenny Lynn. “As a parent traveling with kids you still have to be ‘on,’” she continued. “But traveling provides you with a constantly changing backdrop to take on those daily parent chores, and with new adventures to experience together, daily life becomes all the more rewarding.”  Stephanie Claytor Claytor with her husband and child in Jamaica.  Portugal  “Lisbon can seem intimidating to explore with small kids because of all the hills — nobody wants to carry a toddler or push a stroller up a 30% incline — but we were able to take the bus to most places and found it to be efficient and clean; there were stops everywhere,” said Orgias.  Advertisement  Ample parks and green spaces allowed the kids to get their wiggles out and break up a day of sightseeing, she added.  Mexico  Public transportation also makes Mexico City (Mexico D.F.) more navigable for families, according to Orgias. It “has a great train system we were able to utilize and it’s very walkable, with lots of wonderful neighborhoods that are easy to explore on foot,” she said.  Advertisement  “Worrying about traveling with car seats and hopping in and out of ride shares and taxis is scary for a lot of parents,” she explained, but good public transportation options can allay these concerns.  Costa Rica  If your kids eat rice and beans, they’ll have always something to nosh on with gallo pinto at every meal. Maria De la O of Roam Family Travel told HuffPost that year-round access to fresh fruit also made it easy to keep kids satisfied.  There’s plenty to see, between the jungle and the beach. De la O and her family booked a tour via National Geographic Expeditions with local guides and saw about 20 different animals during their stay.

If you’re a living, breathing human on this planet, chances are that someone, at some point, has urged you to eat your fruits and vegetables. There are good reasons for that: Eating a diet low in fruit and veggies, and high in saturated fats, puts you at risk of developing heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It only makes sense, then, that produce-forward meal plans protect your cardiovascular health. These diets are known to help control risk factors for heart disease like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. (However, medication is necessary sometimes, too.)  Advertisement  The Mediterranean diet is a common heart-healthy approach, but there’s another option that may also be key to lowering your cholesterol and your risk of coronary artery disease: the portfolio diet.  Below, experts share the rundown on this plant-forward meal plan and why it’s worth trying.  What is the portfolio diet?  “The portfolio diet was proposed about 20 years ago, and it has a lot in common with other heart-healthy diets that that you heard of, such as a Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet and a whole food, plant-based diet,” said Dr. Sarah Hull, an associate professor of medicine in cardiology at Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut.  Advertisement  “The name comes from the fact that this diet includes a portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods, so foods that reduce mostly the bad cholesterol in the diet,” noted Kristina Petersen, an associate professor in the department of nutritional sciences at Pennsylvania State University.  The portfolio diet is made up of four different food profiles, Melissa Prest, a clinical nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told HuffPost via email. It encourages the consumption of plant-based protein, plant sterols (a natural compound that helps lower cholesterol levels), soluble fiber and monounsaturated fat.  This means “eating a lot of foods like beans, lentils, soy, nuts and seeds, fruits, vegetables and whole grains as a way to obtain those foods, which basically, again, is very similar to whole food plant-based diet,” Hull said.  Some other heart-healthy diets, like the Mediterranean diet and the DASH eating plan, also include animal products like fish and poultry, and dairy products like yogurt and cheese. But the portfolio diet is vegan — which means if you intend to follow the diet exactly, you’ll need to remove any animal products from your rotation.  Advertisement  The portfolio diet specifically focuses on cholesterol, so it’s a good option if you struggle with that.  According to Petersen, the portfolio diet is not as well-studied as the Mediterranean diet, but the data that is available shows it can significantly benefit your cardiovascular health.  “There have been several studies done where they’ve shown pretty substantial lowering of LDL cholesterol ― so the bad cholesterol that increases risk of heart disease ― with this diet,” Petersen said. “In the original study, the lowering was about 29% in four weeks.”  Advertisement  “And then [researchers] did a subsequent study where they actually compared following this diet with lovastatin, which is a pharmaceutical agent to lower cholesterol, and they actually saw a pretty comparable lowering of LDL,” Petersen said. “So we have quite a bit of evidence that it lowers LDL cholesterol, and this is really what the diet is best known for.”  There are still health rewards even if you just add parts of the portfolio diet to your lifestyle. “Each of the four portfolios can reduce cholesterol levels by 5-10%,” Prest said.  Lowering bad cholesterol is “an important part of preventing and treating cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and stroke,” Hull said.  Advertisement  Research also shows that people who follow the portfolio diet are 14% less likely to develop coronary heart disease and have a stroke, according to the American Heart Association.  There are also other health benefits to the portfolio diet: It’s anti-inflammatory and can help people reach their daily fiber goal (most Americans are fiber deficient), Hull said. Women need between 21 and 25 grams of fiber each day, and men need between 30 and 38 grams daily.  martin-dm via Getty Images Nuts and seeds are a key part of this heart-healthy diet.  Advertisement  Here’s how you can take steps to add the portfolio diet to your lifestyle:  “Thinking about making incremental changes rather than making huge, sweeping changes is one of the most important principles to keep in mind,” Hull said. “So, the first thing is to think about [is], ‘What’s my biggest barrier to incorporating healthy changes?’”  If money is an issue, consider buying frozen fruits and veggies instead of fresh — they’ll last longer and are usually cheaper than the fresh alternative, Hull suggested. Bulk dried legumes, such as beans and lentils, are also more economical, she noted.  If your issue is time, consider meal prepping on the weekends, and look up plant-based, make-ahead recipes. Or if you just don’t know how to prep plant-based meals, consider talking to your doctor or a dietitian.  Advertisement  You can start small by focusing on one meal a day. For example, you could begin by eating oatmeal topped with nuts or seeds for breakfast, Petersen said. Or you could try following the portfolio diet at lunch by making grain bowls with quinoa or brown rice topped with chickpeas, veggies and tofu.  Even just snacking on unsalted nuts, apples and peanut butter, or carrots and hummus is part of this diet, Hull noted.  The portfolio diet still has benefits even if you don’t completely follow it.  Let’s be real: Going from a meat-based diet to a totally vegan meal plan is a big ask. Luckily, you don’t have to go fully vegan to see cardiovascular benefits.  Advertisement  “I think you can still incorporate the key features of the portfolio diet [such as whole grains, nuts, vegetables, beans and fruit] without excluding animal products if you want to include those,” Petersen said. “We have a lot of evidence for viscous fiber, plant sterols, soy and nuts reducing cholesterol levels, so if you just ate more of those foods, you would see cholesterol lowering.”  It’s true that you’ll get the greatest health benefits out of this diet if you follow it to the letter. But even just following it when you can is also good for you.  “The more adherent you can be to a diet like the portfolio diet ― or any predominantly whole food, plant-based diet ― the more benefit you can expect to get in terms of lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as lowering risk of cancer and certain metabolic diseases as well,” Hull said.",US,Want To Lower Your Heart Disease Risk?

The year’s end is approaching and, yet again, I am knee deep in planning a meal that can feed 12 people, finding the right candles that represent my personal brand — whatever that may be — and calculating how many bottles of wine to pick up from Costco without fighting anyone in line.  Similarly to the moments after I gave birth to my first daughter, every year after my annual Christmas party, I whisper to myself, “never again.” And just like that, you have another child, and another holiday party. I adore hosting, but at the end of December, I swear up and down that I’ll never host again, never drink again, and that next year is my time to get those abs I know are hidden somewhere.  Advertisement  I think it is safe to say my closest group of friends enjoys (nay, expects) this annual party. I refuse to disappoint people I love dearly, so I’m elated to host over and over again.  But my guests don’t get off that easy. I expect a few things from my nearest and dearest in regards to a dinner party. Nothing should elicit anyone to clutch their pearls, but if so, hold on tight.  Advertisement  Being fashionably late is applauded.  Promptness is, yes, very important in life. Time is precious, and if someone is wasting that preciousness, that is — to me — punishable by many, many eyerolls and heavy sighs. But in the case of my Christmas party, I’m applauding a 5-to-10-minute delay.  Advertisement  If the invitation states the party begins at 7 p.m., showing up on the dot can be stressful if I’m still basting a turkey or slicing vegetables for a salad (read: reheating chicken cacciatore I bought from a local catering company) so, take a beat between parking your car or getting out of your Uber. Tie your shoe in slow-motion, if need be. A slight delay means your host has a little wiggle room.  Etiquette expert Mariah Grumet, the founder and instructor of Old Soul Etiquette, says using a 10-minute delay is the acceptable thing to do. “For a social event such as a Christmas party, the proper etiquette is to aim to arrive on time or within 10-15 minutes of the invitation time. It would be considered poor etiquette to arrive at someone’s social event early, as you’d want to give your host every last second to put their finishing touches on their event. Beyond 15 minutes would simply be considered late, which is definitely rude to your host! There is a sweet spot, and for your 7 p.m. party, that is 7-7:15 p.m., not 6:59 p.m.”  If you offer to bring something, be specific.  Depending on the level of your party (potluck, family style, fully catered) you might have people ask, “Can I bring anything?” This is a lovely notion, but a conflicting one. While I’d love not to make dessert or put together a salad on top of everything else that needs to be done, I’m not necessarily going to dole out roles for my friends, either. Instead, I’d love someone to just claim a dish. “I make a mean charcuterie board, can I bring that?” would actually alleviate a lot of my stress and financial burden of hosting.  Advertisement  Transferring a piping-hot lasagna might not be in the cards, but a lot of dishes can easily be prepared ahead or, at the very least, out of the host’s way — even if that means cutting cucumbers in a laundry room.  Bring something you’d want to drink, in case the well runs dry.  In conjunction with offering to bring something, if you know other people are drinking alcoholic beverages, you can bring an option to be shared among the guests. Something bottled is the obvious choice: wine, beer or champagne.  Hosting can add up quickly and alcohol is a fairly big factor in that. Contributing to the communal pile is always appreciated. And, if it’s not touched or open, snag it back if you wish!  Advertisement  Olga Pankova via Getty Images Be ready for the hosts to crack open the bottle you gave them at the dinner party; but not everyone will.  While I believe this is absolutely appropriate in a smaller setting and with close friends, etiquette aficionado Mariah Grumet does not: “As a guest, it is absolutely appropriate to ask your host what you can bring when you respond to their invitation. If they ask you to bring something to drink to share, or bring something you enjoy drinking (alcohol or not), by all means, bring it! If no one drinks it, I would advise leaving it as a bonus for your host.  “However, if your host insists that you do not bring anything, you want to respect their wishes. There’s a good chance they planned out their menu and you don’t want to spring something on them that they were not expecting. In this case, it’s best to bring a gift they can open at a later time, such as a festive set of cocktail napkins.”  Advertisement  If you don’t know someone well, please engage.  An under-appreciated stressor in the art of hosting is the omnipresent question, will everyone get along? As a guest who doesn’t know many people, entering a house full of friends sends you right back to the elementary school playground. So let’s put this in writing.  Guests, won’t you please engage in interesting and meaningful conversation with each other?! Inclusion seems to be taught to children and teenagers (or attempted, at the very least), but what about in adulthood? Sit down next to someone you don’t know and engage! Be it the year(s) of COVID isolation, the comfort in the known or laziness, it seems people have stopped engaging in new interactions.  Hanna Ray Flores and Lea Raymond are the duo behind Hauste, a website dedicated to helping you host the best party. They have some enlightening insight into how to make guests feel comfortable during an intimate dinner party. First, “always offer your guest a beverage upon entering. A drink in hand can break the ice and spark comfort,” they said. Always have a few good dinner party questions in your back pocket: “If conversation is falling flat, don’t hesitate to pull out your go-to dinner party questions like, ‘What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?’ or ‘What is your dream dinner party guest list, dead or alive?’ While it may seem silly to have such ice breaker questions, they usually snowball into conversation that isn’t as easy to catch in a bottle.”  Advertisement  I actually don’t want your help cleaning.",US,5 Things I Expect From My Guests When I Host A Party,,,,0.054,0.708,0.238,0.9998

He said he can’t remember the next 20 days.  The Oscar winner, who was in Atlanta when his health scare occurred, explained that the first doctor who saw him gave him a cortisone shot and sent him home. But Foxx’s sister later took him to another hospital after he appeared “lethargic.”  Advertisement  He said that a doctor at the second hospital told his sister that he was “having a brain bleed that led to a stroke,” and that the doctor told her: “If I don’t go in his head right now, we’re going to lose him.”  Foxx said that doctors were able to confirm he was having a stroke after a procedure, but that they weren’t able to determine where the bleeding in his brain was coming from.  The actor said doctors told his sister at the time that he “may be able to make a full recovery,” but that it was going to be “the worst year” of his life.  Foxx woke up on May 4, 2023. “I found myself in a wheelchair,” he said. “I couldn’t walk.”  Foxx’s daughter Corinne Foxx announced in a statement in April last year that her father was recovering after suffering a “medical complication,” though she didn’t divulge further details about the actor’s health condition.

Advertisement  What is a brain bleed?  A brain bleed, or intracranial hemorrhage, is a type of stroke, the brain equivalent of a heart attack. Brain bleeds are a life-threatening medical emergency that causes blood to pool between the brain and skull, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  There are two main areas where brain bleeds can occur, per the clinic’s website: within your skull, but outside of the brain tissue; or inside the brain tissue. They’re caused by “leaky, broken or burst” blood vessels.  This can happen due to several causes, such as head trauma, a blood clot, a brain tumor or a weak spot in a blood vessel wall, among other reasons.  Advertisement  What are the symptoms of a brain bleed?  The symptoms of a brain bleed include a sudden, painful headache that doesn’t go away and gets worse, as well as vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, pupils that are different sizes and paralysis, according to the Mayo Clinic.  How is a brain bleed diagnosed?  Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans and angiograms, are the best ways to determine the size and position of the bleeding.  Treatment for brain bleeds may include medication or surgery. Some brain hemorrhages may not require surgery, depending on the size, cause and location of the hemorrhage, as well as your general health.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-shapewear-bad-for-your-health_l_67575aefe4b0878021580cb4,Huffington Post,neutral,Politics,,"Cat Gwynn via Getty Images  Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Sarah Hyland have admitted to wearing more than one pair of Spanx shapewear at a time to achieve their ideal shape. Similarly, stars and influencers like Kylie Jenner, Jessica Alba, Nicki Minaj and Coco Austin have promoted waist trainers to get an hourglass figure. Beauty may be pain, but at what cost?  HuffPost spoke to six experts, including doctors and physical therapists, about the good and bad of shapewear and corsetry.  Advertisement  How bad is shapewear for your body?  The most common reason people wear shapewear and corsets is to change their body’s shape and smooth out their appearance. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to look your best, but overdoing it can have serious consequences.  “Shapewear isn’t inherently good or bad — it all depends on how you wear it,” said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a chief medical adviser for Garage Gym Reviews.  Advertisement  Bhasha Mukherjee, a general practitioner and medical correspondent in the U.K., said, “I’ll refer to the old saying: The dose decides the poison. It depends on how many hours you’re wearing it, what kind of waist trainer/corset/shapewear you’re wearing, and how tight it is.”  “At the very least, wearing shapewear daily can result in discomfort, but it could also exacerbate anxiety, poor ventilation in the lungs or even musculoskeletal conditions,” said Dr. Michael Masi, a sports doctor and certified personal trainer. “Any body region where movement is repeatedly restricted over prolonged periods is subject to tissue deprivation, where muscles and tendons become weaker and less resistant to stress.”  “Although the use of shapewear might have specific benefits in certain situations, I never recommend them for day-to-day use,” said Darcie Pervier, a women’s health specialist, physical therapist and owner of Newburyport Wellness.    Let’s see all the different bodily functions they can affect.  Breathing/Lungs  “If [shapewear] is too tight and restricting your diaphragm, it can create difficulty breathing, restrict deep breathing and cause shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness,” said Dr. Laura Purdy, a board-certified family medicine physician.    “You don’t often allow enough space for your lungs to expand when taking a deep breath, so you might end up not taking in enough oxygen,” Mukherjee said. You also might struggle to expel all the air from your lungs, leading to a fainting episode (either from too little oxygen or too much carbon dioxide), she explained.  Advertisement  Stomach  “When shapewear puts pressure on your stomach area, it can cause digestive issues like acid reflux and heartburn because of the acid traveling up the esophagus,” said Purdy. It can also detract from the normal rhythm of organ movement, which can “disrupt how well the diaphragm, liver and gut move and shift.”  Bloomberg via Getty Images Kim Kardashian's Skims has upended the underwear industry, surging to almost $1 billion in net sales in 2023.  Compression garments can also cause a hiatal hernial, ”where part of your stomach is forced up and can protrude through a hole (hiatus) in the chest,” said Amy Cooke, a women’s exercise specialist.  Advertisement  Masi has noticed gut issues come up for a lot of his clients when they wear tight-fitting garments for a prolonged time. “The organs are designed to move and expand to accommodate, propel and mechanically digest food. If restricted, people may experience abdominal pain and digestive issues and may cause or exacerbate conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well,” he said.  Pelvic Floor  With shapewear, Mukherjee said, “essentially, you’re putting more and more pressure on the pelvic floor, which then pushes on the pelvic organs. You can sometimes have difficulty controlling your bladder.”  “Pressure from shapewear can cause the bladder, bowel, uterus and rectum to move lower down, increasing the risk of them prolapsing (bulging) into the vagina,” Cooke said.  Advertisement  “I have seen more than one client managing early-stage uterine prolapse use shapewear without realizing it could negatively impact their symptoms. Sadly, this can cause a mild prolapse to become significantly worse,” warned Cooke.  Skin  Depending on how tight the garment is and how long you wear it, you may experience irritation. “It can cause pressure sores on your skin from the pressure of the garment, which can result in skin irritation,” Mukherjee said.  Nerves  “Some people notice that their muscles feel weaker or sore if they wear shapewear all the time, as it keeps your body from moving naturally,” Dasgupta said.  Advertisement  Shapewear can even cause you to go numb: “If shapewear is too tight and is digging into your skin, it can cause numbness from the pressure on the nerve,” Purdy said.  “As a physical therapist, I sometimes see people with symptoms related to peripheral nerve compression, such as tingling or numbness in the thighs — a condition known as meralgia paresthetica. This results from the compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve [a nerve of the thigh],” Masi said.  Are there any positives that shapewear and corsets offer?  It depends. “Worn occasionally, shapewear can smooth out lines under clothes and offer some light support to your back, which might help you stand up straighter,” Dasgupta said.  Advertisement  Mukherjee noted that shapewear and corsetry may be helpful after any abdominal surgery, including pregnancy. “Your abdominal muscles can become weaker, you can get tears in the fibers in between, and that’s why some women after pregnancy have a physiological hernia. Essentially, the wall of the abdomen isn’t very strong, and your inner organs can poke through. Using a waist trainer can prevent hernias and give extra support to those muscles,” she said.  “Some say it helps with posture by activating and supporting your back,” Purdy said, but noted that shapewear may also weaken the back and abs with extended use.  Mukherjee agreed — ribbed corsets force you to sit upright, which can help you avoid slouching. However, a permanent posture change it’s likely related to habit formation rather than the corset itself, she added.  Advertisement  “Shapewear can also give extra support than might be lacking in the abdominal core muscles,” Mukherjee said, and recommended breathable fabrics, like compression garments, that aren’t too tight and can also help with inflammation of scars or burns.  Exercise and waist trainers  How about those waist trainers that you can wear in the gym to sweat more and shape your waist? Thanks to their shape, waist trainers (which should not be confused with weight-lifting trainer belts used to support your back when weight lifting) are essentially corsets.  The experts agreed that wearing waist trainers or other restrictive clothing while exercising should be avoided for various reasons, including sabotaging your workout.  Advertisement  “Physical activity requires a full range of motion, adequate breathing capacity, and proper core engagement. Restricting the diaphragm can lead to shallow breathing and reduced oxygen intake. The added external support of a corset may reduce the intrinsic support from your core, leading to less engagement and less effective exercise,” Masi said.  Plus, wearing something restrictive while working out will make sweat linger on the skin and may also cause skin barrier irritation or fungal growth, Mukherjee noted.  No type of waist trainer helps with weight loss or fat burn. “The garment doesn’t reduce body fat, increase muscle tone or permanently reshape tissues,” Masi said. “Compression garments are not a substitute for exercise, as they don’t effectively engage the core or other muscles in a way that would lead to long-term body shaping.”  Advertisement  How often should one wear shapewear?  “It is important to recognize that wearing shapewear for a night out is just fine as long as you have no other medical issues,” Pervier said.  If you have to wear shapewear or corsets occasionally, you must pick the right size and ensure they aren’t too tight. It shouldn’t be too restrictive, as that’s when issues arise. “The key is wearing shapewear in moderation and in a size that fits you,” Purdy added.

Many a skin-care-loving, jet-setting traveler has their TSA 3-1-1 game locked down and prepared to face the hectic holiday travel season. Each of their 3.4-ounce liquid, gel and aerosol skin care products is carefully packed in a clear 1-quart zip-top bag and ready for their carry-on bag.  However, with newer skin care products on the market like balms, jellies and sticks, it can be confusing to tell whether or not these products fall under the TSA 3-1-1 liquid rule for checked luggage. Your favorite cleansing balm can hold its shape, so would that mean it’s considered a solid? But cleansing balms can also be spread, so would it be considered a liquid?  Advertisement  And what about other items like sheet masks or powdered forms of skin care? If you have to wait hours to board your delayed flight, can you at least create a little slice of tranquility among the holiday travel chaos with a sheet mask? Or are some of these products at risk of being thrown into the trash at security?  To find out which products are allowed in your carry-on luggage and which you should pack in your checked luggage for holiday travels, HuffPost spoke to Eri Jenkins, a 17-year veteran of the Transportation Security Administration and Uniformed Advisor for TSA Security Operations.  Advertisement  The 411 on TSA’s 3-1-1  If you plan on packing your skin care lotions and potions in your carry-on luggage for your holiday flights, ensure they meet the TSA 3-1-1 rule, with each product packed in a travel-sized container of 3.4 ounces (100 ml) or less. Your products should then fit inside a single 1-quart bag.  Advertisement  While the rules around the carry-on status of your favorite liquid serums and gel night creams are relatively straightforward, some other products might leave travelers scratching their heads as to whether or not the 3-1-1 rule applies.  Cleansing Balms and Jellies  As a good rule of thumb, Jenkins recommends that if you can spread, rub or spray the skin care item, it should adhere to the TSA 3-1-1 rule if you want to pack it into your carry-on luggage.  So if you plan on wowing your family and friends with your favorite cleansing balm at the next big holiday gathering, ensure the container is either under 3.4 ounces or pack it in your checked luggage.  Advertisement  Powdered Skin Care  Powdered forms of skin care are another relatively new addition to the market. Skin care fanatics can find everything from cleansers to serums to even sunscreens in powdered form.  If you like your skin care like you like your donuts (powdered), you’re in luck! The TSA allows travelers to bring up to 12 ounces of powder-like substances in their carry-on luggage. Anything larger might require extra screening.  Jenkins notes that powdered forms of skin care should remain in their pre-mixed, powdered form to comply with the 12-ounce limit for powder-like substances.  Advertisement  Sheet Masks  In case you need a little extra pampering in the boarding area while your flight has been delayed for the third time, according to Jenkins, individually packaged sheet masks are (fortunately) allowed in carry-on luggage.  Baby and makeup wipes also receive the OK from TSA for your carry-on luggage.  Don’t Make These Carry-On Skin Care Mistakes  Opened or unopened, ALL containers must be 3.4 ounces or less.  If you frequently travel through international airports, you may have seen a fellow traveler waltz through security with full-sized skin care products purchased from duty-free.  While these sealed and unopened liquids (skin care and otherwise) from duty-free are allowed through TSA checkpoints under special conditions, don’t assume you can bring your full-sized products from home through the security checkpoint simply because they are unopened.  Advertisement  “The biggest misconception I see with passengers coming through the checkpoint is that an item can be any size as long as it’s not opened, and that’s not true,” Jenkins said. “So even if you have a 12-ounce bottle of lotion that’s still closed and has the manufacturer seal on it, it still will not be able to come through your carry-on bag.”  The TSA goes by container size, not the amount in the container.  Jenkins says another mistake she sees is passengers using a container that is larger than 3.4 ounces to store their skin care products, even when the contents are less than 3.4 ounces. If you pack your skin care in a larger container, you might run the risk of the item not making it past the TSA security checkpoint.  “We go by container size,” Jenkins said.  Even if you only have one ounce of the viral (and very pricey) SK-II essence left in the 11-ounce packaging you snagged from Costco, play it safe and either pack it in your checked luggage or leave it at home for you to enjoy when you return after the holidays.  Advertisement  Give yourself plenty of extra time at the airport.  In the recent past, it was the norm to arrive at the airport two hours before your flight’s departure. But nowadays, you may need to arrive even earlier— particularly during the busy holiday travel season.  Carter Langston, the press secretary for the TSA, cautions that travelers may need to plan to get to the airport even earlier, particularly if they need to return rental vehicles or check baggage during airport “rush hours.”  “Rush hours tend to be early in the morning between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. and in the afternoon between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.,” Langston said.  Advertisement  While arriving early to the airport will allow you to rest a little easier during your holiday travels, Jenkins says budging this extra time will also make the security checkpoint process easier for yourself and TSA officers.  “Travelers should also remember that anytime that they’re coming through the checkpoint, anything that will be in your accessible property could be subjected to additional screening,” Jenkins said.  Just in case a TSA officer needs to make an additional screening at the security checkpoint, Jenkins recommends making everything easier for both yourself and the officer by removing your 1-quart bag of products from your carry-on luggage before sending it through the X-ray machine.  Advertisement  “If [the skin care product] does have to go through additional screening, by it being outside of the bag, it’s easier for the officer to locate it,” Jenkins said.

If you’re an avid traveler, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your passport fill up with stamps, turning that once-blank travel document into a nostalgic little memory book.  But as delightful as it is to have a paper trail of evidence of your past adventures, your large stamp collection could lead to issues on future trips if you don’t pay close attention. That’s all due to a passport validity rule that many people overlook.  Advertisement  “One rule many travelers miss is needing an adequate number of blank pages in their passport for visas, and entry and exit stamps,” David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com, told HuffPost. “This is often forgotten, especially by those with passports close to expiring or having only a few blank pages.”  The U.S. State Department did not set the blank pages rule, which stems from other countries’ requirements for international visitors.  “Some countries require passports to have at least two to four blank visa or stamp pages, and thus, some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met,” said Caroline Tanner, a trends writer at The Points Guy.  Advertisement  Just as travelers often need to have at least three to six months of passport validity beyond the dates of an international trip, they may also need to have a certain number of empty pages depending on the requirements at their destination.  “The basis for this rule is maintaining proper security measures and part of the entry and exit requirements,” Alwadish said. “Not meeting this requirement can cause problems at borders. If the traveler does not have the required blank pages in the passport, the passport will technically be invalid and the person may not be allowed to board the plane.”  He emphasized that airlines can bar passengers who do not meet the requirement from boarding their flights to avoid complications at the international destination.  Advertisement  “If for whatever reason it is overlooked in the U.S., the traveler may take a big risk once they arrive at their destination country, as every border patrol officer has the right to determine the outcome,” Alwadish explained. “They may have travelers detained, pay a fine or let them pass.”  Taking that kind of risk in a foreign country is not advisable, he added. And there’s a long list of countries that have this rule in place. Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Germany, India, Belgium, South Africa, the Netherlands, Cuba, Iceland, Zimbabwe and Indonesia are among the destinations that require two blank pages. Countries that require one page include France, Japan, Mexico, Greece, Thailand, Australia, Morocco, Argentina and Vietnam, among others. But you’ll need at least three blank pages if you want to visit Namibia, Botswana, Madagascar and Zambia.  “While some pages may be full of stamps, others might have one ― and just one stamp means that that page is not empty,” Alwadish cautioned.  Advertisement  Immigration authorities in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have also emphasized that the “endorsement” pages found at the back of many passports are different from visa pages and thus do not count as blank pages for the purposes of entry and exit stamps. (Newer passports have the endorsement section closer to the front.)  Meanwhile, Armenia and Micronesia have no stated blank passport page requirements.  “Countries like Sweden and the Philippines don’t require a blank page on your passport, but rather sufficient space for entry and exit stamps,” Alwadish noted.  He recommended looking at the State Department’s website for a breakdown of the specific entry prerequisites for each country.  Advertisement  Jake Wyman via Getty Images Many avid travelers delight in their extensive collections of passport stamps, but it's important to check the blank page requirements before visiting an international destination.  Keep in mind that blank page rules don’t just apply to U.S. visitors, either.  “This is true for all incoming travelers to the country, regardless of nationality, based on requirements set by individual countries for incoming visitors,” Tanner said.  Over time, frequent travelers may not need to worry as much about having enough empty passport pages.  Advertisement  “The issue of blank passport pages will likely become less of a significant problem for travelers as more countries are phasing out manual stamping of physical passport books,” Alwadish said. “The European Union is spearheading this shift with the introduction of the Entry/Exit System, intended to expedite the border control process and improve data accuracy.”  He explained that this new system uses biometric technology to scan travelers’ fingerprints and faces at border checkpoints.  “This data will then be stored and used to verify their arrival and exits, cross referenced with their passport information, removing the necessity for physical passport stamps,” he said.  Advertisement  But for now, immigration officers still need to ensure there are enough pages for stamps and visas. So travelers must remain vigilant.  “It is always best to make sure your passport is valid and has at least two blank pages,” Alwadish noted. “If a traveler does not have enough blank pages available, they cannot add more to their physical book.”  As of 2016, the U.S. government does not allow travelers to add extra pages to their existing passports. If they need more pages, they must renew their passports.  Advertisement  People who often travel internationally might want to consider choosing the option for a bigger passport with more visa pages. It’s no extra cost, and all you have to do is check the box that says “large book” when you fill out the form.  If you have an impending trip abroad, there are ways to get a new passport in a rush on your own or by paying a third party for expedited service. And of course, the best way to avoid adding extra stress and hassle is to keep track of your passport and ensure it’s compliant throughout the year.",US,The 1 Big Mistake You Should Avoid With Your Passport,,,,0.049,0.874,0.077,0.9863
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/queef-vagina-fart-flatulence-sex-ano_l_675ca50fe4b08821cba78ed8,Huffington Post,neutral,International,,"Cavan Images via Getty Images Flatulence from your vagina during sex or physical activities like yoga is common and nothing to be ashamed of.  Queefing, as anyone with a vagina will tell you, can happen at some inopportune times: while you’re having sex, in the middle of a yoga class or during a visit to the gynecologist.  You may have heard some people refer to queefs as “vaginal farts” (charming). But while queefs do produce a toot-like sound, we can assure you that queefing is not the same as passing gas.  Advertisement  We talked to gynecologists and sex therapists to learn more about what causes queefs, some of the misconceptions about them and why they shouldn’t be as mortifying as we make them out to be.  What makes you queef, anyway?  Queefing is an involuntary bodily function that occurs when air is pushed into the vagina, gets temporarily trapped in the folds of the vaginal canal (called rugae) and is then released.  Advertisement  “Queefing happens when a penis, fingers or sex toy go in and out of the vagina bringing additional air along with it,” Sherry A. Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, California and the author of “She-ology: The Definitive Guide to Women’s Intimate Health,” told HuffPost. “Sex can involve a lot of thrusting of the penis in and out of the vagina, typically pushing extra air into a dead-end space.”  Certain sex positions, like doggy style where your pelvis is titled upwards, or abruptly switching from one position to another, may increase the likelihood of queefing. Even non-sexual activities, like putting in a tampon or menstrual cup, practicing yoga (like when you move out of an inversion pose) or your gyno inserting a speculum can lead to queefing.  “From my experience as an OB-GYN, almost every woman has experienced at least one episode of queefing some time during her life, sometimes even during a pelvic exam,” said Diana Hoppe, an OB-GYN in Encinitas, California.  While the gas that comes out of your rectum may have a foul odor (a result of bacterial activity in the gut), queefs are odorless, Hoppe added.  Advertisement  Can you prevent a queef?  And as OB-GYN Sheila Loanzon told Cosmopolitan, “If you try to contract the vaginal canal to prevent air from coming in, it can cause sex to be more painful.”  Advertisement  “Also, when doing any abdominal exercises or weight-bearing exercise, it is important to squeeze the pelvic floor while holding the core abdominal muscles tight,” Hoppe said. “Many women squeeze abdominal muscles but do not activate the pelvic floor at the same time, thus allowing the pelvic floor to sag, increasing the likelihood of air entering into vaginal canal.”  During sex, keeping the penis, fingers or sex toy inside you while you change positions could lessen your chances of queefing because it “gives air less of an opportunity to get into the vagina,” Jamil Abdur-Rahman, an OB-GYN and the chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vista Health System in Waukegan, Illinois, told Self.  Advertisement  And in theory, you could just avoid certain sex or yoga positions altogether. But what’s the fun in that?  When queefing does happen, don’t sweat it.  So why does this very normal bodily function feel so embarrassing in the moment, be it during doggy-style or downward dog? It really just comes down to that pesky noise, Hoppe said.  “The stigma is due to lack of understanding the difference between release of air from the vagina and flatulence,” she said. “The sound effects may be the same though, so culturally there may be a stigma or embarrassment due to this occurring ‘down there.’”  Advertisement  Sex therapist Vanessa Marin underscored the fact that queefing is normal, common and “not anything to be ashamed of.” Embracing the awkwardness of the moment can even make sex more enjoyable for both partners.  “Our bodies make funny noises sometimes, and that’s OK!” she said. “Plus, there are plenty of other goofy things about sex, like getting sweaty, slipping out, getting into awkward positions and so on. The more we can laugh about these kinds of things, the more fun we’ll have during sex.”  When a queef slips out mid-coitus, you have two choices: ignore that deflating balloon sound completely or quickly acknowledge it and move on. Marin prefers the latter route.  Advertisement  “It’s a personal preference, but I think it’s better to just quickly acknowledge it and laugh it off,” she said. “That way you don’t have to sit there thinking about it, anxiously wondering whether or not your partner heard it.”  Is queefing ever cause for concern?  Generally, queefing is nothing to be worried about. While rare, if queefing is accompanied by pain or a bad smell, you should make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any more serious issues.  “If queefing is associated with a foul odor, it may be an indication of a vaginal infection or possible fistula, an [abnormal] connection between rectum and vagina due to previous radiation treatment or surgery that causes stool or feces to come out of the vagina,” Hoppe said.  Advertisement  But for the most part, queefing is a normal, if slightly awkward, fact of life. So let’s not get so hung up on it, OK?",US,"Here’s Why You Queef During Sex.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

(AP) — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.

(Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery.

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

Left: Amazon MGM Studios; Right: Roadside Attractions  Unless folks are doing something like recording whole scenes of a movie on their cellphones, you generally don’t notice who else is in the audience with you at a movie theater. The lights fade to black, the screen brightens and everything — and everyone — around you virtually disappears. But sometimes taking stock of how others react to a film can tell you a lot about who becomes the arbiters of merit and why.  That’s especially true when you’re watching a Black movie.  An example that comes to mind is “12 Years a Slave,” which tells the harrowing true story of a free Black man who was abducted and sold into slavery in 1841. At a 2013 press screening for the film in Manhattan, an inclusive audience sat transfixed in front of the screen during multiple scenes of sexual and physical violence.  Advertisement  Perusing the theater during those moments revealed something interesting. Some Black viewers were stone-faced, while others seemed exhausted by the second or third brutality scene. Many of the white folks, though, were inconsolable — sobbing and blowing their noses. Perhaps that was on account of white guilt, a performative impulse, or because the film really is that stirring.  In any case, “12 Years a Slave,” a Steve McQueen-directed movie that unflinchingly portrays the horrors of white supremacy, was heralded by a predominantly white and so-called liberal Hollywood elite. And it went on to earn nine Oscar nominations.  There was another staggering Black drama released that same year that was also a nonfiction story dealing with systemic racism, though in a more modern context: “Fruitvale Station.” It earned exactly zero nominations from that same voting branch.  Advertisement  While the Ryan Coogler-directed film can hardly be accused of not engaging with the issue of whiteness through the lens of police brutality, there is a crucial difference between it and the aforementioned offering. It does not hinge on the racially motivated atrocity against its lead character or its perpetrator. Rather, it centers the Black human life that was cut short. It examines who the person was outside of the system of whiteness.  Ethan Herisse (left) and Brandon Wilson in ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  In essence, it’s not a film that necessarily brings white audiences into its story. It actually seems indifferent to whatever reaction they might have. A Hollywood voting establishment that, in spite of all its lip service, has always had an issue appreciating art that does not revolve around their lives or even their ills could see that as a detriment.  Advertisement  They often look for art they can laud that can at least give the appearance that they’re progressive despite showing all signs of the opposite. It’s a self-gratifying tactic that doesn’t serve the art at all, no matter how good it is.  It’s been over a decade since “12 Years a Slave” and “Fruitvale Station” were released, and white people’s proximity to a Black narrative still weighs heavily on their acclaim for it. This year’s “Nickel Boys” and “Exhibiting Forgiveness” are two other Black films that have had parallel journeys to the big screen and awards season. But their trajectories could not be more different — and for the same reason as their predecessors.  Similar to “12 Years a Slave,” “Nickel Boys,” an adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, is an unrelenting drama following the lives of two young Black men trying to survive an abusive and racist reform school in the 1960s. The performances are good. The movie’s technical merit, including its marvelous cinematography, has already helped it earn the attention of several awards bodies.  Advertisement  Despite it not even being released in limited theaters until Friday, there’s hardly a day that goes by in the last few months — since its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival this summer — that there isn’t press or hype about it. That includes numerous press screenings and initiatives.  But with the effects of systemic oppression being an impeding factor of the story, leaving little space to explore the characters’ humanity, it’s hard not to again wonder whether its appeal to arbitrated audiences is also that it is more for them to appreciate than others who might identify with their experiences.  André Holland (left) and Andra Day in ""Exhibiting Forgiveness."" Courtesy of Roadside Attractions  Advertisement  Director RaMell Ross said he didn’t intend for that to be the case, though. When the filmmaker was asked in an interview with Vanity Fair what his expectations are of audiences that are “older, very white and wealthier,” he replied that “Nickel Boys” “emerges from our centrality, and it ostensibly is for us, but I’m happy to give it to others.”  “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” on the other hand, doesn’t provoke that same question. It almost entirely wrestles with the complexities of its Black characters, and in ways Black audiences especially recognize. Systemic prejudices are understood as the reality in which they live, only because they are Black and it’s set in the present day, not because the plot informs that. There’s nary a moment when the film even gestures toward that to tell its story.  That helps create an intensely insulated film that centers a Black family whose drama is also deeply felt and astoundingly performed. The conflicts, joy and contradictions that propel the plot are of their own making — and not the result of a racially motivated antagonist. White people, come to think of it, are merely ornamental in the story.  Advertisement  It is unequivocally a film by and for Black people to grapple with among ourselves — one that has similarly affected Black audiences in the way “12 Years a Slave” moved white viewers. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” allows white audiences to enter its narrative incidentally only, while films like “Nickel Boys” and “12 Years a Slave” often engage directly with their white audiences through their own historical (and present-day) examination.  It’s a distinction that often results in the latter films being considered worthy of Hollywood’s highest honors.  Taking a look at the theatrical and post-theatrical odysseys of “Exhibiting Forgiveness” and “Nickel Boys” might help bring this into further focus. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is an original story that was amazingly green-lit in our sequel- and adaptation-obsessed culture and based on the personal experiences of writer-director Titus Kaphar, a first-time feature filmmaker.  Advertisement  “Nickel Boys” came with all the fanfare of a known author, an acclaimed literary honor under its belt and at least the assumption that its Jim Crow-era setting means that whiteness could obviously play a significant role in the story. Even Ross’ avant-garde filmmaking that shifts the camera and perspective between the two lead characters couldn’t deter an audience that was already locked in.  Herisse stars as Elwood in a moment from ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  Ross also told Vanity Fair that the process between the film being green-lit and going into production through Orion Pictures and Amazon MGM Studios was fairly smooth, to his own surprise. And since its Telluride premiere just a few months ago, “Nickel Boys” has experienced a constant whirlwind of praise from various awards bodies and audiences.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, Kaphar told me during an interview that “it was a fight” to get “Exhibiting Forgiveness” released in theaters. Like many filmmakers, especially Black filmmakers whose work is too often considered niche, Kaphar was approached about bringing the film to a streaming service.  Despite earning rave reviews following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it went months without being acquired, and then months later — not until October — it was released by Roadside Attractions. By then, many people had forgotten about it or just hadn’t heard much about it at all.  Save from a video-on-demand release and awards screeners available to voting press, the film hasn’t been able to achieve any major award nominations and hasn’t popped up on most “best of 2024” lists. (It made HuffPost’s roundup.) Unlike “Fruitvale Station,” it also failed to earn an Independent Spirit Award nomination or other award precursor nominations.  Advertisement  None of this discussion is to elevate any one Black film above another, suggest that a certain kind of Black film is better than the next, or even pit two films against each other. Both can and should be in the conversation.

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.

Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads.

National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon’s impeachment was an outcome driven by “the people’s ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.”  Advertisement  Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, “We have preserved the constitutional order!”  In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached. Both rallies have largely been peaceful.

(AP Photo/Ahnn Young-joon) Ahn Young-joon via AP  The new leader bolsters the country’s security posture  Yoon issued a statement saying he would “never give up” and calling for officials to maintain stability in government functions during what he described as a “temporary” pause of his presidency.  “I will carry with me all the criticisms, encouragement and support directed toward me, and I will continue to do my utmost for the country until the very last moment,” Yoon said.  Advertisement  Han, who became the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han’s office.  South Korea’s executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade and finance and was the ambassador to the U.S. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.  Advertisement  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred.  Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law.  The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon “committed rebellion that hurts peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.” It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.  Advertisement  Yoon remains defiant  In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon had rejected the rebellion charges, calling his order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it “a monster” and “anti-state forces” that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.  Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a “mad declaration of war” against his own people.  Observers say Yoon’s speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon’s approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.  Advertisement  Some of Yoon’s claims don’t align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.  Most notably, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that after martial law was announced, Yoon called him and asked for his troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he didn’t carry out Yoon’s orders.  Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.  Advertisement  In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers. Roh jumped to his death in 2009, after he had left office, amid a corruption scandal involving his family.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea.  He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations.",US,South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol Impeached After Martial Law Order,,,,0.135,0.765,0.099,-0.9932

If the news these days overwhelms you, you’re hardly alone: America is as politically polarized as ever. Almost every day, there’s a new controversial Cabinet pick from President-elect Donald Trump. There are drawn-out wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and here in the U.S., some say we’re on the edge of a looming class war.  In short, we are living in bizarre, capital-letter Unprecedented Times. If you’re able to block it all out and not take on the stress, you’re lucky.  Advertisement  A week after Trump won the election, independent journalist Marisa Kabas wrote on Bluesky about how frenzied the news cycle makes her feel.  “There has to be a better way than sounding an alarm every single time a deranged Trump-related story drops,” she said. “It’s unhealthy and unsustainable. We need to find a way to stay informed without spiking cortisol and without losing sight of the bigger picture. I’m just...not sure how.”  Advertisement  A month later, Kabas says she’s still considering this question.  “When there’s a deluge of really intense news, I know my instinct is often ‘make it stop.’ But since I know the news is never going to stop, I’ve been trying in those moments to think instead of momentarily putting it aside,” said Kabas, who publishes The Handbasket, a newsletter about politics, media and power.  Advertisement  Kabas think people need to remind themselves that just because news is available to them at all times doesn’t mean they’re required to consume it. You can gauge your personal limit and clock out when you need to.  “This isn’t to say ignorance is bliss; at this really scary moment in history, some tolerance for distress is required to avoid being complicit in allowing this country to passively slide all the way into fascism,” she told HuffPost. “But if you’re overwhelmed, choose a few outlets you trust and read them as often as you find tolerable.”  What other steps can you take to manage the emotional impact stressful news has on you?

(In other words, go outside and maybe take a walk.)  “When I feel overwhelmed by the news, one of the most grounding things I do is take a step back from consuming media and reconnect with nature and my community.

For me, that often looks like hitting a local trail with my queer chosen family. We hike, talk and hold space for each other as we navigate these challenging times. It’s a reminder that even in uncertainty, we have the power to create moments of connection and care.

Advertisement  Choose a few issues you’re interested in and keep your news intake limited to those.  “One approach is to choose an issue or two that matter most to you and stick to news on those topics to avoid the sense that all the news is bad. I’ve found that can be more mentally manageable and also helps you become more learned in specific areas. Win/win.” ― Kabas  Focus on things that bring you joy, give you perspective and that are in your control.  “I step away from the news and focus in on the things in life that bring me joy (my infant son, my wife, our friends and family, music, running), give me perspective (the woods, the ocean, our long history as a resilient and adaptive trans community), and that I can control (how I show up for myself, my family, and my community, and the contributions I make every day in ways big and small to the collective and enduring effort to create a more peaceful and inclusive world).

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/should-you-open-bottle-of-wine-host-gift_l_6744ac9be4b0b7647d8a1385,Huffington Post,neutral,International,,"Lorenzo Conti For HuffPost  When visiting a friend’s house for dinner or a party, it’s a common tradition to bring a gift for the host. This might be a bouquet of flowers, a scented candle or even a bottle of wine. But sometimes, a gifted item of food or drink can cause miscommunication between hosts and guests.  For instance, if a host thanks their guest for bringing a bottle of wine, but it never appears on the communal bar or dinner table, does that mean the host isn’t happy with the gift?  Advertisement  What are the rules and guidelines around edible and drinkable gifts, and how can hosts clearly communicate their expectations? To answer these questions, we turned to a group of modern etiquette experts and event professionals.  Serving or not serving gifted items is totally up to the host.  The first thing to remember about bringing a gift to a party is that, once given, the gift becomes the sole property of the host, and what happens to it is up to them.  Advertisement  “Host gifts, whether it is a bottle of wine, a handmade food item or a box of candy, are not expected to be opened and offered at the gathering unless the guest and host have discussed it and agreed to do so,” confirmed Renate Devin, the owner of the Boston School of Etiquette.  Jamila Musayeva, a certified etiquette coach and the author of “The Art of Entertaining at Home,” agreed, adding that “when you bring a bottle of wine, homemade cookies or any edible item as a gift, it’s thoughtful to remember that this is a gesture of appreciation, not an expectation for it to be served immediately. Hosts usually have planned their menu and wine selection, so a well-chosen gift is best viewed as something for them to enjoy later, unless they specifically ask you to contribute to the party offerings. It is up to the host to serve or open what the guest has brought because the host is in charge of planning the menu and deciding how and what to serve — particularly pairing of beverages with food.”  So if your friend doesn’t open the bottle of pinot noir that you brought to dinner, don’t take it personally. They’re likely planning to save it for another time!  The host should communicate whether guests are expected to contribute a dish or drink to the party.  Sit-down dinner events and potluck dinners abide by specific rules, but many house parties fall into a nebulous middle ground. Food will be served and the host is planning to provide the mains, but if a guest wants to contribute a side dish or a dessert (or a bottle of vino), the addition is often encouraged.  Advertisement  As a host, providing clear communication can chase away any doubts or misunderstandings about what a guest should bring, or whether they should bring something at all.  “If a host has thoughts or opinions on what guests should bring, they should communicate the expectation in advance,” suggested Melissa Ben-Ishay, the founder and CEO of the company Baked by Melissa. “Oftentimes, when my own guests ask what they can bring, I give them a category. Bring dessert, or bring an adult beverage — this helps the host weave these things into the serving plan.”  You can even be more specific with your guests about which items would be helpful for the meal, said Christine Schaub, the host of “Come on Over,” a web series that is available on YouTube and focuses on home entertaining. Schaub said that such a conversation might go like this: “A pinot grigio would pair beautifully with the salad course. Would you like to bring a bottle?” Then, if the guest asks “for a suggested vintner, be ready with affordable suggestions,” she added.  Advertisement  And if a guest shows up at your door with a gift but you’re not sure whether it’s intended to be shared at the party, Schaub said that you can pick up on some clues from the presentation. “If a beverage arrives in a gift bag, it is truly a gift — not a shareable,” she advised, noting that the same goes for food items.“It’s entirely up to the host whether to serve or save it for another time. If a beverage arrives hot or chilled (in an insulated tote), that’s your tip that [it was intended to] ... be served.”  It might seem tacky to include details about gifts in an invitation (since you as the host may not want guests to think that you expect a present), but Musayeva said there’s a way to express your preferred policy without seeming like a gift-grubber.  “If you’re hosting and prefer not to incorporate gifts into the event’s refreshments, feel free to mention it in a warm and subtle way ahead of time,” Musayeva suggested. “A quick message like ‘Looking forward to seeing everyone! Your presence is the best gift, but if you do bring something special, I’d love to enjoy it later on my own’ makes it clear without any pressure.”  Advertisement  Guests can also take the initiative to ask whether they should bring something.  Hosts have a lot of elements to juggle when preparing for a dinner or a party, so invitation details can sometimes fall by the wayside. If you receive an invite but still aren’t sure whether to bring a dish or a drink, don’t hesitate to shoot the host a quick text message or email.  “It is recommended to ask the host beforehand if one can contribute in any way to the party and what would be most suitable,” Musayeva pointed out. “Perhaps extra portions of cookies or fruits would be appreciated, or beverages. If that is the case, then it is acceptable to assume the host will serve what you brought.”  If you want to give an edible gift while avoiding ambiguity, stay clear of baked goods and wine.  Since gifts like wine and cookie platters could go either way in a “to serve immediately or not?” debate, you might consider a different option to prevent the host from wondering if your offering is meant to be shared.  Advertisement  Shannon Smith, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based private chef and the author of “The Hidden Table,” said possible food and drink gifts may include “gourmet olive oil or balsamic vinegar, artisan chocolates, or infused sea salts or seasonings.” On a similar note, Ben-Ishay said that she likes to “make homemade vanilla extract a year in advance and use that as a gift to bring [to parties]. It always feels extra special when it’s homemade.”  Musayeva noted that “when choosing a gift for a host, keeping their dietary preferences or alcohol choices in mind shows true thoughtfulness. Always bear in mind the religious/cultural background of the host, as alcoholic beverages and foods containing pork or cow meat might not be acceptable.”  A ‘no takebacks’ or ‘no givebacks’ policy always applies to party gifts.  Say a guest brings a bottle of wine to your dinner party, but you already have beverages mapped out for the night. If you’re tempted to hand the bottle back to your guest as they’re leaving, stop right there.  Advertisement  “It would be rude of the host to even attempt to give it back,” said August Abbott, an etiquette expert with the website JustAnswer. “This is a very, very common mistake.” Keep that bottle for later enjoyment (or regifting), but sending it back with the guest who presented it could be viewed as insulting.",US,Is It Rude If Your Dinner Party Host Didn't Open The Bottle Of Wine You Brought?,,,,0.022,0.793,0.186,0.9997

While it’s true that traveling with little ones will be different than what you’re used to, it’s still possible to indulge your wanderlust and explore new places as a family.  As you may have gathered from your paltry parental leave, the U.S. is not always the most welcoming country for families with children. Many other nations show more consideration for kids and parents in both their public policies and their cultural practices. Not all of these locales feature bathroom changing tables or stroller-friendly streets, but there is often a shared expectation that kids will be integrated into daily life, whether they’re riding public transit, dining out or visiting a national monument.  During one of our early forays abroad as parents, my wife and I took our 1-year-old to the Dominican Republic. We looked pretty ridiculous maneuvering our stroller through the cobblestone streets of old Santo Domingo, but everyone we interacted with was helpful and kind. A waiter in a traditional restaurant even picked up our baby and cheerfully walked around with him for a bit so that we could use both hands to enjoy our food. All our fellow diners got to watch our son return their smiles and bestow on him the standard “Dios le bendiga” (“God bless him”) that Dominicans offer every child who crosses their path.  Advertisement  Marie Holmes The author's son awaits lunch at a comedor in the Dominican Republic.  If you’re itching to roam beyond the U.S. with your kids, here are some recommendations from families with lots of travel experience. Of course, not every part of any country will be suited for kids, but these families were able to find child-friendly spots for making memories.  “The most important thing to remember there is that countries are not monoliths, and some parts of a city may be perfectly safe while others are not,” digital nomad and mom Courtney Orgias told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The Dominican Republic  In addition to a child-friendly culture, the all-inclusive resorts in beachy places like Puerto Plata can simplify life for families traveling with young ones.  “You don’t have to worry about lugging a carseat to multiple places or renting a car. They also typically have toddler pools, kids areas, activities and sometimes childcare. The buffets offer a variety of foods so there’s a good chance you’ll find something the baby/toddler will enjoy. The rooms also typically come with refrigerators for storing the baby’s food and milk,” Stephanie Claytor, founder of the brand Blacktrekking, told HuffPost.  Jamaica  Claytor mentions that similar all-inclusive accommodations, alongside white sand beaches and turquoise Caribbean water, are available in Jamaica.  Advertisement  “We took our son to Negril for his second birthday. Our favorite memory is of him dancing on the beach to reggae music during the all-white party on his birthday. We had no idea he could bust a move. He loved the party and reggae music. We of course were in the back away from the crowded dance floor but were still able to enjoy the DJ,” said Claytor.  She recommends looking for places that offer refrigerators (for breastfeeding parents who need to pump milk), ample shade and outdoor dining — “so that I’m not embarrassed when my son breaks out in loud singing or accidentally throws some food.”  With young children, almost any place can be kid-friendly. “Toddlers and babies are amused by the simplest things such as wood chips and stairways,” Claytor said. So if there’s a destination you’re keen to visit with your little one, you can probably find a way to make it work — just be ready to spend an afternoon collecting rocks instead of devouring your novel in the sun.  Advertisement  “Try to get out of your head any images of long afternoons lounging by the pool sipping cocktails,” said British travel blogger Jenny Lynn. “As a parent traveling with kids you still have to be ‘on,’” she continued. “But traveling provides you with a constantly changing backdrop to take on those daily parent chores, and with new adventures to experience together, daily life becomes all the more rewarding.”  Stephanie Claytor Claytor with her husband and child in Jamaica.  Portugal  “Lisbon can seem intimidating to explore with small kids because of all the hills — nobody wants to carry a toddler or push a stroller up a 30% incline — but we were able to take the bus to most places and found it to be efficient and clean; there were stops everywhere,” said Orgias.  Advertisement  Ample parks and green spaces allowed the kids to get their wiggles out and break up a day of sightseeing, she added.  Mexico  Public transportation also makes Mexico City (Mexico D.F.) more navigable for families, according to Orgias. It “has a great train system we were able to utilize and it’s very walkable, with lots of wonderful neighborhoods that are easy to explore on foot,” she said.  Advertisement  “Worrying about traveling with car seats and hopping in and out of ride shares and taxis is scary for a lot of parents,” she explained, but good public transportation options can allay these concerns.  Costa Rica  If your kids eat rice and beans, they’ll have always something to nosh on with gallo pinto at every meal. Maria De la O of Roam Family Travel told HuffPost that year-round access to fresh fruit also made it easy to keep kids satisfied.  There’s plenty to see, between the jungle and the beach. De la O and her family booked a tour via National Geographic Expeditions with local guides and saw about 20 different animals during their stay.  Advertisement  “We of course stayed in hotels with pools and allowed at least an hour or two a day just for the kids to do that,” she added.  Canada  “The CN Tower, Centre Island and the many summer festivals in the city all present opportunities for novelty, learning and bonding in Toronto. It’s a city with so much cultural diversity that there’s always something to do, indoor & outdoor,” said Orgias.  Advertisement  For animal lovers, Toronto features a zoo and an aquarium. In warmer months, you can take the ferry to Toronto Island Park and enjoy bike trails, picnic areas and even an amusement park. You can also tour Niagara Falls from Toronto.  On the French-Canadian side, Montreal offers plenty of parks, museums and historical sites to keep the whole family occupied. If you’re looking for European-style flair and cobblestone streets, check out Quebec City a bit further north.  Namibia  “Namibia gets our vote as one of the best places for intrepid family travel,” said Lynn, the U.K. travel blogger quoted above. She recommends forgoing an organized tour and instead renting your own 4x4 with roof tents. “The quality of roads is generally very good and the campsites are seriously fantastic (there’s often a pool),” she added.  Advertisement  In addition to “lunar landscapes” and safari wildlife, Namibia offers “a low malaria risk, good health care, German bakeries in every town, and an amazing climate,” Lynn said.  Morocco  “It’s so close to Europe, yet feels a world away with vibrant medinas, sweeping apricot-colored deserts, and jagged snow capped mountains,” Lynn said.  Advertisement  Orgias said some of her favorite memories are of Morocco: “When our kids were 9 months and 3 years we spent Christmas Day riding camels and hiking through the Atlas Mountains in Marrakech. It was such a surreal experience to be able to gift them with these amazing bucket list activities.”  She described Marrakech as “a fast paced city that allows kids and  adults alike to get wrapped up in the blend of rich cultures.”  Lynn said the country is “very doable” by car.  “Kids will love sandboarding in the Sahara Desert, trekking the Atlas Mountains on a mule, or surfing the waves in Essaouira” — a coastal town Lynn found remarkably stroller-friendly.  Advertisement  Thailand  “Thailand is easily one of the most accessible countries we’ve visited with the boys,” said Lynn. Her family enjoyed “the energy, the ornate temples, the colorful markets, the polite people and the food… and of course the incredible beaches!”  Thailand boasts a plethora of street vendors selling delicious snacks. Lynn says her kids enjoyed sticky rice, banana pancakes, mango and other tropical fruits.  Advertisement  “Many restaurants, even along the once-backpacker enclave of Th Khao San, have highchairs, and we found that some beach restaurants in Ko Lanta have toys and kids’ play areas,” she said.  The Netherlands  Orgias recommends Amsterdam for families taking their first journey abroad together, describing it as “safe, clean” and friendly to speakers of English.  Advertisement  “The city is walkable, offers lots of child-friendly museums and activities,” she said.  And if you get the itch to venture out even further, Paris is just a 3.5-hour train ride away!  De la O recommended European destinations in general for travel with a baby. “Pushing a sleeping child in a stroller or walking them in a Baby Bjorn or baby backpack is a perfect way to sightsee, so take advantage of the museums and Gothic churches you won’t be able to enjoy when your child gets a little older.”",US,10 Destinations To Consider For Your Next Family Vacation,,,,0.02,0.82,0.16,0.9998

It only makes sense, then, that produce-forward meal plans protect your cardiovascular health. These diets are known to help control risk factors for heart disease like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. (However, medication is necessary sometimes, too.)  Advertisement  The Mediterranean diet is a common heart-healthy approach, but there’s another option that may also be key to lowering your cholesterol and your risk of coronary artery disease: the portfolio diet.  Below, experts share the rundown on this plant-forward meal plan and why it’s worth trying.  What is the portfolio diet?  “The portfolio diet was proposed about 20 years ago, and it has a lot in common with other heart-healthy diets that that you heard of, such as a Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet and a whole food, plant-based diet,” said Dr. Sarah Hull, an associate professor of medicine in cardiology at Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut.  Advertisement  “The name comes from the fact that this diet includes a portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods, so foods that reduce mostly the bad cholesterol in the diet,” noted Kristina Petersen, an associate professor in the department of nutritional sciences at Pennsylvania State University.  The portfolio diet is made up of four different food profiles, Melissa Prest, a clinical nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told HuffPost via email. It encourages the consumption of plant-based protein, plant sterols (a natural compound that helps lower cholesterol levels), soluble fiber and monounsaturated fat.  This means “eating a lot of foods like beans, lentils, soy, nuts and seeds, fruits, vegetables and whole grains as a way to obtain those foods, which basically, again, is very similar to whole food plant-based diet,” Hull said.  Some other heart-healthy diets, like the Mediterranean diet and the DASH eating plan, also include animal products like fish and poultry, and dairy products like yogurt and cheese. But the portfolio diet is vegan — which means if you intend to follow the diet exactly, you’ll need to remove any animal products from your rotation.  Advertisement  The portfolio diet specifically focuses on cholesterol, so it’s a good option if you struggle with that.  According to Petersen, the portfolio diet is not as well-studied as the Mediterranean diet, but the data that is available shows it can significantly benefit your cardiovascular health.  “There have been several studies done where they’ve shown pretty substantial lowering of LDL cholesterol ― so the bad cholesterol that increases risk of heart disease ― with this diet,” Petersen said. “In the original study, the lowering was about 29% in four weeks.”  Advertisement  “And then [researchers] did a subsequent study where they actually compared following this diet with lovastatin, which is a pharmaceutical agent to lower cholesterol, and they actually saw a pretty comparable lowering of LDL,” Petersen said. “So we have quite a bit of evidence that it lowers LDL cholesterol, and this is really what the diet is best known for.”  There are still health rewards even if you just add parts of the portfolio diet to your lifestyle. “Each of the four portfolios can reduce cholesterol levels by 5-10%,” Prest said.  Lowering bad cholesterol is “an important part of preventing and treating cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and stroke,” Hull said.  Advertisement  Research also shows that people who follow the portfolio diet are 14% less likely to develop coronary heart disease and have a stroke, according to the American Heart Association.  There are also other health benefits to the portfolio diet: It’s anti-inflammatory and can help people reach their daily fiber goal (most Americans are fiber deficient), Hull said. Women need between 21 and 25 grams of fiber each day, and men need between 30 and 38 grams daily.  martin-dm via Getty Images Nuts and seeds are a key part of this heart-healthy diet.  Advertisement  Here’s how you can take steps to add the portfolio diet to your lifestyle:  “Thinking about making incremental changes rather than making huge, sweeping changes is one of the most important principles to keep in mind,” Hull said. “So, the first thing is to think about [is], ‘What’s my biggest barrier to incorporating healthy changes?’”  If money is an issue, consider buying frozen fruits and veggies instead of fresh — they’ll last longer and are usually cheaper than the fresh alternative, Hull suggested. Bulk dried legumes, such as beans and lentils, are also more economical, she noted.  If your issue is time, consider meal prepping on the weekends, and look up plant-based, make-ahead recipes. Or if you just don’t know how to prep plant-based meals, consider talking to your doctor or a dietitian.  Advertisement  You can start small by focusing on one meal a day. For example, you could begin by eating oatmeal topped with nuts or seeds for breakfast, Petersen said. Or you could try following the portfolio diet at lunch by making grain bowls with quinoa or brown rice topped with chickpeas, veggies and tofu.  Even just snacking on unsalted nuts, apples and peanut butter, or carrots and hummus is part of this diet, Hull noted.  The portfolio diet still has benefits even if you don’t completely follow it.  Let’s be real: Going from a meat-based diet to a totally vegan meal plan is a big ask. Luckily, you don’t have to go fully vegan to see cardiovascular benefits.  Advertisement  “I think you can still incorporate the key features of the portfolio diet [such as whole grains, nuts, vegetables, beans and fruit] without excluding animal products if you want to include those,” Petersen said. “We have a lot of evidence for viscous fiber, plant sterols, soy and nuts reducing cholesterol levels, so if you just ate more of those foods, you would see cholesterol lowering.”  It’s true that you’ll get the greatest health benefits out of this diet if you follow it to the letter. But even just following it when you can is also good for you.  “The more adherent you can be to a diet like the portfolio diet ― or any predominantly whole food, plant-based diet ― the more benefit you can expect to get in terms of lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as lowering risk of cancer and certain metabolic diseases as well,” Hull said.",US,Want To Lower Your Heart Disease Risk?

The year’s end is approaching and, yet again, I am knee deep in planning a meal that can feed 12 people, finding the right candles that represent my personal brand — whatever that may be — and calculating how many bottles of wine to pick up from Costco without fighting anyone in line.  Similarly to the moments after I gave birth to my first daughter, every year after my annual Christmas party, I whisper to myself, “never again.” And just like that, you have another child, and another holiday party. I adore hosting, but at the end of December, I swear up and down that I’ll never host again, never drink again, and that next year is my time to get those abs I know are hidden somewhere.  Advertisement  I think it is safe to say my closest group of friends enjoys (nay, expects) this annual party. I refuse to disappoint people I love dearly, so I’m elated to host over and over again.  But my guests don’t get off that easy. I expect a few things from my nearest and dearest in regards to a dinner party. Nothing should elicit anyone to clutch their pearls, but if so, hold on tight.  Advertisement  Being fashionably late is applauded.  Promptness is, yes, very important in life. Time is precious, and if someone is wasting that preciousness, that is — to me — punishable by many, many eyerolls and heavy sighs. But in the case of my Christmas party, I’m applauding a 5-to-10-minute delay.  Advertisement  If the invitation states the party begins at 7 p.m., showing up on the dot can be stressful if I’m still basting a turkey or slicing vegetables for a salad (read: reheating chicken cacciatore I bought from a local catering company) so, take a beat between parking your car or getting out of your Uber. Tie your shoe in slow-motion, if need be. A slight delay means your host has a little wiggle room.  Etiquette expert Mariah Grumet, the founder and instructor of Old Soul Etiquette, says using a 10-minute delay is the acceptable thing to do. “For a social event such as a Christmas party, the proper etiquette is to aim to arrive on time or within 10-15 minutes of the invitation time. It would be considered poor etiquette to arrive at someone’s social event early, as you’d want to give your host every last second to put their finishing touches on their event. Beyond 15 minutes would simply be considered late, which is definitely rude to your host! There is a sweet spot, and for your 7 p.m. party, that is 7-7:15 p.m., not 6:59 p.m.”  If you offer to bring something, be specific.  Depending on the level of your party (potluck, family style, fully catered) you might have people ask, “Can I bring anything?” This is a lovely notion, but a conflicting one. While I’d love not to make dessert or put together a salad on top of everything else that needs to be done, I’m not necessarily going to dole out roles for my friends, either. Instead, I’d love someone to just claim a dish. “I make a mean charcuterie board, can I bring that?” would actually alleviate a lot of my stress and financial burden of hosting.  Advertisement  Transferring a piping-hot lasagna might not be in the cards, but a lot of dishes can easily be prepared ahead or, at the very least, out of the host’s way — even if that means cutting cucumbers in a laundry room.  Bring something you’d want to drink, in case the well runs dry.  In conjunction with offering to bring something, if you know other people are drinking alcoholic beverages, you can bring an option to be shared among the guests. Something bottled is the obvious choice: wine, beer or champagne.  Hosting can add up quickly and alcohol is a fairly big factor in that. Contributing to the communal pile is always appreciated. And, if it’s not touched or open, snag it back if you wish!  Advertisement  Olga Pankova via Getty Images Be ready for the hosts to crack open the bottle you gave them at the dinner party; but not everyone will.  While I believe this is absolutely appropriate in a smaller setting and with close friends, etiquette aficionado Mariah Grumet does not: “As a guest, it is absolutely appropriate to ask your host what you can bring when you respond to their invitation. If they ask you to bring something to drink to share, or bring something you enjoy drinking (alcohol or not), by all means, bring it! If no one drinks it, I would advise leaving it as a bonus for your host.  “However, if your host insists that you do not bring anything, you want to respect their wishes. There’s a good chance they planned out their menu and you don’t want to spring something on them that they were not expecting. In this case, it’s best to bring a gift they can open at a later time, such as a festive set of cocktail napkins.”  Advertisement  If you don’t know someone well, please engage.  An under-appreciated stressor in the art of hosting is the omnipresent question, will everyone get along? As a guest who doesn’t know many people, entering a house full of friends sends you right back to the elementary school playground. So let’s put this in writing.  Guests, won’t you please engage in interesting and meaningful conversation with each other?! Inclusion seems to be taught to children and teenagers (or attempted, at the very least), but what about in adulthood? Sit down next to someone you don’t know and engage! Be it the year(s) of COVID isolation, the comfort in the known or laziness, it seems people have stopped engaging in new interactions.  Hanna Ray Flores and Lea Raymond are the duo behind Hauste, a website dedicated to helping you host the best party. They have some enlightening insight into how to make guests feel comfortable during an intimate dinner party. First, “always offer your guest a beverage upon entering. A drink in hand can break the ice and spark comfort,” they said. Always have a few good dinner party questions in your back pocket: “If conversation is falling flat, don’t hesitate to pull out your go-to dinner party questions like, ‘What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?’ or ‘What is your dream dinner party guest list, dead or alive?’ While it may seem silly to have such ice breaker questions, they usually snowball into conversation that isn’t as easy to catch in a bottle.”  Advertisement  I actually don’t want your help cleaning.",US,5 Things I Expect From My Guests When I Host A Party,,,,0.054,0.708,0.238,0.9998

During his new Netflix stand-up special, which premiered on the streaming service on Tuesday, the actor and comedian said that he suffered a brain bleed and stroke.  Advertisement  Foxx said that on April 11, 2023, he experienced a “bad headache,” and asked his friend for an aspirin, but “went out” before he could take it. He said he can’t remember the next 20 days.  The Oscar winner, who was in Atlanta when his health scare occurred, explained that the first doctor who saw him gave him a cortisone shot and sent him home. But Foxx’s sister later took him to another hospital after he appeared “lethargic.”  Advertisement  He said that a doctor at the second hospital told his sister that he was “having a brain bleed that led to a stroke,” and that the doctor told her: “If I don’t go in his head right now, we’re going to lose him.”  Foxx said that doctors were able to confirm he was having a stroke after a procedure, but that they weren’t able to determine where the bleeding in his brain was coming from.  The actor said doctors told his sister at the time that he “may be able to make a full recovery,” but that it was going to be “the worst year” of his life.  Foxx woke up on May 4, 2023. “I found myself in a wheelchair,” he said. “I couldn’t walk.”  Foxx’s daughter Corinne Foxx announced in a statement in April last year that her father was recovering after suffering a “medical complication,” though she didn’t divulge further details about the actor’s health condition. The actor and his family have since publicly shared updates about his recovery.

We’re gonna get back to the stand-up sort of roots,” he said at the time.  Kevin Winter via Getty Images Brain bleeds like Jamie Foxx's often show some important warning signs.  Advertisement  What is a brain bleed?  A brain bleed, or intracranial hemorrhage, is a type of stroke, the brain equivalent of a heart attack. Brain bleeds are a life-threatening medical emergency that causes blood to pool between the brain and skull, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  There are two main areas where brain bleeds can occur, per the clinic’s website: within your skull, but outside of the brain tissue; or inside the brain tissue. They’re caused by “leaky, broken or burst” blood vessels.  This can happen due to several causes, such as head trauma, a blood clot, a brain tumor or a weak spot in a blood vessel wall, among other reasons.  Advertisement  What are the symptoms of a brain bleed?  The symptoms of a brain bleed include a sudden, painful headache that doesn’t go away and gets worse, as well as vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, pupils that are different sizes and paralysis, according to the Mayo Clinic.  How is a brain bleed diagnosed?  Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans and angiograms, are the best ways to determine the size and position of the bleeding.  Treatment for brain bleeds may include medication or surgery. Some brain hemorrhages may not require surgery, depending on the size, cause and location of the hemorrhage, as well as your general health.  Advertisement  The Cleveland Clinic states that you may need rehabilitation after a brain bleed to “help you regain the functions needed for daily living and prevent future brain bleeds.”",US,Jamie Foxx Reveals Life-Threatening Condition That Led To His Hospitalization,,,,0.1,0.841,0.059,-0.9853
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-shapewear-bad-for-your-health_l_67575aefe4b0878021580cb4,Huffington Post,neutral,International,,"Cat Gwynn via Getty Images  Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Sarah Hyland have admitted to wearing more than one pair of Spanx shapewear at a time to achieve their ideal shape. Similarly, stars and influencers like Kylie Jenner, Jessica Alba, Nicki Minaj and Coco Austin have promoted waist trainers to get an hourglass figure. Beauty may be pain, but at what cost?  HuffPost spoke to six experts, including doctors and physical therapists, about the good and bad of shapewear and corsetry.  Advertisement  How bad is shapewear for your body?  The most common reason people wear shapewear and corsets is to change their body’s shape and smooth out their appearance. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to look your best, but overdoing it can have serious consequences.  “Shapewear isn’t inherently good or bad — it all depends on how you wear it,” said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a chief medical adviser for Garage Gym Reviews.  Advertisement  Bhasha Mukherjee, a general practitioner and medical correspondent in the U.K., said, “I’ll refer to the old saying: The dose decides the poison. It depends on how many hours you’re wearing it, what kind of waist trainer/corset/shapewear you’re wearing, and how tight it is.”  “At the very least, wearing shapewear daily can result in discomfort, but it could also exacerbate anxiety, poor ventilation in the lungs or even musculoskeletal conditions,” said Dr. Michael Masi, a sports doctor and certified personal trainer. “Any body region where movement is repeatedly restricted over prolonged periods is subject to tissue deprivation, where muscles and tendons become weaker and less resistant to stress.”  “Although the use of shapewear might have specific benefits in certain situations, I never recommend them for day-to-day use,” said Darcie Pervier, a women’s health specialist, physical therapist and owner of Newburyport Wellness.    Let’s see all the different bodily functions they can affect.  Breathing/Lungs  “If [shapewear] is too tight and restricting your diaphragm, it can create difficulty breathing, restrict deep breathing and cause shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness,” said Dr. Laura Purdy, a board-certified family medicine physician.    “You don’t often allow enough space for your lungs to expand when taking a deep breath, so you might end up not taking in enough oxygen,” Mukherjee said. You also might struggle to expel all the air from your lungs, leading to a fainting episode (either from too little oxygen or too much carbon dioxide), she explained.  Advertisement  Stomach  “When shapewear puts pressure on your stomach area, it can cause digestive issues like acid reflux and heartburn because of the acid traveling up the esophagus,” said Purdy. It can also detract from the normal rhythm of organ movement, which can “disrupt how well the diaphragm, liver and gut move and shift.”  Bloomberg via Getty Images Kim Kardashian's Skims has upended the underwear industry, surging to almost $1 billion in net sales in 2023.  Compression garments can also cause a hiatal hernial, ”where part of your stomach is forced up and can protrude through a hole (hiatus) in the chest,” said Amy Cooke, a women’s exercise specialist.  Advertisement  Masi has noticed gut issues come up for a lot of his clients when they wear tight-fitting garments for a prolonged time. “The organs are designed to move and expand to accommodate, propel and mechanically digest food. If restricted, people may experience abdominal pain and digestive issues and may cause or exacerbate conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well,” he said.  Pelvic Floor  With shapewear, Mukherjee said, “essentially, you’re putting more and more pressure on the pelvic floor, which then pushes on the pelvic organs. You can sometimes have difficulty controlling your bladder.”  “Pressure from shapewear can cause the bladder, bowel, uterus and rectum to move lower down, increasing the risk of them prolapsing (bulging) into the vagina,” Cooke said.  Advertisement  “I have seen more than one client managing early-stage uterine prolapse use shapewear without realizing it could negatively impact their symptoms. Sadly, this can cause a mild prolapse to become significantly worse,” warned Cooke.  Skin  Depending on how tight the garment is and how long you wear it, you may experience irritation. “It can cause pressure sores on your skin from the pressure of the garment, which can result in skin irritation,” Mukherjee said.  Nerves  “Some people notice that their muscles feel weaker or sore if they wear shapewear all the time, as it keeps your body from moving naturally,” Dasgupta said.  Advertisement  Shapewear can even cause you to go numb: “If shapewear is too tight and is digging into your skin, it can cause numbness from the pressure on the nerve,” Purdy said.  “As a physical therapist, I sometimes see people with symptoms related to peripheral nerve compression, such as tingling or numbness in the thighs — a condition known as meralgia paresthetica. This results from the compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve [a nerve of the thigh],” Masi said.  Are there any positives that shapewear and corsets offer?  It depends. “Worn occasionally, shapewear can smooth out lines under clothes and offer some light support to your back, which might help you stand up straighter,” Dasgupta said.  Advertisement  Mukherjee noted that shapewear and corsetry may be helpful after any abdominal surgery, including pregnancy. “Your abdominal muscles can become weaker, you can get tears in the fibers in between, and that’s why some women after pregnancy have a physiological hernia. Essentially, the wall of the abdomen isn’t very strong, and your inner organs can poke through. Using a waist trainer can prevent hernias and give extra support to those muscles,” she said.  “Some say it helps with posture by activating and supporting your back,” Purdy said, but noted that shapewear may also weaken the back and abs with extended use.  Mukherjee agreed — ribbed corsets force you to sit upright, which can help you avoid slouching. However, a permanent posture change it’s likely related to habit formation rather than the corset itself, she added.  Advertisement  “Shapewear can also give extra support than might be lacking in the abdominal core muscles,” Mukherjee said, and recommended breathable fabrics, like compression garments, that aren’t too tight and can also help with inflammation of scars or burns.  Exercise and waist trainers  How about those waist trainers that you can wear in the gym to sweat more and shape your waist? Thanks to their shape, waist trainers (which should not be confused with weight-lifting trainer belts used to support your back when weight lifting) are essentially corsets.  The experts agreed that wearing waist trainers or other restrictive clothing while exercising should be avoided for various reasons, including sabotaging your workout.  Advertisement  “Physical activity requires a full range of motion, adequate breathing capacity, and proper core engagement. Restricting the diaphragm can lead to shallow breathing and reduced oxygen intake. The added external support of a corset may reduce the intrinsic support from your core, leading to less engagement and less effective exercise,” Masi said.  Plus, wearing something restrictive while working out will make sweat linger on the skin and may also cause skin barrier irritation or fungal growth, Mukherjee noted.  No type of waist trainer helps with weight loss or fat burn. “The garment doesn’t reduce body fat, increase muscle tone or permanently reshape tissues,” Masi said. “Compression garments are not a substitute for exercise, as they don’t effectively engage the core or other muscles in a way that would lead to long-term body shaping.”  Advertisement  How often should one wear shapewear?  “It is important to recognize that wearing shapewear for a night out is just fine as long as you have no other medical issues,” Pervier said.  If you have to wear shapewear or corsets occasionally, you must pick the right size and ensure they aren’t too tight. It shouldn’t be too restrictive, as that’s when issues arise. “The key is wearing shapewear in moderation and in a size that fits you,” Purdy added.

Many a skin-care-loving, jet-setting traveler has their TSA 3-1-1 game locked down and prepared to face the hectic holiday travel season. Each of their 3.4-ounce liquid, gel and aerosol skin care products is carefully packed in a clear 1-quart zip-top bag and ready for their carry-on bag.  However, with newer skin care products on the market like balms, jellies and sticks, it can be confusing to tell whether or not these products fall under the TSA 3-1-1 liquid rule for checked luggage. Your favorite cleansing balm can hold its shape, so would that mean it’s considered a solid? But cleansing balms can also be spread, so would it be considered a liquid?  Advertisement  And what about other items like sheet masks or powdered forms of skin care? If you have to wait hours to board your delayed flight, can you at least create a little slice of tranquility among the holiday travel chaos with a sheet mask? Or are some of these products at risk of being thrown into the trash at security?  To find out which products are allowed in your carry-on luggage and which you should pack in your checked luggage for holiday travels, HuffPost spoke to Eri Jenkins, a 17-year veteran of the Transportation Security Administration and Uniformed Advisor for TSA Security Operations.  Advertisement  The 411 on TSA’s 3-1-1  If you plan on packing your skin care lotions and potions in your carry-on luggage for your holiday flights, ensure they meet the TSA 3-1-1 rule, with each product packed in a travel-sized container of 3.4 ounces (100 ml) or less. Your products should then fit inside a single 1-quart bag.  Advertisement  While the rules around the carry-on status of your favorite liquid serums and gel night creams are relatively straightforward, some other products might leave travelers scratching their heads as to whether or not the 3-1-1 rule applies.  Cleansing Balms and Jellies  As a good rule of thumb, Jenkins recommends that if you can spread, rub or spray the skin care item, it should adhere to the TSA 3-1-1 rule if you want to pack it into your carry-on luggage.  So if you plan on wowing your family and friends with your favorite cleansing balm at the next big holiday gathering, ensure the container is either under 3.4 ounces or pack it in your checked luggage.  Advertisement  Powdered Skin Care  Powdered forms of skin care are another relatively new addition to the market. Skin care fanatics can find everything from cleansers to serums to even sunscreens in powdered form.  If you like your skin care like you like your donuts (powdered), you’re in luck! The TSA allows travelers to bring up to 12 ounces of powder-like substances in their carry-on luggage. Anything larger might require extra screening.  Jenkins notes that powdered forms of skin care should remain in their pre-mixed, powdered form to comply with the 12-ounce limit for powder-like substances.  Advertisement  Sheet Masks  In case you need a little extra pampering in the boarding area while your flight has been delayed for the third time, according to Jenkins, individually packaged sheet masks are (fortunately) allowed in carry-on luggage.  Baby and makeup wipes also receive the OK from TSA for your carry-on luggage.  Don’t Make These Carry-On Skin Care Mistakes  Opened or unopened, ALL containers must be 3.4 ounces or less.  If you frequently travel through international airports, you may have seen a fellow traveler waltz through security with full-sized skin care products purchased from duty-free.  While these sealed and unopened liquids (skin care and otherwise) from duty-free are allowed through TSA checkpoints under special conditions, don’t assume you can bring your full-sized products from home through the security checkpoint simply because they are unopened.  Advertisement  “The biggest misconception I see with passengers coming through the checkpoint is that an item can be any size as long as it’s not opened, and that’s not true,” Jenkins said. “So even if you have a 12-ounce bottle of lotion that’s still closed and has the manufacturer seal on it, it still will not be able to come through your carry-on bag.”  The TSA goes by container size, not the amount in the container.  Jenkins says another mistake she sees is passengers using a container that is larger than 3.4 ounces to store their skin care products, even when the contents are less than 3.4 ounces. If you pack your skin care in a larger container, you might run the risk of the item not making it past the TSA security checkpoint.  “We go by container size,” Jenkins said.  Even if you only have one ounce of the viral (and very pricey) SK-II essence left in the 11-ounce packaging you snagged from Costco, play it safe and either pack it in your checked luggage or leave it at home for you to enjoy when you return after the holidays.  Advertisement  Give yourself plenty of extra time at the airport.  In the recent past, it was the norm to arrive at the airport two hours before your flight’s departure. But nowadays, you may need to arrive even earlier— particularly during the busy holiday travel season.  Carter Langston, the press secretary for the TSA, cautions that travelers may need to plan to get to the airport even earlier, particularly if they need to return rental vehicles or check baggage during airport “rush hours.”  “Rush hours tend to be early in the morning between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. and in the afternoon between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.,” Langston said.  Advertisement  While arriving early to the airport will allow you to rest a little easier during your holiday travels, Jenkins says budging this extra time will also make the security checkpoint process easier for yourself and TSA officers.  “Travelers should also remember that anytime that they’re coming through the checkpoint, anything that will be in your accessible property could be subjected to additional screening,” Jenkins said.  Just in case a TSA officer needs to make an additional screening at the security checkpoint, Jenkins recommends making everything easier for both yourself and the officer by removing your 1-quart bag of products from your carry-on luggage before sending it through the X-ray machine.  Advertisement  “If [the skin care product] does have to go through additional screening, by it being outside of the bag, it’s easier for the officer to locate it,” Jenkins said.

If you’re an avid traveler, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your passport fill up with stamps, turning that once-blank travel document into a nostalgic little memory book.  But as delightful as it is to have a paper trail of evidence of your past adventures, your large stamp collection could lead to issues on future trips if you don’t pay close attention. That’s all due to a passport validity rule that many people overlook.  Advertisement  “One rule many travelers miss is needing an adequate number of blank pages in their passport for visas, and entry and exit stamps,” David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com, told HuffPost. “This is often forgotten, especially by those with passports close to expiring or having only a few blank pages.”  The U.S. State Department did not set the blank pages rule, which stems from other countries’ requirements for international visitors.  “Some countries require passports to have at least two to four blank visa or stamp pages, and thus, some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met,” said Caroline Tanner, a trends writer at The Points Guy.  Advertisement  Just as travelers often need to have at least three to six months of passport validity beyond the dates of an international trip, they may also need to have a certain number of empty pages depending on the requirements at their destination.  “The basis for this rule is maintaining proper security measures and part of the entry and exit requirements,” Alwadish said. “Not meeting this requirement can cause problems at borders. If the traveler does not have the required blank pages in the passport, the passport will technically be invalid and the person may not be allowed to board the plane.”  He emphasized that airlines can bar passengers who do not meet the requirement from boarding their flights to avoid complications at the international destination.  Advertisement  “If for whatever reason it is overlooked in the U.S., the traveler may take a big risk once they arrive at their destination country, as every border patrol officer has the right to determine the outcome,” Alwadish explained. “They may have travelers detained, pay a fine or let them pass.”  Taking that kind of risk in a foreign country is not advisable, he added. And there’s a long list of countries that have this rule in place. Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Germany, India, Belgium, South Africa, the Netherlands, Cuba, Iceland, Zimbabwe and Indonesia are among the destinations that require two blank pages. Countries that require one page include France, Japan, Mexico, Greece, Thailand, Australia, Morocco, Argentina and Vietnam, among others. But you’ll need at least three blank pages if you want to visit Namibia, Botswana, Madagascar and Zambia.  “While some pages may be full of stamps, others might have one ― and just one stamp means that that page is not empty,” Alwadish cautioned.  Advertisement  Immigration authorities in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have also emphasized that the “endorsement” pages found at the back of many passports are different from visa pages and thus do not count as blank pages for the purposes of entry and exit stamps. (Newer passports have the endorsement section closer to the front.)  Meanwhile, Armenia and Micronesia have no stated blank passport page requirements.  “Countries like Sweden and the Philippines don’t require a blank page on your passport, but rather sufficient space for entry and exit stamps,” Alwadish noted.  He recommended looking at the State Department’s website for a breakdown of the specific entry prerequisites for each country.  Advertisement  Jake Wyman via Getty Images Many avid travelers delight in their extensive collections of passport stamps, but it's important to check the blank page requirements before visiting an international destination.  Keep in mind that blank page rules don’t just apply to U.S. visitors, either.  “This is true for all incoming travelers to the country, regardless of nationality, based on requirements set by individual countries for incoming visitors,” Tanner said.  Over time, frequent travelers may not need to worry as much about having enough empty passport pages.  Advertisement  “The issue of blank passport pages will likely become less of a significant problem for travelers as more countries are phasing out manual stamping of physical passport books,” Alwadish said. “The European Union is spearheading this shift with the introduction of the Entry/Exit System, intended to expedite the border control process and improve data accuracy.”  He explained that this new system uses biometric technology to scan travelers’ fingerprints and faces at border checkpoints.  “This data will then be stored and used to verify their arrival and exits, cross referenced with their passport information, removing the necessity for physical passport stamps,” he said.  Advertisement  But for now, immigration officers still need to ensure there are enough pages for stamps and visas. So travelers must remain vigilant.  “It is always best to make sure your passport is valid and has at least two blank pages,” Alwadish noted. “If a traveler does not have enough blank pages available, they cannot add more to their physical book.”  As of 2016, the U.S. government does not allow travelers to add extra pages to their existing passports. If they need more pages, they must renew their passports.  Advertisement  People who often travel internationally might want to consider choosing the option for a bigger passport with more visa pages. It’s no extra cost, and all you have to do is check the box that says “large book” when you fill out the form.  If you have an impending trip abroad, there are ways to get a new passport in a rush on your own or by paying a third party for expedited service. And of course, the best way to avoid adding extra stress and hassle is to keep track of your passport and ensure it’s compliant throughout the year.",US,The 1 Big Mistake You Should Avoid With Your Passport,,,,0.049,0.874,0.077,0.9863
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/queef-vagina-fart-flatulence-sex-ano_l_675ca50fe4b08821cba78ed8,Huffington Post,neutral,Business,,"Cavan Images via Getty Images Flatulence from your vagina during sex or physical activities like yoga is common and nothing to be ashamed of.  Queefing, as anyone with a vagina will tell you, can happen at some inopportune times: while you’re having sex, in the middle of a yoga class or during a visit to the gynecologist.  You may have heard some people refer to queefs as “vaginal farts” (charming). But while queefs do produce a toot-like sound, we can assure you that queefing is not the same as passing gas.  Advertisement  We talked to gynecologists and sex therapists to learn more about what causes queefs, some of the misconceptions about them and why they shouldn’t be as mortifying as we make them out to be.  What makes you queef, anyway?  Queefing is an involuntary bodily function that occurs when air is pushed into the vagina, gets temporarily trapped in the folds of the vaginal canal (called rugae) and is then released.  Advertisement  “Queefing happens when a penis, fingers or sex toy go in and out of the vagina bringing additional air along with it,” Sherry A. Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, California and the author of “She-ology: The Definitive Guide to Women’s Intimate Health,” told HuffPost. “Sex can involve a lot of thrusting of the penis in and out of the vagina, typically pushing extra air into a dead-end space.”  Certain sex positions, like doggy style where your pelvis is titled upwards, or abruptly switching from one position to another, may increase the likelihood of queefing. Even non-sexual activities, like putting in a tampon or menstrual cup, practicing yoga (like when you move out of an inversion pose) or your gyno inserting a speculum can lead to queefing.  “From my experience as an OB-GYN, almost every woman has experienced at least one episode of queefing some time during her life, sometimes even during a pelvic exam,” said Diana Hoppe, an OB-GYN in Encinitas, California.  While the gas that comes out of your rectum may have a foul odor (a result of bacterial activity in the gut), queefs are odorless, Hoppe added.  Advertisement  Can you prevent a queef?  And as OB-GYN Sheila Loanzon told Cosmopolitan, “If you try to contract the vaginal canal to prevent air from coming in, it can cause sex to be more painful.”  Advertisement  “Also, when doing any abdominal exercises or weight-bearing exercise, it is important to squeeze the pelvic floor while holding the core abdominal muscles tight,” Hoppe said. “Many women squeeze abdominal muscles but do not activate the pelvic floor at the same time, thus allowing the pelvic floor to sag, increasing the likelihood of air entering into vaginal canal.”  During sex, keeping the penis, fingers or sex toy inside you while you change positions could lessen your chances of queefing because it “gives air less of an opportunity to get into the vagina,” Jamil Abdur-Rahman, an OB-GYN and the chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vista Health System in Waukegan, Illinois, told Self.  Advertisement  And in theory, you could just avoid certain sex or yoga positions altogether. But what’s the fun in that?  When queefing does happen, don’t sweat it.  So why does this very normal bodily function feel so embarrassing in the moment, be it during doggy-style or downward dog? It really just comes down to that pesky noise, Hoppe said.  “The stigma is due to lack of understanding the difference between release of air from the vagina and flatulence,” she said. “The sound effects may be the same though, so culturally there may be a stigma or embarrassment due to this occurring ‘down there.’”  Advertisement  Sex therapist Vanessa Marin underscored the fact that queefing is normal, common and “not anything to be ashamed of.” Embracing the awkwardness of the moment can even make sex more enjoyable for both partners.  “Our bodies make funny noises sometimes, and that’s OK!” she said. “Plus, there are plenty of other goofy things about sex, like getting sweaty, slipping out, getting into awkward positions and so on. The more we can laugh about these kinds of things, the more fun we’ll have during sex.”  When a queef slips out mid-coitus, you have two choices: ignore that deflating balloon sound completely or quickly acknowledge it and move on. Marin prefers the latter route.  Advertisement  “It’s a personal preference, but I think it’s better to just quickly acknowledge it and laugh it off,” she said. “That way you don’t have to sit there thinking about it, anxiously wondering whether or not your partner heard it.”  Is queefing ever cause for concern?  Generally, queefing is nothing to be worried about. While rare, if queefing is accompanied by pain or a bad smell, you should make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any more serious issues.  “If queefing is associated with a foul odor, it may be an indication of a vaginal infection or possible fistula, an [abnormal] connection between rectum and vagina due to previous radiation treatment or surgery that causes stool or feces to come out of the vagina,” Hoppe said.  Advertisement  But for the most part, queefing is a normal, if slightly awkward, fact of life. So let’s not get so hung up on it, OK?",US,"Here’s Why You Queef During Sex.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.

(Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.

When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness.

I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!

All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

Left: Amazon MGM Studios; Right: Roadside Attractions  Unless folks are doing something like recording whole scenes of a movie on their cellphones, you generally don’t notice who else is in the audience with you at a movie theater. The lights fade to black, the screen brightens and everything — and everyone — around you virtually disappears. But sometimes taking stock of how others react to a film can tell you a lot about who becomes the arbiters of merit and why.  That’s especially true when you’re watching a Black movie.  An example that comes to mind is “12 Years a Slave,” which tells the harrowing true story of a free Black man who was abducted and sold into slavery in 1841. At a 2013 press screening for the film in Manhattan, an inclusive audience sat transfixed in front of the screen during multiple scenes of sexual and physical violence.  Advertisement  Perusing the theater during those moments revealed something interesting. Some Black viewers were stone-faced, while others seemed exhausted by the second or third brutality scene. Many of the white folks, though, were inconsolable — sobbing and blowing their noses. Perhaps that was on account of white guilt, a performative impulse, or because the film really is that stirring.  In any case, “12 Years a Slave,” a Steve McQueen-directed movie that unflinchingly portrays the horrors of white supremacy, was heralded by a predominantly white and so-called liberal Hollywood elite. And it went on to earn nine Oscar nominations.  There was another staggering Black drama released that same year that was also a nonfiction story dealing with systemic racism, though in a more modern context: “Fruitvale Station.” It earned exactly zero nominations from that same voting branch.  Advertisement  While the Ryan Coogler-directed film can hardly be accused of not engaging with the issue of whiteness through the lens of police brutality, there is a crucial difference between it and the aforementioned offering. It does not hinge on the racially motivated atrocity against its lead character or its perpetrator. Rather, it centers the Black human life that was cut short. It examines who the person was outside of the system of whiteness.  Ethan Herisse (left) and Brandon Wilson in ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  In essence, it’s not a film that necessarily brings white audiences into its story. It actually seems indifferent to whatever reaction they might have. A Hollywood voting establishment that, in spite of all its lip service, has always had an issue appreciating art that does not revolve around their lives or even their ills could see that as a detriment.  Advertisement  They often look for art they can laud that can at least give the appearance that they’re progressive despite showing all signs of the opposite. It’s a self-gratifying tactic that doesn’t serve the art at all, no matter how good it is.  It’s been over a decade since “12 Years a Slave” and “Fruitvale Station” were released, and white people’s proximity to a Black narrative still weighs heavily on their acclaim for it. This year’s “Nickel Boys” and “Exhibiting Forgiveness” are two other Black films that have had parallel journeys to the big screen and awards season. But their trajectories could not be more different — and for the same reason as their predecessors.  Similar to “12 Years a Slave,” “Nickel Boys,” an adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, is an unrelenting drama following the lives of two young Black men trying to survive an abusive and racist reform school in the 1960s. The performances are good. The movie’s technical merit, including its marvelous cinematography, has already helped it earn the attention of several awards bodies.  Advertisement  Despite it not even being released in limited theaters until Friday, there’s hardly a day that goes by in the last few months — since its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival this summer — that there isn’t press or hype about it. That includes numerous press screenings and initiatives.  But with the effects of systemic oppression being an impeding factor of the story, leaving little space to explore the characters’ humanity, it’s hard not to again wonder whether its appeal to arbitrated audiences is also that it is more for them to appreciate than others who might identify with their experiences.  André Holland (left) and Andra Day in ""Exhibiting Forgiveness."" Courtesy of Roadside Attractions  Advertisement  Director RaMell Ross said he didn’t intend for that to be the case, though. When the filmmaker was asked in an interview with Vanity Fair what his expectations are of audiences that are “older, very white and wealthier,” he replied that “Nickel Boys” “emerges from our centrality, and it ostensibly is for us, but I’m happy to give it to others.”  “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” on the other hand, doesn’t provoke that same question. It almost entirely wrestles with the complexities of its Black characters, and in ways Black audiences especially recognize. Systemic prejudices are understood as the reality in which they live, only because they are Black and it’s set in the present day, not because the plot informs that. There’s nary a moment when the film even gestures toward that to tell its story.  That helps create an intensely insulated film that centers a Black family whose drama is also deeply felt and astoundingly performed. The conflicts, joy and contradictions that propel the plot are of their own making — and not the result of a racially motivated antagonist. White people, come to think of it, are merely ornamental in the story.  Advertisement  It is unequivocally a film by and for Black people to grapple with among ourselves — one that has similarly affected Black audiences in the way “12 Years a Slave” moved white viewers. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” allows white audiences to enter its narrative incidentally only, while films like “Nickel Boys” and “12 Years a Slave” often engage directly with their white audiences through their own historical (and present-day) examination.  It’s a distinction that often results in the latter films being considered worthy of Hollywood’s highest honors.  Taking a look at the theatrical and post-theatrical odysseys of “Exhibiting Forgiveness” and “Nickel Boys” might help bring this into further focus. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is an original story that was amazingly green-lit in our sequel- and adaptation-obsessed culture and based on the personal experiences of writer-director Titus Kaphar, a first-time feature filmmaker.  Advertisement  “Nickel Boys” came with all the fanfare of a known author, an acclaimed literary honor under its belt and at least the assumption that its Jim Crow-era setting means that whiteness could obviously play a significant role in the story. Even Ross’ avant-garde filmmaking that shifts the camera and perspective between the two lead characters couldn’t deter an audience that was already locked in.  Herisse stars as Elwood in a moment from ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  Ross also told Vanity Fair that the process between the film being green-lit and going into production through Orion Pictures and Amazon MGM Studios was fairly smooth, to his own surprise. And since its Telluride premiere just a few months ago, “Nickel Boys” has experienced a constant whirlwind of praise from various awards bodies and audiences.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, Kaphar told me during an interview that “it was a fight” to get “Exhibiting Forgiveness” released in theaters. Like many filmmakers, especially Black filmmakers whose work is too often considered niche, Kaphar was approached about bringing the film to a streaming service.  Despite earning rave reviews following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it went months without being acquired, and then months later — not until October — it was released by Roadside Attractions. By then, many people had forgotten about it or just hadn’t heard much about it at all.  Save from a video-on-demand release and awards screeners available to voting press, the film hasn’t been able to achieve any major award nominations and hasn’t popped up on most “best of 2024” lists. (It made HuffPost’s roundup.) Unlike “Fruitvale Station,” it also failed to earn an Independent Spirit Award nomination or other award precursor nominations.  Advertisement  None of this discussion is to elevate any one Black film above another, suggest that a certain kind of Black film is better than the next, or even pit two films against each other. Both can and should be in the conversation.

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads.

(South Korean Presidential Office/Yonhap via AP) via AP  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s parliament on Saturday impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his stunning and short-lived martial law decree, a move that ended days of political paralysis but set up an intense debate over Yoon’s fate, as jubilant crowds roared to celebrate another defiant moment in the country’s resilient democracy.  The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85. Yoon’s presidential powers and duties were subsequently suspended and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s No. 2 official, took over presidential powers later Saturday.  Advertisement  The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he’s thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon’s impeachment after ruling party lawmakers boycotted it last Saturday. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon’s impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon’s impeachment was an outcome driven by “the people’s ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.”  Advertisement  Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, “We have preserved the constitutional order!”  In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached.

Advertisement  Han, who became the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han’s office.  South Korea’s executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade and finance and was the ambassador to the U.S. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.  Advertisement  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred.  Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law.  The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon “committed rebellion that hurts peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.” It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.  Advertisement  Yoon remains defiant  In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon had rejected the rebellion charges, calling his order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it “a monster” and “anti-state forces” that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.  Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a “mad declaration of war” against his own people.  Observers say Yoon’s speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon’s approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.  Advertisement  Some of Yoon’s claims don’t align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.  Most notably, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that after martial law was announced, Yoon called him and asked for his troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he didn’t carry out Yoon’s orders.  Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.  Advertisement  In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers. Roh jumped to his death in 2009, after he had left office, amid a corruption scandal involving his family.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea.  He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested.

He is fighting extradition to New York, where he has been charged with second-degree murder.  HuffPost has reached out to Friedman Agnifilo for comment.  The news comes as officials say they have found new evidence in the case, with New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch stating that a 3D-printed gun Mangione possessed at the time of his Pennsylvania arrest matched three shell casings recovered at the Manhattan shooting scene.  His fingerprints also matched those that investigators found on a water bottle and granola bar wrapper located near the scene, police said.

If the news these days overwhelms you, you’re hardly alone: America is as politically polarized as ever. Almost every day, there’s a new controversial Cabinet pick from President-elect Donald Trump. There are drawn-out wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and here in the U.S., some say we’re on the edge of a looming class war.  In short, we are living in bizarre, capital-letter Unprecedented Times. If you’re able to block it all out and not take on the stress, you’re lucky.  Advertisement  A week after Trump won the election, independent journalist Marisa Kabas wrote on Bluesky about how frenzied the news cycle makes her feel.  “There has to be a better way than sounding an alarm every single time a deranged Trump-related story drops,” she said. “It’s unhealthy and unsustainable. We need to find a way to stay informed without spiking cortisol and without losing sight of the bigger picture. I’m just...not sure how.”  Advertisement  A month later, Kabas says she’s still considering this question.  “When there’s a deluge of really intense news, I know my instinct is often ‘make it stop.’ But since I know the news is never going to stop, I’ve been trying in those moments to think instead of momentarily putting it aside,” said Kabas, who publishes The Handbasket, a newsletter about politics, media and power.  Advertisement  Kabas think people need to remind themselves that just because news is available to them at all times doesn’t mean they’re required to consume it. You can gauge your personal limit and clock out when you need to.  “This isn’t to say ignorance is bliss; at this really scary moment in history, some tolerance for distress is required to avoid being complicit in allowing this country to passively slide all the way into fascism,” she told HuffPost. “But if you’re overwhelmed, choose a few outlets you trust and read them as often as you find tolerable.”  What other steps can you take to manage the emotional impact stressful news has on you?

For me, that often looks like hitting a local trail with my queer chosen family. We hike, talk and hold space for each other as we navigate these challenging times.

Win/win.” ― Kabas  Focus on things that bring you joy, give you perspective and that are in your control.  “I step away from the news and focus in on the things in life that bring me joy (my infant son, my wife, our friends and family, music, running), give me perspective (the woods, the ocean, our long history as a resilient and adaptive trans community), and that I can control (how I show up for myself, my family, and my community, and the contributions I make every day in ways big and small to the collective and enduring effort to create a more peaceful and inclusive world).

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/should-you-open-bottle-of-wine-host-gift_l_6744ac9be4b0b7647d8a1385,Huffington Post,neutral,Business,,"Lorenzo Conti For HuffPost  When visiting a friend’s house for dinner or a party, it’s a common tradition to bring a gift for the host. This might be a bouquet of flowers, a scented candle or even a bottle of wine. But sometimes, a gifted item of food or drink can cause miscommunication between hosts and guests.  For instance, if a host thanks their guest for bringing a bottle of wine, but it never appears on the communal bar or dinner table, does that mean the host isn’t happy with the gift?  Advertisement  What are the rules and guidelines around edible and drinkable gifts, and how can hosts clearly communicate their expectations? To answer these questions, we turned to a group of modern etiquette experts and event professionals.  Serving or not serving gifted items is totally up to the host.  The first thing to remember about bringing a gift to a party is that, once given, the gift becomes the sole property of the host, and what happens to it is up to them.  Advertisement  “Host gifts, whether it is a bottle of wine, a handmade food item or a box of candy, are not expected to be opened and offered at the gathering unless the guest and host have discussed it and agreed to do so,” confirmed Renate Devin, the owner of the Boston School of Etiquette.  Jamila Musayeva, a certified etiquette coach and the author of “The Art of Entertaining at Home,” agreed, adding that “when you bring a bottle of wine, homemade cookies or any edible item as a gift, it’s thoughtful to remember that this is a gesture of appreciation, not an expectation for it to be served immediately. Hosts usually have planned their menu and wine selection, so a well-chosen gift is best viewed as something for them to enjoy later, unless they specifically ask you to contribute to the party offerings. It is up to the host to serve or open what the guest has brought because the host is in charge of planning the menu and deciding how and what to serve — particularly pairing of beverages with food.”  So if your friend doesn’t open the bottle of pinot noir that you brought to dinner, don’t take it personally. They’re likely planning to save it for another time!  The host should communicate whether guests are expected to contribute a dish or drink to the party.  Sit-down dinner events and potluck dinners abide by specific rules, but many house parties fall into a nebulous middle ground. Food will be served and the host is planning to provide the mains, but if a guest wants to contribute a side dish or a dessert (or a bottle of vino), the addition is often encouraged.  Advertisement  As a host, providing clear communication can chase away any doubts or misunderstandings about what a guest should bring, or whether they should bring something at all.  “If a host has thoughts or opinions on what guests should bring, they should communicate the expectation in advance,” suggested Melissa Ben-Ishay, the founder and CEO of the company Baked by Melissa. “Oftentimes, when my own guests ask what they can bring, I give them a category. Bring dessert, or bring an adult beverage — this helps the host weave these things into the serving plan.”  You can even be more specific with your guests about which items would be helpful for the meal, said Christine Schaub, the host of “Come on Over,” a web series that is available on YouTube and focuses on home entertaining. Schaub said that such a conversation might go like this: “A pinot grigio would pair beautifully with the salad course. Would you like to bring a bottle?” Then, if the guest asks “for a suggested vintner, be ready with affordable suggestions,” she added.  Advertisement  And if a guest shows up at your door with a gift but you’re not sure whether it’s intended to be shared at the party, Schaub said that you can pick up on some clues from the presentation. “If a beverage arrives in a gift bag, it is truly a gift — not a shareable,” she advised, noting that the same goes for food items.“It’s entirely up to the host whether to serve or save it for another time. If a beverage arrives hot or chilled (in an insulated tote), that’s your tip that [it was intended to] ... be served.”  It might seem tacky to include details about gifts in an invitation (since you as the host may not want guests to think that you expect a present), but Musayeva said there’s a way to express your preferred policy without seeming like a gift-grubber.  “If you’re hosting and prefer not to incorporate gifts into the event’s refreshments, feel free to mention it in a warm and subtle way ahead of time,” Musayeva suggested. “A quick message like ‘Looking forward to seeing everyone! Your presence is the best gift, but if you do bring something special, I’d love to enjoy it later on my own’ makes it clear without any pressure.”  Advertisement  Guests can also take the initiative to ask whether they should bring something.  Hosts have a lot of elements to juggle when preparing for a dinner or a party, so invitation details can sometimes fall by the wayside. If you receive an invite but still aren’t sure whether to bring a dish or a drink, don’t hesitate to shoot the host a quick text message or email.  “It is recommended to ask the host beforehand if one can contribute in any way to the party and what would be most suitable,” Musayeva pointed out. “Perhaps extra portions of cookies or fruits would be appreciated, or beverages. If that is the case, then it is acceptable to assume the host will serve what you brought.”  If you want to give an edible gift while avoiding ambiguity, stay clear of baked goods and wine.  Since gifts like wine and cookie platters could go either way in a “to serve immediately or not?” debate, you might consider a different option to prevent the host from wondering if your offering is meant to be shared.  Advertisement  Shannon Smith, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based private chef and the author of “The Hidden Table,” said possible food and drink gifts may include “gourmet olive oil or balsamic vinegar, artisan chocolates, or infused sea salts or seasonings.” On a similar note, Ben-Ishay said that she likes to “make homemade vanilla extract a year in advance and use that as a gift to bring [to parties]. It always feels extra special when it’s homemade.”  Musayeva noted that “when choosing a gift for a host, keeping their dietary preferences or alcohol choices in mind shows true thoughtfulness. Always bear in mind the religious/cultural background of the host, as alcoholic beverages and foods containing pork or cow meat might not be acceptable.”  A ‘no takebacks’ or ‘no givebacks’ policy always applies to party gifts.  Say a guest brings a bottle of wine to your dinner party, but you already have beverages mapped out for the night. If you’re tempted to hand the bottle back to your guest as they’re leaving, stop right there.  Advertisement  “It would be rude of the host to even attempt to give it back,” said August Abbott, an etiquette expert with the website JustAnswer. “This is a very, very common mistake.” Keep that bottle for later enjoyment (or regifting), but sending it back with the guest who presented it could be viewed as insulting.",US,Is It Rude If Your Dinner Party Host Didn't Open The Bottle Of Wine You Brought?,,,,0.022,0.793,0.186,0.9997

While it’s true that traveling with little ones will be different than what you’re used to, it’s still possible to indulge your wanderlust and explore new places as a family.  As you may have gathered from your paltry parental leave, the U.S. is not always the most welcoming country for families with children. Many other nations show more consideration for kids and parents in both their public policies and their cultural practices. Not all of these locales feature bathroom changing tables or stroller-friendly streets, but there is often a shared expectation that kids will be integrated into daily life, whether they’re riding public transit, dining out or visiting a national monument.  During one of our early forays abroad as parents, my wife and I took our 1-year-old to the Dominican Republic. We looked pretty ridiculous maneuvering our stroller through the cobblestone streets of old Santo Domingo, but everyone we interacted with was helpful and kind. A waiter in a traditional restaurant even picked up our baby and cheerfully walked around with him for a bit so that we could use both hands to enjoy our food. All our fellow diners got to watch our son return their smiles and bestow on him the standard “Dios le bendiga” (“God bless him”) that Dominicans offer every child who crosses their path.  Advertisement  Marie Holmes The author's son awaits lunch at a comedor in the Dominican Republic.  If you’re itching to roam beyond the U.S. with your kids, here are some recommendations from families with lots of travel experience. Of course, not every part of any country will be suited for kids, but these families were able to find child-friendly spots for making memories.  “The most important thing to remember there is that countries are not monoliths, and some parts of a city may be perfectly safe while others are not,” digital nomad and mom Courtney Orgias told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The Dominican Republic  In addition to a child-friendly culture, the all-inclusive resorts in beachy places like Puerto Plata can simplify life for families traveling with young ones.  “You don’t have to worry about lugging a carseat to multiple places or renting a car. They also typically have toddler pools, kids areas, activities and sometimes childcare. The buffets offer a variety of foods so there’s a good chance you’ll find something the baby/toddler will enjoy. The rooms also typically come with refrigerators for storing the baby’s food and milk,” Stephanie Claytor, founder of the brand Blacktrekking, told HuffPost.  Jamaica  Claytor mentions that similar all-inclusive accommodations, alongside white sand beaches and turquoise Caribbean water, are available in Jamaica.  Advertisement  “We took our son to Negril for his second birthday. Our favorite memory is of him dancing on the beach to reggae music during the all-white party on his birthday. We had no idea he could bust a move. He loved the party and reggae music. We of course were in the back away from the crowded dance floor but were still able to enjoy the DJ,” said Claytor.  She recommends looking for places that offer refrigerators (for breastfeeding parents who need to pump milk), ample shade and outdoor dining — “so that I’m not embarrassed when my son breaks out in loud singing or accidentally throws some food.”  With young children, almost any place can be kid-friendly. “Toddlers and babies are amused by the simplest things such as wood chips and stairways,” Claytor said. So if there’s a destination you’re keen to visit with your little one, you can probably find a way to make it work — just be ready to spend an afternoon collecting rocks instead of devouring your novel in the sun.  Advertisement  “Try to get out of your head any images of long afternoons lounging by the pool sipping cocktails,” said British travel blogger Jenny Lynn. “As a parent traveling with kids you still have to be ‘on,’” she continued. “But traveling provides you with a constantly changing backdrop to take on those daily parent chores, and with new adventures to experience together, daily life becomes all the more rewarding.”  Stephanie Claytor Claytor with her husband and child in Jamaica.  Portugal  “Lisbon can seem intimidating to explore with small kids because of all the hills — nobody wants to carry a toddler or push a stroller up a 30% incline — but we were able to take the bus to most places and found it to be efficient and clean; there were stops everywhere,” said Orgias.  Advertisement  Ample parks and green spaces allowed the kids to get their wiggles out and break up a day of sightseeing, she added.  Mexico  Public transportation also makes Mexico City (Mexico D.F.) more navigable for families, according to Orgias. It “has a great train system we were able to utilize and it’s very walkable, with lots of wonderful neighborhoods that are easy to explore on foot,” she said.  Advertisement  “Worrying about traveling with car seats and hopping in and out of ride shares and taxis is scary for a lot of parents,” she explained, but good public transportation options can allay these concerns.  Costa Rica  If your kids eat rice and beans, they’ll have always something to nosh on with gallo pinto at every meal. Maria De la O of Roam Family Travel told HuffPost that year-round access to fresh fruit also made it easy to keep kids satisfied.  There’s plenty to see, between the jungle and the beach. De la O and her family booked a tour via National Geographic Expeditions with local guides and saw about 20 different animals during their stay.

Canada  “The CN Tower, Centre Island and the many summer festivals in the city all present opportunities for novelty, learning and bonding in Toronto. It’s a city with so much cultural diversity that there’s always something to do, indoor & outdoor,” said Orgias.  Advertisement  For animal lovers, Toronto features a zoo and an aquarium. In warmer months, you can take the ferry to Toronto Island Park and enjoy bike trails, picnic areas and even an amusement park. You can also tour Niagara Falls from Toronto.  On the French-Canadian side, Montreal offers plenty of parks, museums and historical sites to keep the whole family occupied. If you’re looking for European-style flair and cobblestone streets, check out Quebec City a bit further north.  Namibia  “Namibia gets our vote as one of the best places for intrepid family travel,” said Lynn, the U.K. travel blogger quoted above. She recommends forgoing an organized tour and instead renting your own 4x4 with roof tents. “The quality of roads is generally very good and the campsites are seriously fantastic (there’s often a pool),” she added.  Advertisement  In addition to “lunar landscapes” and safari wildlife, Namibia offers “a low malaria risk, good health care, German bakeries in every town, and an amazing climate,” Lynn said.  Morocco  “It’s so close to Europe, yet feels a world away with vibrant medinas, sweeping apricot-colored deserts, and jagged snow capped mountains,” Lynn said.

It was such a surreal experience to be able to gift them with these amazing bucket list activities.”  She described Marrakech as “a fast paced city that allows kids and  adults alike to get wrapped up in the blend of rich cultures.”  Lynn said the country is “very doable” by car.  “Kids will love sandboarding in the Sahara Desert, trekking the Atlas Mountains on a mule, or surfing the waves in Essaouira” — a coastal town Lynn found remarkably stroller-friendly.

Lynn says her kids enjoyed sticky rice, banana pancakes, mango and other tropical fruits.

De la O recommended European destinations in general for travel with a baby. “Pushing a sleeping child in a stroller or walking them in a Baby Bjorn or baby backpack is a perfect way to sightsee, so take advantage of the museums and Gothic churches you won’t be able to enjoy when your child gets a little older.”",US,10 Destinations To Consider For Your Next Family Vacation,,,,0.02,0.82,0.16,0.9998

If you’re a living, breathing human on this planet, chances are that someone, at some point, has urged you to eat your fruits and vegetables. There are good reasons for that: Eating a diet low in fruit and veggies, and high in saturated fats, puts you at risk of developing heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It only makes sense, then, that produce-forward meal plans protect your cardiovascular health. These diets are known to help control risk factors for heart disease like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. (However, medication is necessary sometimes, too.)  Advertisement  The Mediterranean diet is a common heart-healthy approach, but there’s another option that may also be key to lowering your cholesterol and your risk of coronary artery disease: the portfolio diet.  Below, experts share the rundown on this plant-forward meal plan and why it’s worth trying.  What is the portfolio diet?  “The portfolio diet was proposed about 20 years ago, and it has a lot in common with other heart-healthy diets that that you heard of, such as a Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet and a whole food, plant-based diet,” said Dr. Sarah Hull, an associate professor of medicine in cardiology at Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut.  Advertisement  “The name comes from the fact that this diet includes a portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods, so foods that reduce mostly the bad cholesterol in the diet,” noted Kristina Petersen, an associate professor in the department of nutritional sciences at Pennsylvania State University.  The portfolio diet is made up of four different food profiles, Melissa Prest, a clinical nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told HuffPost via email. It encourages the consumption of plant-based protein, plant sterols (a natural compound that helps lower cholesterol levels), soluble fiber and monounsaturated fat.  This means “eating a lot of foods like beans, lentils, soy, nuts and seeds, fruits, vegetables and whole grains as a way to obtain those foods, which basically, again, is very similar to whole food plant-based diet,” Hull said.  Some other heart-healthy diets, like the Mediterranean diet and the DASH eating plan, also include animal products like fish and poultry, and dairy products like yogurt and cheese. But the portfolio diet is vegan — which means if you intend to follow the diet exactly, you’ll need to remove any animal products from your rotation.  Advertisement  The portfolio diet specifically focuses on cholesterol, so it’s a good option if you struggle with that.  According to Petersen, the portfolio diet is not as well-studied as the Mediterranean diet, but the data that is available shows it can significantly benefit your cardiovascular health.  “There have been several studies done where they’ve shown pretty substantial lowering of LDL cholesterol ― so the bad cholesterol that increases risk of heart disease ― with this diet,” Petersen said. “In the original study, the lowering was about 29% in four weeks.”  Advertisement  “And then [researchers] did a subsequent study where they actually compared following this diet with lovastatin, which is a pharmaceutical agent to lower cholesterol, and they actually saw a pretty comparable lowering of LDL,” Petersen said. “So we have quite a bit of evidence that it lowers LDL cholesterol, and this is really what the diet is best known for.”  There are still health rewards even if you just add parts of the portfolio diet to your lifestyle. “Each of the four portfolios can reduce cholesterol levels by 5-10%,” Prest said.  Lowering bad cholesterol is “an important part of preventing and treating cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and stroke,” Hull said.  Advertisement  Research also shows that people who follow the portfolio diet are 14% less likely to develop coronary heart disease and have a stroke, according to the American Heart Association.  There are also other health benefits to the portfolio diet: It’s anti-inflammatory and can help people reach their daily fiber goal (most Americans are fiber deficient), Hull said. Women need between 21 and 25 grams of fiber each day, and men need between 30 and 38 grams daily.  martin-dm via Getty Images Nuts and seeds are a key part of this heart-healthy diet.  Advertisement  Here’s how you can take steps to add the portfolio diet to your lifestyle:  “Thinking about making incremental changes rather than making huge, sweeping changes is one of the most important principles to keep in mind,” Hull said. “So, the first thing is to think about [is], ‘What’s my biggest barrier to incorporating healthy changes?’”  If money is an issue, consider buying frozen fruits and veggies instead of fresh — they’ll last longer and are usually cheaper than the fresh alternative, Hull suggested. Bulk dried legumes, such as beans and lentils, are also more economical, she noted.  If your issue is time, consider meal prepping on the weekends, and look up plant-based, make-ahead recipes. Or if you just don’t know how to prep plant-based meals, consider talking to your doctor or a dietitian.  Advertisement  You can start small by focusing on one meal a day. For example, you could begin by eating oatmeal topped with nuts or seeds for breakfast, Petersen said. Or you could try following the portfolio diet at lunch by making grain bowls with quinoa or brown rice topped with chickpeas, veggies and tofu.  Even just snacking on unsalted nuts, apples and peanut butter, or carrots and hummus is part of this diet, Hull noted.  The portfolio diet still has benefits even if you don’t completely follow it.  Let’s be real: Going from a meat-based diet to a totally vegan meal plan is a big ask. Luckily, you don’t have to go fully vegan to see cardiovascular benefits.  Advertisement  “I think you can still incorporate the key features of the portfolio diet [such as whole grains, nuts, vegetables, beans and fruit] without excluding animal products if you want to include those,” Petersen said. “We have a lot of evidence for viscous fiber, plant sterols, soy and nuts reducing cholesterol levels, so if you just ate more of those foods, you would see cholesterol lowering.”  It’s true that you’ll get the greatest health benefits out of this diet if you follow it to the letter. But even just following it when you can is also good for you.  “The more adherent you can be to a diet like the portfolio diet ― or any predominantly whole food, plant-based diet ― the more benefit you can expect to get in terms of lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as lowering risk of cancer and certain metabolic diseases as well,” Hull said.",US,Want To Lower Your Heart Disease Risk?

The year’s end is approaching and, yet again, I am knee deep in planning a meal that can feed 12 people, finding the right candles that represent my personal brand — whatever that may be — and calculating how many bottles of wine to pick up from Costco without fighting anyone in line.  Similarly to the moments after I gave birth to my first daughter, every year after my annual Christmas party, I whisper to myself, “never again.” And just like that, you have another child, and another holiday party. I adore hosting, but at the end of December, I swear up and down that I’ll never host again, never drink again, and that next year is my time to get those abs I know are hidden somewhere.  Advertisement  I think it is safe to say my closest group of friends enjoys (nay, expects) this annual party. I refuse to disappoint people I love dearly, so I’m elated to host over and over again.  But my guests don’t get off that easy. I expect a few things from my nearest and dearest in regards to a dinner party. Nothing should elicit anyone to clutch their pearls, but if so, hold on tight.  Advertisement  Being fashionably late is applauded.  Promptness is, yes, very important in life. Time is precious, and if someone is wasting that preciousness, that is — to me — punishable by many, many eyerolls and heavy sighs. But in the case of my Christmas party, I’m applauding a 5-to-10-minute delay.  Advertisement  If the invitation states the party begins at 7 p.m., showing up on the dot can be stressful if I’m still basting a turkey or slicing vegetables for a salad (read: reheating chicken cacciatore I bought from a local catering company) so, take a beat between parking your car or getting out of your Uber. Tie your shoe in slow-motion, if need be. A slight delay means your host has a little wiggle room.  Etiquette expert Mariah Grumet, the founder and instructor of Old Soul Etiquette, says using a 10-minute delay is the acceptable thing to do. “For a social event such as a Christmas party, the proper etiquette is to aim to arrive on time or within 10-15 minutes of the invitation time. It would be considered poor etiquette to arrive at someone’s social event early, as you’d want to give your host every last second to put their finishing touches on their event. Beyond 15 minutes would simply be considered late, which is definitely rude to your host! There is a sweet spot, and for your 7 p.m. party, that is 7-7:15 p.m., not 6:59 p.m.”  If you offer to bring something, be specific.  Depending on the level of your party (potluck, family style, fully catered) you might have people ask, “Can I bring anything?” This is a lovely notion, but a conflicting one. While I’d love not to make dessert or put together a salad on top of everything else that needs to be done, I’m not necessarily going to dole out roles for my friends, either. Instead, I’d love someone to just claim a dish. “I make a mean charcuterie board, can I bring that?” would actually alleviate a lot of my stress and financial burden of hosting.  Advertisement  Transferring a piping-hot lasagna might not be in the cards, but a lot of dishes can easily be prepared ahead or, at the very least, out of the host’s way — even if that means cutting cucumbers in a laundry room.  Bring something you’d want to drink, in case the well runs dry.  In conjunction with offering to bring something, if you know other people are drinking alcoholic beverages, you can bring an option to be shared among the guests. Something bottled is the obvious choice: wine, beer or champagne.  Hosting can add up quickly and alcohol is a fairly big factor in that. Contributing to the communal pile is always appreciated. And, if it’s not touched or open, snag it back if you wish!  Advertisement  Olga Pankova via Getty Images Be ready for the hosts to crack open the bottle you gave them at the dinner party; but not everyone will.  While I believe this is absolutely appropriate in a smaller setting and with close friends, etiquette aficionado Mariah Grumet does not: “As a guest, it is absolutely appropriate to ask your host what you can bring when you respond to their invitation. If they ask you to bring something to drink to share, or bring something you enjoy drinking (alcohol or not), by all means, bring it! If no one drinks it, I would advise leaving it as a bonus for your host.  “However, if your host insists that you do not bring anything, you want to respect their wishes. There’s a good chance they planned out their menu and you don’t want to spring something on them that they were not expecting. In this case, it’s best to bring a gift they can open at a later time, such as a festive set of cocktail napkins.”  Advertisement  If you don’t know someone well, please engage.  An under-appreciated stressor in the art of hosting is the omnipresent question, will everyone get along? As a guest who doesn’t know many people, entering a house full of friends sends you right back to the elementary school playground. So let’s put this in writing.  Guests, won’t you please engage in interesting and meaningful conversation with each other?! Inclusion seems to be taught to children and teenagers (or attempted, at the very least), but what about in adulthood? Sit down next to someone you don’t know and engage! Be it the year(s) of COVID isolation, the comfort in the known or laziness, it seems people have stopped engaging in new interactions.  Hanna Ray Flores and Lea Raymond are the duo behind Hauste, a website dedicated to helping you host the best party. They have some enlightening insight into how to make guests feel comfortable during an intimate dinner party. First, “always offer your guest a beverage upon entering. A drink in hand can break the ice and spark comfort,” they said. Always have a few good dinner party questions in your back pocket: “If conversation is falling flat, don’t hesitate to pull out your go-to dinner party questions like, ‘What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?’ or ‘What is your dream dinner party guest list, dead or alive?’ While it may seem silly to have such ice breaker questions, they usually snowball into conversation that isn’t as easy to catch in a bottle.”  Advertisement  I actually don’t want your help cleaning.",US,5 Things I Expect From My Guests When I Host A Party,,,,0.054,0.708,0.238,0.9998

During his new Netflix stand-up special, which premiered on the streaming service on Tuesday, the actor and comedian said that he suffered a brain bleed and stroke.  Advertisement  Foxx said that on April 11, 2023, he experienced a “bad headache,” and asked his friend for an aspirin, but “went out” before he could take it. He said he can’t remember the next 20 days.  The Oscar winner, who was in Atlanta when his health scare occurred, explained that the first doctor who saw him gave him a cortisone shot and sent him home. But Foxx’s sister later took him to another hospital after he appeared “lethargic.”  Advertisement  He said that a doctor at the second hospital told his sister that he was “having a brain bleed that led to a stroke,” and that the doctor told her: “If I don’t go in his head right now, we’re going to lose him.”  Foxx said that doctors were able to confirm he was having a stroke after a procedure, but that they weren’t able to determine where the bleeding in his brain was coming from.  The actor said doctors told his sister at the time that he “may be able to make a full recovery,” but that it was going to be “the worst year” of his life.  Foxx woke up on May 4, 2023. “I found myself in a wheelchair,” he said. “I couldn’t walk.”  Foxx’s daughter Corinne Foxx announced in a statement in April last year that her father was recovering after suffering a “medical complication,” though she didn’t divulge further details about the actor’s health condition.

Advertisement  What is a brain bleed?  A brain bleed, or intracranial hemorrhage, is a type of stroke, the brain equivalent of a heart attack. Brain bleeds are a life-threatening medical emergency that causes blood to pool between the brain and skull, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  There are two main areas where brain bleeds can occur, per the clinic’s website: within your skull, but outside of the brain tissue; or inside the brain tissue. They’re caused by “leaky, broken or burst” blood vessels.  This can happen due to several causes, such as head trauma, a blood clot, a brain tumor or a weak spot in a blood vessel wall, among other reasons.  Advertisement  What are the symptoms of a brain bleed?  The symptoms of a brain bleed include a sudden, painful headache that doesn’t go away and gets worse, as well as vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, pupils that are different sizes and paralysis, according to the Mayo Clinic.  How is a brain bleed diagnosed?  Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans and angiograms, are the best ways to determine the size and position of the bleeding.  Treatment for brain bleeds may include medication or surgery. Some brain hemorrhages may not require surgery, depending on the size, cause and location of the hemorrhage, as well as your general health.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-shapewear-bad-for-your-health_l_67575aefe4b0878021580cb4,Huffington Post,neutral,Business,,"Cat Gwynn via Getty Images  Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Sarah Hyland have admitted to wearing more than one pair of Spanx shapewear at a time to achieve their ideal shape. Similarly, stars and influencers like Kylie Jenner, Jessica Alba, Nicki Minaj and Coco Austin have promoted waist trainers to get an hourglass figure. Beauty may be pain, but at what cost?  HuffPost spoke to six experts, including doctors and physical therapists, about the good and bad of shapewear and corsetry.  Advertisement  How bad is shapewear for your body?  The most common reason people wear shapewear and corsets is to change their body’s shape and smooth out their appearance. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to look your best, but overdoing it can have serious consequences.  “Shapewear isn’t inherently good or bad — it all depends on how you wear it,” said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a chief medical adviser for Garage Gym Reviews.  Advertisement  Bhasha Mukherjee, a general practitioner and medical correspondent in the U.K., said, “I’ll refer to the old saying: The dose decides the poison. It depends on how many hours you’re wearing it, what kind of waist trainer/corset/shapewear you’re wearing, and how tight it is.”  “At the very least, wearing shapewear daily can result in discomfort, but it could also exacerbate anxiety, poor ventilation in the lungs or even musculoskeletal conditions,” said Dr. Michael Masi, a sports doctor and certified personal trainer. “Any body region where movement is repeatedly restricted over prolonged periods is subject to tissue deprivation, where muscles and tendons become weaker and less resistant to stress.”  “Although the use of shapewear might have specific benefits in certain situations, I never recommend them for day-to-day use,” said Darcie Pervier, a women’s health specialist, physical therapist and owner of Newburyport Wellness.    Let’s see all the different bodily functions they can affect.  Breathing/Lungs  “If [shapewear] is too tight and restricting your diaphragm, it can create difficulty breathing, restrict deep breathing and cause shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness,” said Dr. Laura Purdy, a board-certified family medicine physician.    “You don’t often allow enough space for your lungs to expand when taking a deep breath, so you might end up not taking in enough oxygen,” Mukherjee said. You also might struggle to expel all the air from your lungs, leading to a fainting episode (either from too little oxygen or too much carbon dioxide), she explained.  Advertisement  Stomach  “When shapewear puts pressure on your stomach area, it can cause digestive issues like acid reflux and heartburn because of the acid traveling up the esophagus,” said Purdy. It can also detract from the normal rhythm of organ movement, which can “disrupt how well the diaphragm, liver and gut move and shift.”  Bloomberg via Getty Images Kim Kardashian's Skims has upended the underwear industry, surging to almost $1 billion in net sales in 2023.  Compression garments can also cause a hiatal hernial, ”where part of your stomach is forced up and can protrude through a hole (hiatus) in the chest,” said Amy Cooke, a women’s exercise specialist.  Advertisement  Masi has noticed gut issues come up for a lot of his clients when they wear tight-fitting garments for a prolonged time. “The organs are designed to move and expand to accommodate, propel and mechanically digest food. If restricted, people may experience abdominal pain and digestive issues and may cause or exacerbate conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well,” he said.  Pelvic Floor  With shapewear, Mukherjee said, “essentially, you’re putting more and more pressure on the pelvic floor, which then pushes on the pelvic organs. You can sometimes have difficulty controlling your bladder.”  “Pressure from shapewear can cause the bladder, bowel, uterus and rectum to move lower down, increasing the risk of them prolapsing (bulging) into the vagina,” Cooke said.  Advertisement  “I have seen more than one client managing early-stage uterine prolapse use shapewear without realizing it could negatively impact their symptoms. Sadly, this can cause a mild prolapse to become significantly worse,” warned Cooke.  Skin  Depending on how tight the garment is and how long you wear it, you may experience irritation. “It can cause pressure sores on your skin from the pressure of the garment, which can result in skin irritation,” Mukherjee said.  Nerves  “Some people notice that their muscles feel weaker or sore if they wear shapewear all the time, as it keeps your body from moving naturally,” Dasgupta said.  Advertisement  Shapewear can even cause you to go numb: “If shapewear is too tight and is digging into your skin, it can cause numbness from the pressure on the nerve,” Purdy said.  “As a physical therapist, I sometimes see people with symptoms related to peripheral nerve compression, such as tingling or numbness in the thighs — a condition known as meralgia paresthetica. This results from the compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve [a nerve of the thigh],” Masi said.  Are there any positives that shapewear and corsets offer?  It depends. “Worn occasionally, shapewear can smooth out lines under clothes and offer some light support to your back, which might help you stand up straighter,” Dasgupta said.  Advertisement  Mukherjee noted that shapewear and corsetry may be helpful after any abdominal surgery, including pregnancy. “Your abdominal muscles can become weaker, you can get tears in the fibers in between, and that’s why some women after pregnancy have a physiological hernia. Essentially, the wall of the abdomen isn’t very strong, and your inner organs can poke through. Using a waist trainer can prevent hernias and give extra support to those muscles,” she said.  “Some say it helps with posture by activating and supporting your back,” Purdy said, but noted that shapewear may also weaken the back and abs with extended use.  Mukherjee agreed — ribbed corsets force you to sit upright, which can help you avoid slouching. However, a permanent posture change it’s likely related to habit formation rather than the corset itself, she added.  Advertisement  “Shapewear can also give extra support than might be lacking in the abdominal core muscles,” Mukherjee said, and recommended breathable fabrics, like compression garments, that aren’t too tight and can also help with inflammation of scars or burns.  Exercise and waist trainers  How about those waist trainers that you can wear in the gym to sweat more and shape your waist? Thanks to their shape, waist trainers (which should not be confused with weight-lifting trainer belts used to support your back when weight lifting) are essentially corsets.  The experts agreed that wearing waist trainers or other restrictive clothing while exercising should be avoided for various reasons, including sabotaging your workout.  Advertisement  “Physical activity requires a full range of motion, adequate breathing capacity, and proper core engagement. Restricting the diaphragm can lead to shallow breathing and reduced oxygen intake. The added external support of a corset may reduce the intrinsic support from your core, leading to less engagement and less effective exercise,” Masi said.  Plus, wearing something restrictive while working out will make sweat linger on the skin and may also cause skin barrier irritation or fungal growth, Mukherjee noted.  No type of waist trainer helps with weight loss or fat burn. “The garment doesn’t reduce body fat, increase muscle tone or permanently reshape tissues,” Masi said. “Compression garments are not a substitute for exercise, as they don’t effectively engage the core or other muscles in a way that would lead to long-term body shaping.”  Advertisement  How often should one wear shapewear?  “It is important to recognize that wearing shapewear for a night out is just fine as long as you have no other medical issues,” Pervier said.  If you have to wear shapewear or corsets occasionally, you must pick the right size and ensure they aren’t too tight. It shouldn’t be too restrictive, as that’s when issues arise. “The key is wearing shapewear in moderation and in a size that fits you,” Purdy added.

Many a skin-care-loving, jet-setting traveler has their TSA 3-1-1 game locked down and prepared to face the hectic holiday travel season. Each of their 3.4-ounce liquid, gel and aerosol skin care products is carefully packed in a clear 1-quart zip-top bag and ready for their carry-on bag.  However, with newer skin care products on the market like balms, jellies and sticks, it can be confusing to tell whether or not these products fall under the TSA 3-1-1 liquid rule for checked luggage. Your favorite cleansing balm can hold its shape, so would that mean it’s considered a solid? But cleansing balms can also be spread, so would it be considered a liquid?  Advertisement  And what about other items like sheet masks or powdered forms of skin care? If you have to wait hours to board your delayed flight, can you at least create a little slice of tranquility among the holiday travel chaos with a sheet mask? Or are some of these products at risk of being thrown into the trash at security?  To find out which products are allowed in your carry-on luggage and which you should pack in your checked luggage for holiday travels, HuffPost spoke to Eri Jenkins, a 17-year veteran of the Transportation Security Administration and Uniformed Advisor for TSA Security Operations.  Advertisement  The 411 on TSA’s 3-1-1  If you plan on packing your skin care lotions and potions in your carry-on luggage for your holiday flights, ensure they meet the TSA 3-1-1 rule, with each product packed in a travel-sized container of 3.4 ounces (100 ml) or less. Your products should then fit inside a single 1-quart bag.  Advertisement  While the rules around the carry-on status of your favorite liquid serums and gel night creams are relatively straightforward, some other products might leave travelers scratching their heads as to whether or not the 3-1-1 rule applies.  Cleansing Balms and Jellies  As a good rule of thumb, Jenkins recommends that if you can spread, rub or spray the skin care item, it should adhere to the TSA 3-1-1 rule if you want to pack it into your carry-on luggage.  So if you plan on wowing your family and friends with your favorite cleansing balm at the next big holiday gathering, ensure the container is either under 3.4 ounces or pack it in your checked luggage.  Advertisement  Powdered Skin Care  Powdered forms of skin care are another relatively new addition to the market. Skin care fanatics can find everything from cleansers to serums to even sunscreens in powdered form.  If you like your skin care like you like your donuts (powdered), you’re in luck! The TSA allows travelers to bring up to 12 ounces of powder-like substances in their carry-on luggage. Anything larger might require extra screening.  Jenkins notes that powdered forms of skin care should remain in their pre-mixed, powdered form to comply with the 12-ounce limit for powder-like substances.  Advertisement  Sheet Masks  In case you need a little extra pampering in the boarding area while your flight has been delayed for the third time, according to Jenkins, individually packaged sheet masks are (fortunately) allowed in carry-on luggage.  Baby and makeup wipes also receive the OK from TSA for your carry-on luggage.  Don’t Make These Carry-On Skin Care Mistakes  Opened or unopened, ALL containers must be 3.4 ounces or less.  If you frequently travel through international airports, you may have seen a fellow traveler waltz through security with full-sized skin care products purchased from duty-free.  While these sealed and unopened liquids (skin care and otherwise) from duty-free are allowed through TSA checkpoints under special conditions, don’t assume you can bring your full-sized products from home through the security checkpoint simply because they are unopened.  Advertisement  “The biggest misconception I see with passengers coming through the checkpoint is that an item can be any size as long as it’s not opened, and that’s not true,” Jenkins said. “So even if you have a 12-ounce bottle of lotion that’s still closed and has the manufacturer seal on it, it still will not be able to come through your carry-on bag.”  The TSA goes by container size, not the amount in the container.  Jenkins says another mistake she sees is passengers using a container that is larger than 3.4 ounces to store their skin care products, even when the contents are less than 3.4 ounces. If you pack your skin care in a larger container, you might run the risk of the item not making it past the TSA security checkpoint.  “We go by container size,” Jenkins said.  Even if you only have one ounce of the viral (and very pricey) SK-II essence left in the 11-ounce packaging you snagged from Costco, play it safe and either pack it in your checked luggage or leave it at home for you to enjoy when you return after the holidays.  Advertisement  Give yourself plenty of extra time at the airport.  In the recent past, it was the norm to arrive at the airport two hours before your flight’s departure. But nowadays, you may need to arrive even earlier— particularly during the busy holiday travel season.  Carter Langston, the press secretary for the TSA, cautions that travelers may need to plan to get to the airport even earlier, particularly if they need to return rental vehicles or check baggage during airport “rush hours.”  “Rush hours tend to be early in the morning between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. and in the afternoon between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.,” Langston said.  Advertisement  While arriving early to the airport will allow you to rest a little easier during your holiday travels, Jenkins says budging this extra time will also make the security checkpoint process easier for yourself and TSA officers.  “Travelers should also remember that anytime that they’re coming through the checkpoint, anything that will be in your accessible property could be subjected to additional screening,” Jenkins said.  Just in case a TSA officer needs to make an additional screening at the security checkpoint, Jenkins recommends making everything easier for both yourself and the officer by removing your 1-quart bag of products from your carry-on luggage before sending it through the X-ray machine.  Advertisement  “If [the skin care product] does have to go through additional screening, by it being outside of the bag, it’s easier for the officer to locate it,” Jenkins said.

If you’re an avid traveler, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your passport fill up with stamps, turning that once-blank travel document into a nostalgic little memory book.  But as delightful as it is to have a paper trail of evidence of your past adventures, your large stamp collection could lead to issues on future trips if you don’t pay close attention. That’s all due to a passport validity rule that many people overlook.  Advertisement  “One rule many travelers miss is needing an adequate number of blank pages in their passport for visas, and entry and exit stamps,” David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com, told HuffPost. “This is often forgotten, especially by those with passports close to expiring or having only a few blank pages.”  The U.S. State Department did not set the blank pages rule, which stems from other countries’ requirements for international visitors.  “Some countries require passports to have at least two to four blank visa or stamp pages, and thus, some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met,” said Caroline Tanner, a trends writer at The Points Guy.  Advertisement  Just as travelers often need to have at least three to six months of passport validity beyond the dates of an international trip, they may also need to have a certain number of empty pages depending on the requirements at their destination.  “The basis for this rule is maintaining proper security measures and part of the entry and exit requirements,” Alwadish said. “Not meeting this requirement can cause problems at borders. If the traveler does not have the required blank pages in the passport, the passport will technically be invalid and the person may not be allowed to board the plane.”  He emphasized that airlines can bar passengers who do not meet the requirement from boarding their flights to avoid complications at the international destination.  Advertisement  “If for whatever reason it is overlooked in the U.S., the traveler may take a big risk once they arrive at their destination country, as every border patrol officer has the right to determine the outcome,” Alwadish explained. “They may have travelers detained, pay a fine or let them pass.”  Taking that kind of risk in a foreign country is not advisable, he added. And there’s a long list of countries that have this rule in place. Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Germany, India, Belgium, South Africa, the Netherlands, Cuba, Iceland, Zimbabwe and Indonesia are among the destinations that require two blank pages. Countries that require one page include France, Japan, Mexico, Greece, Thailand, Australia, Morocco, Argentina and Vietnam, among others. But you’ll need at least three blank pages if you want to visit Namibia, Botswana, Madagascar and Zambia.  “While some pages may be full of stamps, others might have one ― and just one stamp means that that page is not empty,” Alwadish cautioned.  Advertisement  Immigration authorities in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have also emphasized that the “endorsement” pages found at the back of many passports are different from visa pages and thus do not count as blank pages for the purposes of entry and exit stamps. (Newer passports have the endorsement section closer to the front.)  Meanwhile, Armenia and Micronesia have no stated blank passport page requirements.  “Countries like Sweden and the Philippines don’t require a blank page on your passport, but rather sufficient space for entry and exit stamps,” Alwadish noted.  He recommended looking at the State Department’s website for a breakdown of the specific entry prerequisites for each country.  Advertisement  Jake Wyman via Getty Images Many avid travelers delight in their extensive collections of passport stamps, but it's important to check the blank page requirements before visiting an international destination.  Keep in mind that blank page rules don’t just apply to U.S. visitors, either.  “This is true for all incoming travelers to the country, regardless of nationality, based on requirements set by individual countries for incoming visitors,” Tanner said.  Over time, frequent travelers may not need to worry as much about having enough empty passport pages.

Advertisement  But for now, immigration officers still need to ensure there are enough pages for stamps and visas. So travelers must remain vigilant.  “It is always best to make sure your passport is valid and has at least two blank pages,” Alwadish noted. “If a traveler does not have enough blank pages available, they cannot add more to their physical book.”  As of 2016, the U.S. government does not allow travelers to add extra pages to their existing passports. If they need more pages, they must renew their passports.  Advertisement  People who often travel internationally might want to consider choosing the option for a bigger passport with more visa pages. It’s no extra cost, and all you have to do is check the box that says “large book” when you fill out the form.  If you have an impending trip abroad, there are ways to get a new passport in a rush on your own or by paying a third party for expedited service. And of course, the best way to avoid adding extra stress and hassle is to keep track of your passport and ensure it’s compliant throughout the year.",US,The 1 Big Mistake You Should Avoid With Your Passport,,,,0.049,0.874,0.077,0.9863
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/queef-vagina-fart-flatulence-sex-ano_l_675ca50fe4b08821cba78ed8,Huffington Post,neutral,Japan,,"Cavan Images via Getty Images Flatulence from your vagina during sex or physical activities like yoga is common and nothing to be ashamed of.  Queefing, as anyone with a vagina will tell you, can happen at some inopportune times: while you’re having sex, in the middle of a yoga class or during a visit to the gynecologist.  You may have heard some people refer to queefs as “vaginal farts” (charming). But while queefs do produce a toot-like sound, we can assure you that queefing is not the same as passing gas.  Advertisement  We talked to gynecologists and sex therapists to learn more about what causes queefs, some of the misconceptions about them and why they shouldn’t be as mortifying as we make them out to be.  What makes you queef, anyway?  Queefing is an involuntary bodily function that occurs when air is pushed into the vagina, gets temporarily trapped in the folds of the vaginal canal (called rugae) and is then released.  Advertisement  “Queefing happens when a penis, fingers or sex toy go in and out of the vagina bringing additional air along with it,” Sherry A. Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, California and the author of “She-ology: The Definitive Guide to Women’s Intimate Health,” told HuffPost. “Sex can involve a lot of thrusting of the penis in and out of the vagina, typically pushing extra air into a dead-end space.”  Certain sex positions, like doggy style where your pelvis is titled upwards, or abruptly switching from one position to another, may increase the likelihood of queefing. Even non-sexual activities, like putting in a tampon or menstrual cup, practicing yoga (like when you move out of an inversion pose) or your gyno inserting a speculum can lead to queefing.  “From my experience as an OB-GYN, almost every woman has experienced at least one episode of queefing some time during her life, sometimes even during a pelvic exam,” said Diana Hoppe, an OB-GYN in Encinitas, California.  While the gas that comes out of your rectum may have a foul odor (a result of bacterial activity in the gut), queefs are odorless, Hoppe added.  Advertisement  Can you prevent a queef?  And as OB-GYN Sheila Loanzon told Cosmopolitan, “If you try to contract the vaginal canal to prevent air from coming in, it can cause sex to be more painful.”  Advertisement  “Also, when doing any abdominal exercises or weight-bearing exercise, it is important to squeeze the pelvic floor while holding the core abdominal muscles tight,” Hoppe said. “Many women squeeze abdominal muscles but do not activate the pelvic floor at the same time, thus allowing the pelvic floor to sag, increasing the likelihood of air entering into vaginal canal.”  During sex, keeping the penis, fingers or sex toy inside you while you change positions could lessen your chances of queefing because it “gives air less of an opportunity to get into the vagina,” Jamil Abdur-Rahman, an OB-GYN and the chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vista Health System in Waukegan, Illinois, told Self.  Advertisement  And in theory, you could just avoid certain sex or yoga positions altogether. But what’s the fun in that?  When queefing does happen, don’t sweat it.  So why does this very normal bodily function feel so embarrassing in the moment, be it during doggy-style or downward dog? It really just comes down to that pesky noise, Hoppe said.  “The stigma is due to lack of understanding the difference between release of air from the vagina and flatulence,” she said. “The sound effects may be the same though, so culturally there may be a stigma or embarrassment due to this occurring ‘down there.’”  Advertisement  Sex therapist Vanessa Marin underscored the fact that queefing is normal, common and “not anything to be ashamed of.” Embracing the awkwardness of the moment can even make sex more enjoyable for both partners.  “Our bodies make funny noises sometimes, and that’s OK!” she said. “Plus, there are plenty of other goofy things about sex, like getting sweaty, slipping out, getting into awkward positions and so on. The more we can laugh about these kinds of things, the more fun we’ll have during sex.”  When a queef slips out mid-coitus, you have two choices: ignore that deflating balloon sound completely or quickly acknowledge it and move on. Marin prefers the latter route.  Advertisement  “It’s a personal preference, but I think it’s better to just quickly acknowledge it and laugh it off,” she said. “That way you don’t have to sit there thinking about it, anxiously wondering whether or not your partner heard it.”  Is queefing ever cause for concern?  Generally, queefing is nothing to be worried about. While rare, if queefing is accompanied by pain or a bad smell, you should make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any more serious issues.  “If queefing is associated with a foul odor, it may be an indication of a vaginal infection or possible fistula, an [abnormal] connection between rectum and vagina due to previous radiation treatment or surgery that causes stool or feces to come out of the vagina,” Hoppe said.  Advertisement  But for the most part, queefing is a normal, if slightly awkward, fact of life. So let’s not get so hung up on it, OK?",US,"Here’s Why You Queef During Sex.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

(AP) — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.

Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.

(Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

Left: Amazon MGM Studios; Right: Roadside Attractions  Unless folks are doing something like recording whole scenes of a movie on their cellphones, you generally don’t notice who else is in the audience with you at a movie theater. The lights fade to black, the screen brightens and everything — and everyone — around you virtually disappears. But sometimes taking stock of how others react to a film can tell you a lot about who becomes the arbiters of merit and why.  That’s especially true when you’re watching a Black movie.  An example that comes to mind is “12 Years a Slave,” which tells the harrowing true story of a free Black man who was abducted and sold into slavery in 1841. At a 2013 press screening for the film in Manhattan, an inclusive audience sat transfixed in front of the screen during multiple scenes of sexual and physical violence.  Advertisement  Perusing the theater during those moments revealed something interesting. Some Black viewers were stone-faced, while others seemed exhausted by the second or third brutality scene. Many of the white folks, though, were inconsolable — sobbing and blowing their noses. Perhaps that was on account of white guilt, a performative impulse, or because the film really is that stirring.  In any case, “12 Years a Slave,” a Steve McQueen-directed movie that unflinchingly portrays the horrors of white supremacy, was heralded by a predominantly white and so-called liberal Hollywood elite. And it went on to earn nine Oscar nominations.  There was another staggering Black drama released that same year that was also a nonfiction story dealing with systemic racism, though in a more modern context: “Fruitvale Station.” It earned exactly zero nominations from that same voting branch.  Advertisement  While the Ryan Coogler-directed film can hardly be accused of not engaging with the issue of whiteness through the lens of police brutality, there is a crucial difference between it and the aforementioned offering. It does not hinge on the racially motivated atrocity against its lead character or its perpetrator. Rather, it centers the Black human life that was cut short. It examines who the person was outside of the system of whiteness.  Ethan Herisse (left) and Brandon Wilson in ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  In essence, it’s not a film that necessarily brings white audiences into its story. It actually seems indifferent to whatever reaction they might have. A Hollywood voting establishment that, in spite of all its lip service, has always had an issue appreciating art that does not revolve around their lives or even their ills could see that as a detriment.  Advertisement  They often look for art they can laud that can at least give the appearance that they’re progressive despite showing all signs of the opposite. It’s a self-gratifying tactic that doesn’t serve the art at all, no matter how good it is.  It’s been over a decade since “12 Years a Slave” and “Fruitvale Station” were released, and white people’s proximity to a Black narrative still weighs heavily on their acclaim for it. This year’s “Nickel Boys” and “Exhibiting Forgiveness” are two other Black films that have had parallel journeys to the big screen and awards season. But their trajectories could not be more different — and for the same reason as their predecessors.  Similar to “12 Years a Slave,” “Nickel Boys,” an adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, is an unrelenting drama following the lives of two young Black men trying to survive an abusive and racist reform school in the 1960s. The performances are good. The movie’s technical merit, including its marvelous cinematography, has already helped it earn the attention of several awards bodies.  Advertisement  Despite it not even being released in limited theaters until Friday, there’s hardly a day that goes by in the last few months — since its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival this summer — that there isn’t press or hype about it. That includes numerous press screenings and initiatives.  But with the effects of systemic oppression being an impeding factor of the story, leaving little space to explore the characters’ humanity, it’s hard not to again wonder whether its appeal to arbitrated audiences is also that it is more for them to appreciate than others who might identify with their experiences.  André Holland (left) and Andra Day in ""Exhibiting Forgiveness."" Courtesy of Roadside Attractions  Advertisement  Director RaMell Ross said he didn’t intend for that to be the case, though. When the filmmaker was asked in an interview with Vanity Fair what his expectations are of audiences that are “older, very white and wealthier,” he replied that “Nickel Boys” “emerges from our centrality, and it ostensibly is for us, but I’m happy to give it to others.”  “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” on the other hand, doesn’t provoke that same question. It almost entirely wrestles with the complexities of its Black characters, and in ways Black audiences especially recognize. Systemic prejudices are understood as the reality in which they live, only because they are Black and it’s set in the present day, not because the plot informs that. There’s nary a moment when the film even gestures toward that to tell its story.  That helps create an intensely insulated film that centers a Black family whose drama is also deeply felt and astoundingly performed. The conflicts, joy and contradictions that propel the plot are of their own making — and not the result of a racially motivated antagonist. White people, come to think of it, are merely ornamental in the story.  Advertisement  It is unequivocally a film by and for Black people to grapple with among ourselves — one that has similarly affected Black audiences in the way “12 Years a Slave” moved white viewers. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” allows white audiences to enter its narrative incidentally only, while films like “Nickel Boys” and “12 Years a Slave” often engage directly with their white audiences through their own historical (and present-day) examination.  It’s a distinction that often results in the latter films being considered worthy of Hollywood’s highest honors.  Taking a look at the theatrical and post-theatrical odysseys of “Exhibiting Forgiveness” and “Nickel Boys” might help bring this into further focus. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is an original story that was amazingly green-lit in our sequel- and adaptation-obsessed culture and based on the personal experiences of writer-director Titus Kaphar, a first-time feature filmmaker.  Advertisement  “Nickel Boys” came with all the fanfare of a known author, an acclaimed literary honor under its belt and at least the assumption that its Jim Crow-era setting means that whiteness could obviously play a significant role in the story. Even Ross’ avant-garde filmmaking that shifts the camera and perspective between the two lead characters couldn’t deter an audience that was already locked in.  Herisse stars as Elwood in a moment from ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  Ross also told Vanity Fair that the process between the film being green-lit and going into production through Orion Pictures and Amazon MGM Studios was fairly smooth, to his own surprise. And since its Telluride premiere just a few months ago, “Nickel Boys” has experienced a constant whirlwind of praise from various awards bodies and audiences.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, Kaphar told me during an interview that “it was a fight” to get “Exhibiting Forgiveness” released in theaters. Like many filmmakers, especially Black filmmakers whose work is too often considered niche, Kaphar was approached about bringing the film to a streaming service.  Despite earning rave reviews following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it went months without being acquired, and then months later — not until October — it was released by Roadside Attractions. By then, many people had forgotten about it or just hadn’t heard much about it at all.  Save from a video-on-demand release and awards screeners available to voting press, the film hasn’t been able to achieve any major award nominations and hasn’t popped up on most “best of 2024” lists. (It made HuffPost’s roundup.) Unlike “Fruitvale Station,” it also failed to earn an Independent Spirit Award nomination or other award precursor nominations.  Advertisement  None of this discussion is to elevate any one Black film above another, suggest that a certain kind of Black film is better than the next, or even pit two films against each other. Both can and should be in the conversation.

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia’s opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.

He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads.

(South Korean Presidential Office/Yonhap via AP) via AP  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s parliament on Saturday impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his stunning and short-lived martial law decree, a move that ended days of political paralysis but set up an intense debate over Yoon’s fate, as jubilant crowds roared to celebrate another defiant moment in the country’s resilient democracy.  The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85. Yoon’s presidential powers and duties were subsequently suspended and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s No. 2 official, took over presidential powers later Saturday.  Advertisement  The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he’s thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon’s impeachment after ruling party lawmakers boycotted it last Saturday. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon’s impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon’s impeachment was an outcome driven by “the people’s ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.”  Advertisement  Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, “We have preserved the constitutional order!”  In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached.

Advertisement  Han, who became the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han’s office.  South Korea’s executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade and finance and was the ambassador to the U.S. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.  Advertisement  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred.  Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law.  The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon “committed rebellion that hurts peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.” It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.  Advertisement  Yoon remains defiant  In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon had rejected the rebellion charges, calling his order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it “a monster” and “anti-state forces” that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.  Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a “mad declaration of war” against his own people.  Observers say Yoon’s speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon’s approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.  Advertisement  Some of Yoon’s claims don’t align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.  Most notably, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that after martial law was announced, Yoon called him and asked for his troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he didn’t carry out Yoon’s orders.  Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.  Advertisement  In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers. Roh jumped to his death in 2009, after he had left office, amid a corruption scandal involving his family.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea.  He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested.

If the news these days overwhelms you, you’re hardly alone: America is as politically polarized as ever. Almost every day, there’s a new controversial Cabinet pick from President-elect Donald Trump. There are drawn-out wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and here in the U.S., some say we’re on the edge of a looming class war.  In short, we are living in bizarre, capital-letter Unprecedented Times. If you’re able to block it all out and not take on the stress, you’re lucky.  Advertisement  A week after Trump won the election, independent journalist Marisa Kabas wrote on Bluesky about how frenzied the news cycle makes her feel.  “There has to be a better way than sounding an alarm every single time a deranged Trump-related story drops,” she said. “It’s unhealthy and unsustainable. We need to find a way to stay informed without spiking cortisol and without losing sight of the bigger picture. I’m just...not sure how.”  Advertisement  A month later, Kabas says she’s still considering this question.  “When there’s a deluge of really intense news, I know my instinct is often ‘make it stop.’ But since I know the news is never going to stop, I’ve been trying in those moments to think instead of momentarily putting it aside,” said Kabas, who publishes The Handbasket, a newsletter about politics, media and power.  Advertisement  Kabas think people need to remind themselves that just because news is available to them at all times doesn’t mean they’re required to consume it. You can gauge your personal limit and clock out when you need to.  “This isn’t to say ignorance is bliss; at this really scary moment in history, some tolerance for distress is required to avoid being complicit in allowing this country to passively slide all the way into fascism,” she told HuffPost. “But if you’re overwhelmed, choose a few outlets you trust and read them as often as you find tolerable.”  What other steps can you take to manage the emotional impact stressful news has on you?

For me, that often looks like hitting a local trail with my queer chosen family. We hike, talk and hold space for each other as we navigate these challenging times. It’s a reminder that even in uncertainty, we have the power to create moments of connection and care.

Win/win.” ― Kabas  Focus on things that bring you joy, give you perspective and that are in your control.  “I step away from the news and focus in on the things in life that bring me joy (my infant son, my wife, our friends and family, music, running), give me perspective (the woods, the ocean, our long history as a resilient and adaptive trans community), and that I can control (how I show up for myself, my family, and my community, and the contributions I make every day in ways big and small to the collective and enduring effort to create a more peaceful and inclusive world).

This might be a bouquet of flowers, a scented candle or even a bottle of wine. But sometimes, a gifted item of food or drink can cause miscommunication between hosts and guests.  For instance, if a host thanks their guest for bringing a bottle of wine, but it never appears on the communal bar or dinner table, does that mean the host isn’t happy with the gift?  Advertisement  What are the rules and guidelines around edible and drinkable gifts, and how can hosts clearly communicate their expectations? To answer these questions, we turned to a group of modern etiquette experts and event professionals.  Serving or not serving gifted items is totally up to the host.  The first thing to remember about bringing a gift to a party is that, once given, the gift becomes the sole property of the host, and what happens to it is up to them.  Advertisement  “Host gifts, whether it is a bottle of wine, a handmade food item or a box of candy, are not expected to be opened and offered at the gathering unless the guest and host have discussed it and agreed to do so,” confirmed Renate Devin, the owner of the Boston School of Etiquette.  Jamila Musayeva, a certified etiquette coach and the author of “The Art of Entertaining at Home,” agreed, adding that “when you bring a bottle of wine, homemade cookies or any edible item as a gift, it’s thoughtful to remember that this is a gesture of appreciation, not an expectation for it to be served immediately. Hosts usually have planned their menu and wine selection, so a well-chosen gift is best viewed as something for them to enjoy later, unless they specifically ask you to contribute to the party offerings. It is up to the host to serve or open what the guest has brought because the host is in charge of planning the menu and deciding how and what to serve — particularly pairing of beverages with food.”  So if your friend doesn’t open the bottle of pinot noir that you brought to dinner, don’t take it personally. They’re likely planning to save it for another time!  The host should communicate whether guests are expected to contribute a dish or drink to the party.  Sit-down dinner events and potluck dinners abide by specific rules, but many house parties fall into a nebulous middle ground. Food will be served and the host is planning to provide the mains, but if a guest wants to contribute a side dish or a dessert (or a bottle of vino), the addition is often encouraged.  Advertisement  As a host, providing clear communication can chase away any doubts or misunderstandings about what a guest should bring, or whether they should bring something at all.  “If a host has thoughts or opinions on what guests should bring, they should communicate the expectation in advance,” suggested Melissa Ben-Ishay, the founder and CEO of the company Baked by Melissa. “Oftentimes, when my own guests ask what they can bring, I give them a category. Bring dessert, or bring an adult beverage — this helps the host weave these things into the serving plan.”  You can even be more specific with your guests about which items would be helpful for the meal, said Christine Schaub, the host of “Come on Over,” a web series that is available on YouTube and focuses on home entertaining. Schaub said that such a conversation might go like this: “A pinot grigio would pair beautifully with the salad course. Would you like to bring a bottle?” Then, if the guest asks “for a suggested vintner, be ready with affordable suggestions,” she added.  Advertisement  And if a guest shows up at your door with a gift but you’re not sure whether it’s intended to be shared at the party, Schaub said that you can pick up on some clues from the presentation. “If a beverage arrives in a gift bag, it is truly a gift — not a shareable,” she advised, noting that the same goes for food items.“It’s entirely up to the host whether to serve or save it for another time. If a beverage arrives hot or chilled (in an insulated tote), that’s your tip that [it was intended to] ... be served.”  It might seem tacky to include details about gifts in an invitation (since you as the host may not want guests to think that you expect a present), but Musayeva said there’s a way to express your preferred policy without seeming like a gift-grubber.  “If you’re hosting and prefer not to incorporate gifts into the event’s refreshments, feel free to mention it in a warm and subtle way ahead of time,” Musayeva suggested. “A quick message like ‘Looking forward to seeing everyone! Your presence is the best gift, but if you do bring something special, I’d love to enjoy it later on my own’ makes it clear without any pressure.”  Advertisement  Guests can also take the initiative to ask whether they should bring something.  Hosts have a lot of elements to juggle when preparing for a dinner or a party, so invitation details can sometimes fall by the wayside. If you receive an invite but still aren’t sure whether to bring a dish or a drink, don’t hesitate to shoot the host a quick text message or email.  “It is recommended to ask the host beforehand if one can contribute in any way to the party and what would be most suitable,” Musayeva pointed out. “Perhaps extra portions of cookies or fruits would be appreciated, or beverages. If that is the case, then it is acceptable to assume the host will serve what you brought.”  If you want to give an edible gift while avoiding ambiguity, stay clear of baked goods and wine.  Since gifts like wine and cookie platters could go either way in a “to serve immediately or not?” debate, you might consider a different option to prevent the host from wondering if your offering is meant to be shared.  Advertisement  Shannon Smith, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based private chef and the author of “The Hidden Table,” said possible food and drink gifts may include “gourmet olive oil or balsamic vinegar, artisan chocolates, or infused sea salts or seasonings.” On a similar note, Ben-Ishay said that she likes to “make homemade vanilla extract a year in advance and use that as a gift to bring [to parties]. It always feels extra special when it’s homemade.”  Musayeva noted that “when choosing a gift for a host, keeping their dietary preferences or alcohol choices in mind shows true thoughtfulness. Always bear in mind the religious/cultural background of the host, as alcoholic beverages and foods containing pork or cow meat might not be acceptable.”  A ‘no takebacks’ or ‘no givebacks’ policy always applies to party gifts.  Say a guest brings a bottle of wine to your dinner party, but you already have beverages mapped out for the night. If you’re tempted to hand the bottle back to your guest as they’re leaving, stop right there.  Advertisement  “It would be rude of the host to even attempt to give it back,” said August Abbott, an etiquette expert with the website JustAnswer. “This is a very, very common mistake.” Keep that bottle for later enjoyment (or regifting), but sending it back with the guest who presented it could be viewed as insulting.",US,Is It Rude If Your Dinner Party Host Didn't Open The Bottle Of Wine You Brought?,,,,0.022,0.793,0.186,0.9997

While it’s true that traveling with little ones will be different than what you’re used to, it’s still possible to indulge your wanderlust and explore new places as a family.  As you may have gathered from your paltry parental leave, the U.S. is not always the most welcoming country for families with children. Many other nations show more consideration for kids and parents in both their public policies and their cultural practices. Not all of these locales feature bathroom changing tables or stroller-friendly streets, but there is often a shared expectation that kids will be integrated into daily life, whether they’re riding public transit, dining out or visiting a national monument.  During one of our early forays abroad as parents, my wife and I took our 1-year-old to the Dominican Republic. We looked pretty ridiculous maneuvering our stroller through the cobblestone streets of old Santo Domingo, but everyone we interacted with was helpful and kind. A waiter in a traditional restaurant even picked up our baby and cheerfully walked around with him for a bit so that we could use both hands to enjoy our food. All our fellow diners got to watch our son return their smiles and bestow on him the standard “Dios le bendiga” (“God bless him”) that Dominicans offer every child who crosses their path.  Advertisement  Marie Holmes The author's son awaits lunch at a comedor in the Dominican Republic.  If you’re itching to roam beyond the U.S. with your kids, here are some recommendations from families with lots of travel experience. Of course, not every part of any country will be suited for kids, but these families were able to find child-friendly spots for making memories.  “The most important thing to remember there is that countries are not monoliths, and some parts of a city may be perfectly safe while others are not,” digital nomad and mom Courtney Orgias told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The Dominican Republic  In addition to a child-friendly culture, the all-inclusive resorts in beachy places like Puerto Plata can simplify life for families traveling with young ones.  “You don’t have to worry about lugging a carseat to multiple places or renting a car. They also typically have toddler pools, kids areas, activities and sometimes childcare. The buffets offer a variety of foods so there’s a good chance you’ll find something the baby/toddler will enjoy. The rooms also typically come with refrigerators for storing the baby’s food and milk,” Stephanie Claytor, founder of the brand Blacktrekking, told HuffPost.  Jamaica  Claytor mentions that similar all-inclusive accommodations, alongside white sand beaches and turquoise Caribbean water, are available in Jamaica.  Advertisement  “We took our son to Negril for his second birthday. Our favorite memory is of him dancing on the beach to reggae music during the all-white party on his birthday. We had no idea he could bust a move. He loved the party and reggae music. We of course were in the back away from the crowded dance floor but were still able to enjoy the DJ,” said Claytor.  She recommends looking for places that offer refrigerators (for breastfeeding parents who need to pump milk), ample shade and outdoor dining — “so that I’m not embarrassed when my son breaks out in loud singing or accidentally throws some food.”  With young children, almost any place can be kid-friendly. “Toddlers and babies are amused by the simplest things such as wood chips and stairways,” Claytor said. So if there’s a destination you’re keen to visit with your little one, you can probably find a way to make it work — just be ready to spend an afternoon collecting rocks instead of devouring your novel in the sun.  Advertisement  “Try to get out of your head any images of long afternoons lounging by the pool sipping cocktails,” said British travel blogger Jenny Lynn. “As a parent traveling with kids you still have to be ‘on,’” she continued. “But traveling provides you with a constantly changing backdrop to take on those daily parent chores, and with new adventures to experience together, daily life becomes all the more rewarding.”  Stephanie Claytor Claytor with her husband and child in Jamaica.  Portugal  “Lisbon can seem intimidating to explore with small kids because of all the hills — nobody wants to carry a toddler or push a stroller up a 30% incline — but we were able to take the bus to most places and found it to be efficient and clean; there were stops everywhere,” said Orgias.  Advertisement  Ample parks and green spaces allowed the kids to get their wiggles out and break up a day of sightseeing, she added.  Mexico  Public transportation also makes Mexico City (Mexico D.F.) more navigable for families, according to Orgias. It “has a great train system we were able to utilize and it’s very walkable, with lots of wonderful neighborhoods that are easy to explore on foot,” she said.  Advertisement  “Worrying about traveling with car seats and hopping in and out of ride shares and taxis is scary for a lot of parents,” she explained, but good public transportation options can allay these concerns.  Costa Rica  If your kids eat rice and beans, they’ll have always something to nosh on with gallo pinto at every meal. Maria De la O of Roam Family Travel told HuffPost that year-round access to fresh fruit also made it easy to keep kids satisfied.  There’s plenty to see, between the jungle and the beach. De la O and her family booked a tour via National Geographic Expeditions with local guides and saw about 20 different animals during their stay.  Advertisement  “We of course stayed in hotels with pools and allowed at least an hour or two a day just for the kids to do that,” she added.  Canada  “The CN Tower, Centre Island and the many summer festivals in the city all present opportunities for novelty, learning and bonding in Toronto. It’s a city with so much cultural diversity that there’s always something to do, indoor & outdoor,” said Orgias.  Advertisement  For animal lovers, Toronto features a zoo and an aquarium. In warmer months, you can take the ferry to Toronto Island Park and enjoy bike trails, picnic areas and even an amusement park. You can also tour Niagara Falls from Toronto.  On the French-Canadian side, Montreal offers plenty of parks, museums and historical sites to keep the whole family occupied. If you’re looking for European-style flair and cobblestone streets, check out Quebec City a bit further north.  Namibia  “Namibia gets our vote as one of the best places for intrepid family travel,” said Lynn, the U.K. travel blogger quoted above. She recommends forgoing an organized tour and instead renting your own 4x4 with roof tents. “The quality of roads is generally very good and the campsites are seriously fantastic (there’s often a pool),” she added.  Advertisement  In addition to “lunar landscapes” and safari wildlife, Namibia offers “a low malaria risk, good health care, German bakeries in every town, and an amazing climate,” Lynn said.  Morocco  “It’s so close to Europe, yet feels a world away with vibrant medinas, sweeping apricot-colored deserts, and jagged snow capped mountains,” Lynn said.

It was such a surreal experience to be able to gift them with these amazing bucket list activities.”  She described Marrakech as “a fast paced city that allows kids and  adults alike to get wrapped up in the blend of rich cultures.”  Lynn said the country is “very doable” by car.  “Kids will love sandboarding in the Sahara Desert, trekking the Atlas Mountains on a mule, or surfing the waves in Essaouira” — a coastal town Lynn found remarkably stroller-friendly.

Lynn says her kids enjoyed sticky rice, banana pancakes, mango and other tropical fruits.

De la O recommended European destinations in general for travel with a baby. “Pushing a sleeping child in a stroller or walking them in a Baby Bjorn or baby backpack is a perfect way to sightsee, so take advantage of the museums and Gothic churches you won’t be able to enjoy when your child gets a little older.”",US,10 Destinations To Consider For Your Next Family Vacation,,,,0.02,0.82,0.16,0.9998

If you’re a living, breathing human on this planet, chances are that someone, at some point, has urged you to eat your fruits and vegetables. There are good reasons for that: Eating a diet low in fruit and veggies, and high in saturated fats, puts you at risk of developing heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It only makes sense, then, that produce-forward meal plans protect your cardiovascular health. These diets are known to help control risk factors for heart disease like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. (However, medication is necessary sometimes, too.)  Advertisement  The Mediterranean diet is a common heart-healthy approach, but there’s another option that may also be key to lowering your cholesterol and your risk of coronary artery disease: the portfolio diet.  Below, experts share the rundown on this plant-forward meal plan and why it’s worth trying.  What is the portfolio diet?  “The portfolio diet was proposed about 20 years ago, and it has a lot in common with other heart-healthy diets that that you heard of, such as a Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet and a whole food, plant-based diet,” said Dr. Sarah Hull, an associate professor of medicine in cardiology at Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut.  Advertisement  “The name comes from the fact that this diet includes a portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods, so foods that reduce mostly the bad cholesterol in the diet,” noted Kristina Petersen, an associate professor in the department of nutritional sciences at Pennsylvania State University.  The portfolio diet is made up of four different food profiles, Melissa Prest, a clinical nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told HuffPost via email. It encourages the consumption of plant-based protein, plant sterols (a natural compound that helps lower cholesterol levels), soluble fiber and monounsaturated fat.  This means “eating a lot of foods like beans, lentils, soy, nuts and seeds, fruits, vegetables and whole grains as a way to obtain those foods, which basically, again, is very similar to whole food plant-based diet,” Hull said.  Some other heart-healthy diets, like the Mediterranean diet and the DASH eating plan, also include animal products like fish and poultry, and dairy products like yogurt and cheese. But the portfolio diet is vegan — which means if you intend to follow the diet exactly, you’ll need to remove any animal products from your rotation.  Advertisement  The portfolio diet specifically focuses on cholesterol, so it’s a good option if you struggle with that.  According to Petersen, the portfolio diet is not as well-studied as the Mediterranean diet, but the data that is available shows it can significantly benefit your cardiovascular health.  “There have been several studies done where they’ve shown pretty substantial lowering of LDL cholesterol ― so the bad cholesterol that increases risk of heart disease ― with this diet,” Petersen said. “In the original study, the lowering was about 29% in four weeks.”  Advertisement  “And then [researchers] did a subsequent study where they actually compared following this diet with lovastatin, which is a pharmaceutical agent to lower cholesterol, and they actually saw a pretty comparable lowering of LDL,” Petersen said. “So we have quite a bit of evidence that it lowers LDL cholesterol, and this is really what the diet is best known for.”  There are still health rewards even if you just add parts of the portfolio diet to your lifestyle. “Each of the four portfolios can reduce cholesterol levels by 5-10%,” Prest said.  Lowering bad cholesterol is “an important part of preventing and treating cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and stroke,” Hull said.  Advertisement  Research also shows that people who follow the portfolio diet are 14% less likely to develop coronary heart disease and have a stroke, according to the American Heart Association.  There are also other health benefits to the portfolio diet: It’s anti-inflammatory and can help people reach their daily fiber goal (most Americans are fiber deficient), Hull said. Women need between 21 and 25 grams of fiber each day, and men need between 30 and 38 grams daily.  martin-dm via Getty Images Nuts and seeds are a key part of this heart-healthy diet.  Advertisement  Here’s how you can take steps to add the portfolio diet to your lifestyle:  “Thinking about making incremental changes rather than making huge, sweeping changes is one of the most important principles to keep in mind,” Hull said. “So, the first thing is to think about [is], ‘What’s my biggest barrier to incorporating healthy changes?’”  If money is an issue, consider buying frozen fruits and veggies instead of fresh — they’ll last longer and are usually cheaper than the fresh alternative, Hull suggested. Bulk dried legumes, such as beans and lentils, are also more economical, she noted.  If your issue is time, consider meal prepping on the weekends, and look up plant-based, make-ahead recipes. Or if you just don’t know how to prep plant-based meals, consider talking to your doctor or a dietitian.  Advertisement  You can start small by focusing on one meal a day. For example, you could begin by eating oatmeal topped with nuts or seeds for breakfast, Petersen said. Or you could try following the portfolio diet at lunch by making grain bowls with quinoa or brown rice topped with chickpeas, veggies and tofu.  Even just snacking on unsalted nuts, apples and peanut butter, or carrots and hummus is part of this diet, Hull noted.  The portfolio diet still has benefits even if you don’t completely follow it.  Let’s be real: Going from a meat-based diet to a totally vegan meal plan is a big ask. Luckily, you don’t have to go fully vegan to see cardiovascular benefits.  Advertisement  “I think you can still incorporate the key features of the portfolio diet [such as whole grains, nuts, vegetables, beans and fruit] without excluding animal products if you want to include those,” Petersen said. “We have a lot of evidence for viscous fiber, plant sterols, soy and nuts reducing cholesterol levels, so if you just ate more of those foods, you would see cholesterol lowering.”  It’s true that you’ll get the greatest health benefits out of this diet if you follow it to the letter. But even just following it when you can is also good for you.  “The more adherent you can be to a diet like the portfolio diet ― or any predominantly whole food, plant-based diet ― the more benefit you can expect to get in terms of lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as lowering risk of cancer and certain metabolic diseases as well,” Hull said.",US,Want To Lower Your Heart Disease Risk?

I adore hosting, but at the end of December, I swear up and down that I’ll never host again, never drink again, and that next year is my time to get those abs I know are hidden somewhere.  Advertisement  I think it is safe to say my closest group of friends enjoys (nay, expects) this annual party. I refuse to disappoint people I love dearly, so I’m elated to host over and over again.  But my guests don’t get off that easy. I expect a few things from my nearest and dearest in regards to a dinner party. Nothing should elicit anyone to clutch their pearls, but if so, hold on tight.  Advertisement  Being fashionably late is applauded.  Promptness is, yes, very important in life. Time is precious, and if someone is wasting that preciousness, that is — to me — punishable by many, many eyerolls and heavy sighs. But in the case of my Christmas party, I’m applauding a 5-to-10-minute delay.  Advertisement  If the invitation states the party begins at 7 p.m., showing up on the dot can be stressful if I’m still basting a turkey or slicing vegetables for a salad (read: reheating chicken cacciatore I bought from a local catering company) so, take a beat between parking your car or getting out of your Uber. Tie your shoe in slow-motion, if need be. A slight delay means your host has a little wiggle room.  Etiquette expert Mariah Grumet, the founder and instructor of Old Soul Etiquette, says using a 10-minute delay is the acceptable thing to do. “For a social event such as a Christmas party, the proper etiquette is to aim to arrive on time or within 10-15 minutes of the invitation time. It would be considered poor etiquette to arrive at someone’s social event early, as you’d want to give your host every last second to put their finishing touches on their event. Beyond 15 minutes would simply be considered late, which is definitely rude to your host! There is a sweet spot, and for your 7 p.m. party, that is 7-7:15 p.m., not 6:59 p.m.”  If you offer to bring something, be specific.  Depending on the level of your party (potluck, family style, fully catered) you might have people ask, “Can I bring anything?” This is a lovely notion, but a conflicting one. While I’d love not to make dessert or put together a salad on top of everything else that needs to be done, I’m not necessarily going to dole out roles for my friends, either. Instead, I’d love someone to just claim a dish. “I make a mean charcuterie board, can I bring that?” would actually alleviate a lot of my stress and financial burden of hosting.  Advertisement  Transferring a piping-hot lasagna might not be in the cards, but a lot of dishes can easily be prepared ahead or, at the very least, out of the host’s way — even if that means cutting cucumbers in a laundry room.  Bring something you’d want to drink, in case the well runs dry.  In conjunction with offering to bring something, if you know other people are drinking alcoholic beverages, you can bring an option to be shared among the guests. Something bottled is the obvious choice: wine, beer or champagne.  Hosting can add up quickly and alcohol is a fairly big factor in that. Contributing to the communal pile is always appreciated. And, if it’s not touched or open, snag it back if you wish!  Advertisement  Olga Pankova via Getty Images Be ready for the hosts to crack open the bottle you gave them at the dinner party; but not everyone will.  While I believe this is absolutely appropriate in a smaller setting and with close friends, etiquette aficionado Mariah Grumet does not: “As a guest, it is absolutely appropriate to ask your host what you can bring when you respond to their invitation. If they ask you to bring something to drink to share, or bring something you enjoy drinking (alcohol or not), by all means, bring it! If no one drinks it, I would advise leaving it as a bonus for your host.  “However, if your host insists that you do not bring anything, you want to respect their wishes. There’s a good chance they planned out their menu and you don’t want to spring something on them that they were not expecting. In this case, it’s best to bring a gift they can open at a later time, such as a festive set of cocktail napkins.”  Advertisement  If you don’t know someone well, please engage.  An under-appreciated stressor in the art of hosting is the omnipresent question, will everyone get along? As a guest who doesn’t know many people, entering a house full of friends sends you right back to the elementary school playground. So let’s put this in writing.  Guests, won’t you please engage in interesting and meaningful conversation with each other?! Inclusion seems to be taught to children and teenagers (or attempted, at the very least), but what about in adulthood? Sit down next to someone you don’t know and engage! Be it the year(s) of COVID isolation, the comfort in the known or laziness, it seems people have stopped engaging in new interactions.  Hanna Ray Flores and Lea Raymond are the duo behind Hauste, a website dedicated to helping you host the best party. They have some enlightening insight into how to make guests feel comfortable during an intimate dinner party. First, “always offer your guest a beverage upon entering. A drink in hand can break the ice and spark comfort,” they said. Always have a few good dinner party questions in your back pocket: “If conversation is falling flat, don’t hesitate to pull out your go-to dinner party questions like, ‘What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?’ or ‘What is your dream dinner party guest list, dead or alive?’ While it may seem silly to have such ice breaker questions, they usually snowball into conversation that isn’t as easy to catch in a bottle.”  Advertisement  I actually don’t want your help cleaning.",US,5 Things I Expect From My Guests When I Host A Party,,,,0.054,0.708,0.238,0.9998

During his new Netflix stand-up special, which premiered on the streaming service on Tuesday, the actor and comedian said that he suffered a brain bleed and stroke.  Advertisement  Foxx said that on April 11, 2023, he experienced a “bad headache,” and asked his friend for an aspirin, but “went out” before he could take it. He said he can’t remember the next 20 days.  The Oscar winner, who was in Atlanta when his health scare occurred, explained that the first doctor who saw him gave him a cortisone shot and sent him home. But Foxx’s sister later took him to another hospital after he appeared “lethargic.”  Advertisement  He said that a doctor at the second hospital told his sister that he was “having a brain bleed that led to a stroke,” and that the doctor told her: “If I don’t go in his head right now, we’re going to lose him.”  Foxx said that doctors were able to confirm he was having a stroke after a procedure, but that they weren’t able to determine where the bleeding in his brain was coming from.  The actor said doctors told his sister at the time that he “may be able to make a full recovery,” but that it was going to be “the worst year” of his life.  Foxx woke up on May 4, 2023. “I found myself in a wheelchair,” he said. “I couldn’t walk.”  Foxx’s daughter Corinne Foxx announced in a statement in April last year that her father was recovering after suffering a “medical complication,” though she didn’t divulge further details about the actor’s health condition. The actor and his family have since publicly shared updates about his recovery.  Advertisement  In March, Foxx teased his comedy stand-up, saying that he planned to reveal details about his health scare, but that he wanted to “do it in a funny way.”  “We’re gonna be on the stage. We’re gonna get back to the stand-up sort of roots,” he said at the time.  Kevin Winter via Getty Images Brain bleeds like Jamie Foxx's often show some important warning signs.  Advertisement  What is a brain bleed?  A brain bleed, or intracranial hemorrhage, is a type of stroke, the brain equivalent of a heart attack. Brain bleeds are a life-threatening medical emergency that causes blood to pool between the brain and skull, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  There are two main areas where brain bleeds can occur, per the clinic’s website: within your skull, but outside of the brain tissue; or inside the brain tissue. They’re caused by “leaky, broken or burst” blood vessels.  This can happen due to several causes, such as head trauma, a blood clot, a brain tumor or a weak spot in a blood vessel wall, among other reasons.  Advertisement  What are the symptoms of a brain bleed?  The symptoms of a brain bleed include a sudden, painful headache that doesn’t go away and gets worse, as well as vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, pupils that are different sizes and paralysis, according to the Mayo Clinic.  How is a brain bleed diagnosed?  Imaging tests, such as CT scans, MRI scans and angiograms, are the best ways to determine the size and position of the bleeding.  Treatment for brain bleeds may include medication or surgery. Some brain hemorrhages may not require surgery, depending on the size, cause and location of the hemorrhage, as well as your general health.  Advertisement  The Cleveland Clinic states that you may need rehabilitation after a brain bleed to “help you regain the functions needed for daily living and prevent future brain bleeds.”",US,Jamie Foxx Reveals Life-Threatening Condition That Led To His Hospitalization,,,,0.1,0.841,0.059,-0.9853
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-shapewear-bad-for-your-health_l_67575aefe4b0878021580cb4,Huffington Post,neutral,Japan,,"Cat Gwynn via Getty Images  Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Sarah Hyland have admitted to wearing more than one pair of Spanx shapewear at a time to achieve their ideal shape. Similarly, stars and influencers like Kylie Jenner, Jessica Alba, Nicki Minaj and Coco Austin have promoted waist trainers to get an hourglass figure. Beauty may be pain, but at what cost?  HuffPost spoke to six experts, including doctors and physical therapists, about the good and bad of shapewear and corsetry.  Advertisement  How bad is shapewear for your body?  The most common reason people wear shapewear and corsets is to change their body’s shape and smooth out their appearance. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to look your best, but overdoing it can have serious consequences.  “Shapewear isn’t inherently good or bad — it all depends on how you wear it,” said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a chief medical adviser for Garage Gym Reviews.  Advertisement  Bhasha Mukherjee, a general practitioner and medical correspondent in the U.K., said, “I’ll refer to the old saying: The dose decides the poison. It depends on how many hours you’re wearing it, what kind of waist trainer/corset/shapewear you’re wearing, and how tight it is.”  “At the very least, wearing shapewear daily can result in discomfort, but it could also exacerbate anxiety, poor ventilation in the lungs or even musculoskeletal conditions,” said Dr. Michael Masi, a sports doctor and certified personal trainer. “Any body region where movement is repeatedly restricted over prolonged periods is subject to tissue deprivation, where muscles and tendons become weaker and less resistant to stress.”  “Although the use of shapewear might have specific benefits in certain situations, I never recommend them for day-to-day use,” said Darcie Pervier, a women’s health specialist, physical therapist and owner of Newburyport Wellness.    Let’s see all the different bodily functions they can affect.  Breathing/Lungs  “If [shapewear] is too tight and restricting your diaphragm, it can create difficulty breathing, restrict deep breathing and cause shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness,” said Dr. Laura Purdy, a board-certified family medicine physician.    “You don’t often allow enough space for your lungs to expand when taking a deep breath, so you might end up not taking in enough oxygen,” Mukherjee said. You also might struggle to expel all the air from your lungs, leading to a fainting episode (either from too little oxygen or too much carbon dioxide), she explained.  Advertisement  Stomach  “When shapewear puts pressure on your stomach area, it can cause digestive issues like acid reflux and heartburn because of the acid traveling up the esophagus,” said Purdy. It can also detract from the normal rhythm of organ movement, which can “disrupt how well the diaphragm, liver and gut move and shift.”  Bloomberg via Getty Images Kim Kardashian's Skims has upended the underwear industry, surging to almost $1 billion in net sales in 2023.  Compression garments can also cause a hiatal hernial, ”where part of your stomach is forced up and can protrude through a hole (hiatus) in the chest,” said Amy Cooke, a women’s exercise specialist.  Advertisement  Masi has noticed gut issues come up for a lot of his clients when they wear tight-fitting garments for a prolonged time. “The organs are designed to move and expand to accommodate, propel and mechanically digest food. If restricted, people may experience abdominal pain and digestive issues and may cause or exacerbate conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well,” he said.  Pelvic Floor  With shapewear, Mukherjee said, “essentially, you’re putting more and more pressure on the pelvic floor, which then pushes on the pelvic organs. You can sometimes have difficulty controlling your bladder.”  “Pressure from shapewear can cause the bladder, bowel, uterus and rectum to move lower down, increasing the risk of them prolapsing (bulging) into the vagina,” Cooke said.  Advertisement  “I have seen more than one client managing early-stage uterine prolapse use shapewear without realizing it could negatively impact their symptoms. Sadly, this can cause a mild prolapse to become significantly worse,” warned Cooke.  Skin  Depending on how tight the garment is and how long you wear it, you may experience irritation. “It can cause pressure sores on your skin from the pressure of the garment, which can result in skin irritation,” Mukherjee said.  Nerves  “Some people notice that their muscles feel weaker or sore if they wear shapewear all the time, as it keeps your body from moving naturally,” Dasgupta said.  Advertisement  Shapewear can even cause you to go numb: “If shapewear is too tight and is digging into your skin, it can cause numbness from the pressure on the nerve,” Purdy said.  “As a physical therapist, I sometimes see people with symptoms related to peripheral nerve compression, such as tingling or numbness in the thighs — a condition known as meralgia paresthetica. This results from the compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve [a nerve of the thigh],” Masi said.  Are there any positives that shapewear and corsets offer?  It depends. “Worn occasionally, shapewear can smooth out lines under clothes and offer some light support to your back, which might help you stand up straighter,” Dasgupta said.  Advertisement  Mukherjee noted that shapewear and corsetry may be helpful after any abdominal surgery, including pregnancy. “Your abdominal muscles can become weaker, you can get tears in the fibers in between, and that’s why some women after pregnancy have a physiological hernia. Essentially, the wall of the abdomen isn’t very strong, and your inner organs can poke through. Using a waist trainer can prevent hernias and give extra support to those muscles,” she said.  “Some say it helps with posture by activating and supporting your back,” Purdy said, but noted that shapewear may also weaken the back and abs with extended use.  Mukherjee agreed — ribbed corsets force you to sit upright, which can help you avoid slouching. However, a permanent posture change it’s likely related to habit formation rather than the corset itself, she added.  Advertisement  “Shapewear can also give extra support than might be lacking in the abdominal core muscles,” Mukherjee said, and recommended breathable fabrics, like compression garments, that aren’t too tight and can also help with inflammation of scars or burns.  Exercise and waist trainers  How about those waist trainers that you can wear in the gym to sweat more and shape your waist? Thanks to their shape, waist trainers (which should not be confused with weight-lifting trainer belts used to support your back when weight lifting) are essentially corsets.  The experts agreed that wearing waist trainers or other restrictive clothing while exercising should be avoided for various reasons, including sabotaging your workout.  Advertisement  “Physical activity requires a full range of motion, adequate breathing capacity, and proper core engagement. Restricting the diaphragm can lead to shallow breathing and reduced oxygen intake. The added external support of a corset may reduce the intrinsic support from your core, leading to less engagement and less effective exercise,” Masi said.  Plus, wearing something restrictive while working out will make sweat linger on the skin and may also cause skin barrier irritation or fungal growth, Mukherjee noted.  No type of waist trainer helps with weight loss or fat burn. “The garment doesn’t reduce body fat, increase muscle tone or permanently reshape tissues,” Masi said. “Compression garments are not a substitute for exercise, as they don’t effectively engage the core or other muscles in a way that would lead to long-term body shaping.”  Advertisement  How often should one wear shapewear?  “It is important to recognize that wearing shapewear for a night out is just fine as long as you have no other medical issues,” Pervier said.  If you have to wear shapewear or corsets occasionally, you must pick the right size and ensure they aren’t too tight. It shouldn’t be too restrictive, as that’s when issues arise. “The key is wearing shapewear in moderation and in a size that fits you,” Purdy added.

Many a skin-care-loving, jet-setting traveler has their TSA 3-1-1 game locked down and prepared to face the hectic holiday travel season. Each of their 3.4-ounce liquid, gel and aerosol skin care products is carefully packed in a clear 1-quart zip-top bag and ready for their carry-on bag.  However, with newer skin care products on the market like balms, jellies and sticks, it can be confusing to tell whether or not these products fall under the TSA 3-1-1 liquid rule for checked luggage. Your favorite cleansing balm can hold its shape, so would that mean it’s considered a solid? But cleansing balms can also be spread, so would it be considered a liquid?  Advertisement  And what about other items like sheet masks or powdered forms of skin care? If you have to wait hours to board your delayed flight, can you at least create a little slice of tranquility among the holiday travel chaos with a sheet mask? Or are some of these products at risk of being thrown into the trash at security?  To find out which products are allowed in your carry-on luggage and which you should pack in your checked luggage for holiday travels, HuffPost spoke to Eri Jenkins, a 17-year veteran of the Transportation Security Administration and Uniformed Advisor for TSA Security Operations.  Advertisement  The 411 on TSA’s 3-1-1  If you plan on packing your skin care lotions and potions in your carry-on luggage for your holiday flights, ensure they meet the TSA 3-1-1 rule, with each product packed in a travel-sized container of 3.4 ounces (100 ml) or less. Your products should then fit inside a single 1-quart bag.  Advertisement  While the rules around the carry-on status of your favorite liquid serums and gel night creams are relatively straightforward, some other products might leave travelers scratching their heads as to whether or not the 3-1-1 rule applies.  Cleansing Balms and Jellies  As a good rule of thumb, Jenkins recommends that if you can spread, rub or spray the skin care item, it should adhere to the TSA 3-1-1 rule if you want to pack it into your carry-on luggage.  So if you plan on wowing your family and friends with your favorite cleansing balm at the next big holiday gathering, ensure the container is either under 3.4 ounces or pack it in your checked luggage.  Advertisement  Powdered Skin Care  Powdered forms of skin care are another relatively new addition to the market. Skin care fanatics can find everything from cleansers to serums to even sunscreens in powdered form.  If you like your skin care like you like your donuts (powdered), you’re in luck! The TSA allows travelers to bring up to 12 ounces of powder-like substances in their carry-on luggage. Anything larger might require extra screening.  Jenkins notes that powdered forms of skin care should remain in their pre-mixed, powdered form to comply with the 12-ounce limit for powder-like substances.  Advertisement  Sheet Masks  In case you need a little extra pampering in the boarding area while your flight has been delayed for the third time, according to Jenkins, individually packaged sheet masks are (fortunately) allowed in carry-on luggage.  Baby and makeup wipes also receive the OK from TSA for your carry-on luggage.  Don’t Make These Carry-On Skin Care Mistakes  Opened or unopened, ALL containers must be 3.4 ounces or less.  If you frequently travel through international airports, you may have seen a fellow traveler waltz through security with full-sized skin care products purchased from duty-free.  While these sealed and unopened liquids (skin care and otherwise) from duty-free are allowed through TSA checkpoints under special conditions, don’t assume you can bring your full-sized products from home through the security checkpoint simply because they are unopened.  Advertisement  “The biggest misconception I see with passengers coming through the checkpoint is that an item can be any size as long as it’s not opened, and that’s not true,” Jenkins said. “So even if you have a 12-ounce bottle of lotion that’s still closed and has the manufacturer seal on it, it still will not be able to come through your carry-on bag.”  The TSA goes by container size, not the amount in the container.  Jenkins says another mistake she sees is passengers using a container that is larger than 3.4 ounces to store their skin care products, even when the contents are less than 3.4 ounces. If you pack your skin care in a larger container, you might run the risk of the item not making it past the TSA security checkpoint.  “We go by container size,” Jenkins said.  Even if you only have one ounce of the viral (and very pricey) SK-II essence left in the 11-ounce packaging you snagged from Costco, play it safe and either pack it in your checked luggage or leave it at home for you to enjoy when you return after the holidays.  Advertisement  Give yourself plenty of extra time at the airport.  In the recent past, it was the norm to arrive at the airport two hours before your flight’s departure. But nowadays, you may need to arrive even earlier— particularly during the busy holiday travel season.  Carter Langston, the press secretary for the TSA, cautions that travelers may need to plan to get to the airport even earlier, particularly if they need to return rental vehicles or check baggage during airport “rush hours.”  “Rush hours tend to be early in the morning between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. and in the afternoon between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.,” Langston said.  Advertisement  While arriving early to the airport will allow you to rest a little easier during your holiday travels, Jenkins says budging this extra time will also make the security checkpoint process easier for yourself and TSA officers.  “Travelers should also remember that anytime that they’re coming through the checkpoint, anything that will be in your accessible property could be subjected to additional screening,” Jenkins said.  Just in case a TSA officer needs to make an additional screening at the security checkpoint, Jenkins recommends making everything easier for both yourself and the officer by removing your 1-quart bag of products from your carry-on luggage before sending it through the X-ray machine.  Advertisement  “If [the skin care product] does have to go through additional screening, by it being outside of the bag, it’s easier for the officer to locate it,” Jenkins said.
