Don’t cancel your flight just yet,"Editor’s note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.  CNN —  In travel news this week: the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards, why you shouldn’t gift-wrap methamphetamine, plus infrastructure megaprojects around the world.  Bridge and tunnel crowd  There’s been a whole bunch of international infrastructure projects in the news this week, with a strong focus on digging.  Busy beavers and merry moles have been chattering about resurfaced plans for a $20 trillion transatlantic tunnel that could theoretically link London and New York in just an hour using vacuum tube technology. That’s 3,000 miles of burrowing, mind, which Newsweek estimates could take the best part of a millennium if construction proceeded at the same rate as Europe’s Channel Tunnel.  In plans that are actually happening, Norway broke ground last month on its Rogfast project, which promises to be the world’s longest, deepest undersea road tunnel. Elsewhere in northern Europe, the world’s longest road and rail tunnel, the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel between Denmark and Germany, is slated to open in 2029.  Southern Europe isn’t shy of a project or two, either. Construction of a new bridge linking Greece and Turkey might be closer to getting underway, the Greek Reporter said Friday.  Over near the western end of Europe, the UK is busy building one of the world’s most expensive railway projects, known as HS2 (High Speed 2), which now costs an almighty $416 million per mile. However, many people think it’s pointless.  That comes a few years after the UK resurfaced plans for what would have been one of the world’s most ambitious bridges, linking Britain and Ireland. It was to cross just a 12-mile stretch, but the waters were deep enough to submerge the Eiffel Tower. Then there was the matter of all the radioactive waste and unexploded munitions. Unsurprisingly, plans were dropped.  Baggage blues  A top musician who played at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was forced to cancel a concert this week after Air Canada refused to give his multi-million-dollar cello a seat on the plane.  For others, the trouble only starts at the baggage carousel, although there’s progress on easing some of the pain of that. United Airlines has rolled out a new way to track lost luggage with AirTags, with users being able to share location information directly with the airline. Other carriers, including Delta, Lufthansa and Qantas, are set to follow suit.  Finally, Japan Airlines has announced a baggage delivery service for travelers that will allow luggage to be dropped off at customers’ hotels for a fee. The idea is to reduce overcrowding on Tokyo’s public transport.  Naughty or nice?  It’s always a bad idea to put wrapped Christmas presents in your airplane luggage – if they raise concerns with airport security, they’re likely to be unwrapped.  It’s an even worse idea when the “presents” are actually 10 kilos of methamphetamine, as happened at a New Zealand airport this week.  This Christmas, we hope that your holidays are not felonious, but felicitous — like American Jennea and Dutchman Arthur.  Jennea’s flight from Mozambique was delayed and she missed her train out of London to see her loved ones for Christmas. Then she met her future husband on the platform.

Barrie, echoing a sentiment long expressed by the human race in an effort to cheat death.  The quest to unlock the secrets of longevity has been the topic of scientific study for decades. And some of the greatest lessons about living a long life come from nature itself.  Take Jonathan the giant tortoise, for instance. It is believed that the tortoise, a resident of the remote South Atlantic island of St. Helena, was likely born in 1832 — but he may be more than 200 years old since the exact date of his birth remains unknown.  Although blind and lacking a sense of smell, Jonathan still has sharp hearing for his advanced age and sunbathes during mild weather.  But even though giant tortoises are known for their exceptionally long lives, they may be outranked by an elusive creature of the deep.  Ocean secrets  A Greenland shark is seen swimming beneath the ice near northern Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. Avalon.red/Alamy Stock Photo  The rarely seen Greenland shark is a sluggish creature, slowly swimming through the deep waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The polar fish is the only species of shark that can withstand the freezing temperatures year-round.  The large sharks also live to be more than 400 years old, and some of them may have been alive since colonial times.  After mapping and studying their extraordinary genomes, scientists think the sharks’ unusually long lifespans are rooted in their unique genetic makeup — with insights that could be used to extend human lifespans.  Other worlds  The “Black Beauty” meteorite opened a window into studying ancient Mars when it was found in the Sahara Desert in 2011.  Astronomers believe the space rock was ejected from the Martian surface 5 million to 10 million years ago. And now, a single mineral grain inside the meteorite has revealed the oldest direct evidence of water on Mars 4.45 billion years ago.  The mineral grain was altered by hot water on Mars, which suggests that habitable environments such as hot springs may have existed on the red planet early in its history.  Meanwhile, the Perseverance rover just completed its 3 ½-month ascent up the steep rim of Jezero Crater on Mars, spotting an unusual zebra-striped rock along the way. Next up? The robotic explorer will investigate the oldest rocks on Mars to uncover more about the planet’s mysterious past.  Wild kingdom  A monarch butterfly drinks nectar from a flower in the pollinator habitat bed near the Chicago Park District storehouse in August. Tess Crowley/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images  With distinctive orange-and-black wings, monarch butterflies are easy to spot as they flit among the flowers, helping pollinate plants and encouraging biodiversity.  But monarch populations have seen a steep decline due to insecticides, habitat loss and the climate crisis — troubling enough that the US Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed adding the fragile species to the threatened species list.  If the butterflies receive the designation, more action could be taken to protect the important pollinators. But officials warn that without action, monarchs could vanish before the end of the century with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems.  Fantastic creatures  When a creature washed ashore in New Zealand in July, experts wondered whether it might be a spade-toothed whale, the world’s rarest whale that’s considered to be almost mythical because it has never been seen alive at sea.  Now, scientists studying the remains have confirmed the “really stocky, powerful-looking little animal” is indeed one of the elusive marine mammals, said Anton van Helden, an expert on some of the world’s rarest whales.  The carcass, studied by whale scientists and members of the local Māori community, yielded precious clues about the deep-sea-diving animal.  We are family  An illustration depicts early Europeans who lived in what's now Ranis, Germany, around 45,000 years ago and likely traveled together across the open steppe landscape. Tom Björklund/Max Planck Institute  Ancient DNA retrieved from bone fragments found in a cave beneath a medieval castle have helped scientists pinpoint when prehistoric humans encountered Neanderthals and made babies with them.  The bones belonged to a mother, daughter and distant cousins who lived in what’s now eastern Germany about 45,000 years ago. Their genomes revealed evidence of Neanderthal ancestry, meaning that early Homo sapiens living in the region mated with Neanderthals 1,500 years earlier.  “We were far more similar than we were different,” said Priya Moorjani, assistant professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley.  “They seem to have mixed with each other for a long period of time.”  In addition to shedding light on the shared history between humans and Neanderthals, the study also showed that the fragments belonged to a lost branch of the human family tree.

Police were called to a bar in Victoria in central London – a short walk from the palace – on Tuesday evening when a festive celebration turned violent.  A 24-year-old woman, who has not been identified, was arrested on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and of being drunk and disorderly, London’s Metropolitan Police told CNN.  The woman, who subsequently spent Tuesday night and much of the following day in a police cell, is believed to be a maid at the palace and was on a night out with around 50 members of palace staff at the time, according to The Sun newspaper.

She reportedly smashed some glasses and turned on a member of the bar staff.  Management at the royal residence say the matter is now being investigated and that disciplinary action could follow.  A palace spokesperson told the BBC: “We are aware of an incident outside the workplace involving a number of Household staff who had previously attended an early evening reception at the Palace.  “While this was an informal social gathering, not an official Palace Christmas party, the facts will be fully investigated, with a robust disciplinary process followed in relation to individual staff and appropriate action taken.”  The spokesperson told the BBC that the post-reception drinks, which staff went on to at the bar, were informal and had not been arranged by the palace.  A palace spokesperson confirmed the statement to CNN.  A spokesperson for London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed the incident to CNN in an email, saying: “At 21:21hrs on Tuesday, 10 December officers were called to a bar in Victoria Street, SW1 following reports that a customer had smashed glasses and attempted to assault a member of staff.  “Officers attended and arrested a 24-year-old woman on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly.  “She was taken into custody and released the following evening having been given a penalty notice for disorder.”"
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/world/israel-syria-golan-mount-hermon/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Why Israel captured Syria’s tallest mountain just hours after Assad fell,"CNN —  Israel wasted no time after Bashar al-Assad’s fall to bomb all the Syrian military assets it wanted to keep out of the rebels’ hands – striking nearly 500 targets, destroying the navy, and taking out, it claims, 90% of Syria’s known surface-to-air missiles.  But it is Israel’s capture of Syria’s highest peak, the Mount Hermon summit, that may prove among the most lasting prizes – though officials have insisted that its occupation is temporary.  “This is the highest place in the region, looking upon Lebanon, upon Syria, Israel,” said Efraim Inbar, director of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS). “It’s strategically extremely important. There is no substitute for mountains.”  Israeli armored vehicles at the demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights. Matias Delacroix/AP  The summit of Mount Hermon lies in Syria, in a buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces for fifty years until last weekend, when Israeli troops took control of it. Until Sunday, the summit was demilitarized and patrolled by UN peacekeepers – their highest permanent position in the world.  Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, on Friday ordered the military to prepare for the harsh conditions of winter deployment. “Due to developments in Syria, it is of immense security importance to maintain our control over the summit of Mount Hermon,” he said in a statement.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has advanced beyond the summit, as far as Beqaasem, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Syrian capital, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. CNN could not independently confirm that claim. An Israeli military spokesperson this week denied that forces were “advancing toward” Damascus.  Israeli artillery on Mount Hermon in 1974. Alain Dejean/Sygma/Getty Images  Israel captured the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau in southwestern Syria that abuts Mount Hermon, in the 1967 war and has occupied it since. Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981. The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration.  Israel has for decades held some lower slopes of Mount Hermon, and even operates a ski resort there, but the peak remained in Syria proper.  “We have no intention to intervene in Syria’s internal affairs,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video days after Israel bombed hundreds of Syrian targets and seized the demilitarized buffer zone. “But we certainly intend to do everything necessary to take care of our security.”  Mount Hermon’s summit is a tremendous asset under Israel’s control. At 9,232 feet (2,814 meters), it is higher than any point in Syria or Israel, and second to only one peak in Lebanon.  “People sometimes say in the age of missiles, land is not important – it’s simply untrue,” Inbar said.  In an academic paper published in 2011, he wrote of the many advantages presented by Mount Hermon.  “It enables the use of electronic surveillance deep into Syrian territory, giving Israel early-warning capacity in case of an impending attack,” he wrote. Advanced technological alternatives like airborne surveillance, he argued, was simply not comparable. “In contrast to an installation on a mountain, these cannot carry heavy equipment such as big antennas, and they can be shot down by anti-air missiles.”  Israeli military forces on Mount Hermon on Sunday. Social Media  The peak is just over 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) from Damascus, which means that control of its Syrian foothills – also now in IDF hands – put the Syrian capital within range for artillery cannons.  The Israeli prime minister has said his “hand is extended” to the new government in Syria. But in the post-October 7 world, he and other national security heavyweights have made clear they are not going to take any chances.  “Mostly, it’s a comfort for us,” retired Brigadier General Israel Ziv said of Israel’s operations in Syria. “We have learned what happened in other countries when you have a terror organization that captures military equipment.”  Netanyahu has also insisted that the occupation is temporary. “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7 style attacks,” he said. His criteria for withdrawing, he said, was a Syrian force “that is committed to the 1974 agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed.”  It is unclear when that may be achieved.  Whether the military withdraws “is a political decision,” Inbar said. “The military would love to stay there.”  Mike Schwartz and Tim Lister contributed to this report."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/middleeast/can-islamist-rebels-govern-syria-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Can Syria’s Islamist rebels govern the country? Their rule in Idlib offers clues,"CNN —  When Syria’s rebel-appointed prime minister sat down with officials from the ousted Assad regime for the first time on Tuesday, the backdrop included the flag of the Syrian revolution alongside another bearing the Islamic declaration of faith that is often displayed by jihadists.  The choice of optics for the rebels’ first publicized cabinet meeting to discuss the transition of power since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime sparked controversy, with sceptics taking to social media to criticize the move.  The rebels may have taken note. In a later televised interview with Al Jazeera, caretaker Prime Minister Mohammad Al Bashir, who until this week ruled the small, conservative province of Idlib on the rebels’ behalf, appeared only with the new Syrian flag.  How the rebels governed Idlib, in northwest Syria, offers insight into how they might rule the country. Experts and residents of Idlib describe their governance as pragmatic and influenced by both internal and external pressure, with efforts to distance themselves from a jihadist past and gain international acceptance. However, their rule was far from democratic or liberal. Governing a large, diverse nation like Syria, they warn, will be an entirely different challenge.  Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that led the rebel offensive to topple the Assad regime and is proscribed as a terrorist organization by the United States, has opted to rule from the shadows. Jolani, who now uses his real name Ahmad al-Sharaa, picked a technocrat – Bashir – to lead Syria in the interim. He has said his officials gained valuable experience while governing Idlib but acknowledged that may not be enough.  “They (rebels) started from nothing, Idlib is small and without resources but thank God we were able to do really good things in the past… their experience is not zero and there are (areas) they were successful in,” Jolani told Mohammed Jalali, Assad’s prime minister, in a meeting on Monday to discuss the transfer of power. “However, we cannot do without the old (guard) and we have to benefit from them.”  Syrian caretaker Prime Minister Mohamed al-Bashir attends a meeting with the transitional cabinet after Syrian rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday. AL ARABIYA TV/Reuters  In just 13 days, Jolani’s ministers went from ruling the small province of Idlib to aspiring to govern Syria following its first regime change in six decades. Experts and residents who lived under the rebel-led Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) say the inexperienced cabinet will need to significantly adapt if they are to lead the transitional period effectively.  Dr. Walid Tamer, a resident of Idlib who witnessed the province’s transformation under rebel rule and said he personally interacted with Jolani, commended the SSG’s governance in Idlib, saying freedom of expression was protected. But he cautioned that the rebels aren’t prepared to rule the rest of the country.  “You went from governing Idlib to governing an entire nation… I don’t think the capabilities of the government we saw are enough for the task of governing the whole of Syria,” said Tamer, the head of northern Syria’s Free Doctors Union who describes himself as a liberal.  Idlib was “very safe” under the SSG, he said, adding that the rebels placed no restrictions on travel and movement inside the HTS-controlled province.  “Syria as a whole was a difficult place to live in, but the (SSG) never interfered in your personal life. Products were available and no limitations were imposed on your clothing or how you lived your life,” he said.  Life in the province was not one of prosperity, however. Abdel Latif Zakoor, a resident of Idlib who lived under rebel rule but has now moved to Turkey, told CNN the economic conditions under the SSG were “very difficult.”  “There wasn’t enough work, and a lot of people just stayed at home,” he said.  Taking control  When Jolani expanded his influence in Idlib in 2017, he eliminated rival Islamist groups and backed a new project to install a civilian government made up of local technocrats and academics, breaking from other jihadist methods that saw religious coercion under the rule of the sword in territories they captured.  “Before the Salvation Government you had many different factions that had their own courts of justice, prisons and social services,” Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst who has researched HTS for the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think tank, told CNN. “It imposed itself on other factions and took out their governing responsibilities.”  Displaced Syrians arrive from Lebanon to Idlib on October 10. In the center of the picture, the minister of interior in the Syrian Salvation Government, affiliated with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Muhammad Abd al-Rahman, appears as he inspects the registration procedures for displaced Syrians fleeing Lebanon. Ghaith Alsayed/Getty Images  Upon its establishment in 2017, the SSG issued a communique outlining four principles, one of which was that Islamic Sharia law is the “sole source of legislation,” emphasizing the need to “maintain the people’s Syrian and Islamic identity,” Al Jazeera reported.  The SSG operated as a functional government, holding publicized cabinet meetings with suited officials, issuing press statements and overseeing eleven ministries, including justice, sports, and education. It collected taxes, managed Idlib’s limited resources to govern 4 million people, and coordinated with international humanitarian groups to deliver aid to the 3 million displaced people in the region.  But the government wasn’t democratically elected, with ministers appointed through the approval of the shura, or consultative council, made up of prominent local figures, some of whom were selected by Jolani’s HTS. No women served in SSG leadership positions during its seven years of rule.  “It’s an Islamic governance in a technocratic way. What they wanted to do is control how religion is understood and how it’s implemented,” said Drevon.  A United Nations report from 2022 painted a grim picture of what life under HTS’ leadership was like.  “People were detained following comments made in private conversations pertaining to the cost of living or religious matters,” the UN Human Rights Council report on Syria said. “These comments were qualified as slander and blasphemy, with the latter leading to a sentence of one year of imprisonment.” Authorities “continued to arrest women for being ‘inappropriately’ dressed, and for non-compliance with entertainment-related bans.”  Tamer, who said he negotiated with HTS and SSG officials over medical matters, said that over the years, Jolani took a back seat in the daily affairs of the government and gave it more agency, only intervening on larger issues that endangered his group’s influence.  Rule by decree  Lacking a constitution or an elected legislature, the rebels ruled Idlib by decree, setting up a hybrid civil-Islamic court structure that included defense lawyers, a prosecutor and an appeals process.  Jolani was pragmatic in adapting to the requirements of the society he ruled over, Drevon said. Responding to the public’s displeasure, he slowly phased out the strict application of Islamic law, turned a blind eye to gender mixing and smoking and allowed protests against him. A Sharia law-based morality unit was disbanded but women were encouraged to cover their hair.  “It was a successful project in practice because there was also some buy in from the population. It was stable, the economy was working better (than the rest of Syria) and even the type of authoritarianism was nothing compared to Assad’s family,” Drevon said.  But there were exceptions. Last year, the SSG issued a “morality decree” instructing children to adhere to an Islamic dress code and limiting music in educational facilities. Jolani intervened to freeze the decree, fearing that an international uproar could affect aid donations, Drevon said.  Another issue was the arrest and alleged torture of dissidents that caused significant protests against Jolani in Idlib last year. Jolani told CNN last week that abuses in prisons “were not done under our orders or directions” and that HTS had already penalized the perpetrators.  Drevon said that Syria’s transition to democracy is going to be a lengthy and complicated process after six decades of dictatorship.  “It was a very new form of governance (in Idlib),” he said. “You can’t expect an armed group in war controlling a region that’s very tiny to create a social democratic system… They had to be realistic on what’s possible at war. Syria hasn’t had democracy in five, six decades. You will not become democratic in one week.”"

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/europe/lutsenko-ukraine-replaces-commander-russia-intl-latam/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Ukraine replaces commander following Russian advances on key city of Pokrovsk,"CNN —  The commander of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk group of forces has been replaced following Russian advances in the region, a military official said Saturday.  General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy would take over as head of the operational and tactical group, replacing General Oleksandr Lutsenko, the official told CNN.  The move comes after Lutsenko faced heavy criticism for failing to stop recent Russian advances on the key city of Pokrovsk.  Russian forces have been spotted just three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the city, according to Ukrainian mapping service DeepState.  Pokrovsk has been the site of some of the fiercest battles on the eastern front for months, as Russia attempts to close in on the city.  Lying around 11 miles from Ukraine’s Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, it is a strategic target for Moscow.  Its fall to Russian forces would mark the largest setback for Ukraine in months and compound Ukraine’s struggles to get off the backfoot while Russian troops pile severe pressure on the eastern front lines.  Losing it would also add to the anxiety Ukraine’s military faces over the looming Donald Trump presidency in the United States, which has raised the risk that military aid from Kyiv’s largest source could dry up as the grinding conflict approaches its fourth year.  Elsewhere in the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that Moscow’s forces had begun to deploy a “significant” number of North Korean soldiers in its effort to drive Ukraine’s army out of Russia’s Kursk region.  Ukraine launched an incursion into Kursk in August and still retains some settlements there.  “Today, there is already preliminary evidence that the Russians have begun to use soldiers from North Korea in assaults – a significant number of them,” Zelensky said.  “The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in the Kursk region,” Zelensky said, adding there had already been “noticeable” losses among these soldiers.  He added that Ukraine had information that North Korean soldiers may be being used along other parts of the front line."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/asia/south-korea-yoon-second-impeachment-hnk-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,South Korea’s parliament votes to impeach president over martial law debacle,"Seoul, South Korea CNN —  South Korea’s parliament voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday in an extraordinary rebuke that came about after his own ruling party turned on him following his refusal to resign over his short-lived martial law attempt.  It is the second time in less than a decade that a South Korean leader has faced impeachment proceedings in office and means Yoon is suspended from exercising his powers until the decision is finally adjudicated by the country’s Constitutional Court.  Following the vote, which sparked jubilation among protesters outside parliament, Yoon conceded that he will “stop temporarily for now, but the journey to the future that I’ve walked with the people for the past two years should not stop.”  “I will not give up,” he said in a statement shared by the country’s presidential office.  “With all the encouragement and support for me in mind, I will do my best until the last moment for the nation,” he added.  The country’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who will serve as acting president under South Korean law, told reporters that he would “devote all my strength and effort to stable operation of state affairs.”  Kang Sun-woo, a lawmaker with the Democratic Party, told CNN Saturday that the “great democracy of South Korea will survive and will be born again” after the impeachment.  The dramatic decision marks the culmination of a stunning political showdown after Yoon briefly declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers to parliament, where lawmakers fought past troops to enter the building and vote down the decree.  Yoon’s gamble backfired spectacularly, galvanizing many in the vibrant Asian democracy to call for his removal.  Opposition parties tried impeaching him a week ago – but Yoon survived after members of his ruling People Power Party boycotted the vote, saying they hoped the president would voluntarily resign instead.  Yoon then doubled down – giving a defiant speech on Thursday in which he defended his martial law decision, lambasted the opposition, claimed he was trying to save the country and vowed to “fight until the last moment with the people.”  Yet moments before that speech, the leader of Yoon’s party withdrew his support for the president and backed impeachment as the “only way… to defend democracy”, instructing lawmakers to vote with their conscience.  Thousands of protesters gathered in Seoul on Saturday, braving the cold to call for Yoon to resign ahead of the vote, which was passed by 204 lawmakers with 85 voting against it.  “He surely tried to have a war against the citizens so this is just what he deserved,” one protestor, Lim Dong Eon, told CNN outside the National Assembly building after the vote, where protesting has now turned into partying.  Another protestor kept their message short, telling CNN: “Democracy is back!”  Protesters participate in a rally calling for Yoon's impeachment in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14.

Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters  Meanwhile, thousands of the president’s supporters gathered in downtown Seoul, with many waving US and South Korean flags, chanting slogans and holding up signs in support of the embattled Yoon.  Yoon, who has been immediately suspended of his powers, now awaits a ruling by the Constitutional Court – one of the country’s highest courts – to confirm his fate, which can take up to six months.  Acting chief justice of the Constitutional Court, Moon Hyung-bae, said in a statement Saturday that a meeting will take place on Monday to discuss the case schedule, adding that the process will be conducted “swiftly and fairly.”  If confirmed, he will become the second South Korean president to be thrown out of office by impeachment after Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female leader.  The now acting president, Han Duck-soo, also faces his own political problems and is being investigated over his role in the martial law decision, adding to the political uncertainty in the weeks ahead.  A former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office, mired in low approval ratings and political scandals involving his wife and political appointments.  Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the Democratic Party, speaks during the plenary session for the impeachment vote at the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14 Woohae Cho/Pool/AFP/Getty Images  Since he took office in 2022 he has also faced political gridlock with an opposition-majority parliament – which prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill.  His administration cracked down what he referred to as “fake news” with police and prosecutors raiding multiple media outlets, including MBC and JTBC, as well as the homes of journalists.  Yoon argued that his frustration with the political deadlock drove him to take a bold power move, surprising not only members of his own party but also many military leaders.  Police raids and treason investigations  In his late-night address declaring martial law, Yoon accused the opposition of “anti-state” activities and being in cahoots with North Korea, without providing evidence – a charge his opponents have strenuously denied. He also portrayed his act as the only way to break the political deadlock in parliament.  But it was met with shock and anger across the country, which remains deeply scarred by the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it transitioned into hard-won democracy in the 1980s.

On Tuesday, lawmakers approved a special counsel to investigate whether Yoon committed insurrection and abused his power by issuing martial law.  The following day, South Korean police raided the presidential office, a presidential security official confirmed to CNN. Yoon has also been barred from leaving the country.  Last week, South Korean prosecutors detained former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who allegedly recommended the martial law imposition and resigned in the wake of the scandal. Kim attempted to end his own life in custody late Tuesday, according to the head of the country’s correctional service.  On Thursday, Yoon said he had only discussed the martial law decree with Kim before declaring it. Meanwhile parliament has already impeached both Yoon’s justice minister and his police chief.  Senior government officials have testified at various government hearings over the last week revealing some extraordinary details about the night of the martial law order.  Special Warfare Command Commander Kwak Jong-geun testified that he received a direct order from President Yoon to break the doors of the National Assembly and drag out the lawmakers, but he did not comply.  South Korea, one of East Asia’s most important economies and vital US regional ally, now faces months of protracted political uncertainty of the kind that dominated the country during the last impeachment crisis in 2016 and 2017.  Then-president Park Geun-hye was ultimately impeached by lawmakers over corruption allegations, kicked out of office by the Constitutional Court, jailed and later pardoned.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/entertainment/chappell-charli-sabrina-pop-cec/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,"Pop music is messier, for the better, because of Chappell Roan, Charli XCX and Sabrina Carpenter","CNN —  This year brought us new albums from some of the biggest artists in the world: Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift all put out music that thrilled fans.  And yet some of the most impactful pop music of 2024 came not from Tay or Bey, but from three rising pop stars whose songs took us out to the clubs (Pink Pony and otherwise) and back home to the bedroom. They embraced romantic ugliness and cutting self-reflection — and pushed pop forward.  The year arguably belonged to Charli XCX, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter.  “People like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, who’ve dominated for so long — they have a sheen and a polish to them that’s somewhat unrelatable as a listener,” said Sam Murphy, a music curator who analyzes and dissects pop on his popular TikTok account. “What people really craved this year, the TikTok generation, was to see more mess and chaos in people’s lives. We wanted pop stars that we were able to see the flaws within and the charisma coming out.”  The year saw Charli, a boundary-pushing yet oft-overlooked pop veteran, finally escape what the New York Times once called “pop’s middle class” with her defiant, sweat-soaked, goopy-green opus, “Brat.”  This year, Carpenter went from a supporting act on the highest-grossing tour in history to a leading lady herself, with her endearingly silly, sexy songs topping the charts. (Here’s where she’d make a sex joke.)  And it was the year when everyone wanted to take things H-O-T T-O G-O, dance in the Pink Pony Club and wish their exes good luck, babe. Roan’s debut album came out over a year ago, but it rapidly grew an audience this year as she took her act on the road and won us over.  We loved this trio of stars because they weren’t impenetrable like Beyoncé or as towering as Swift. These artists were accessible to us, interacting with fans online and touring prolifically. Their music was personal and specific, with confessional lyrics about self-hatred, unrequited love and lust.  It helps, of course, that their music is exciting and compulsively listenable, said Mike Errico, a musician and visiting assistant arts professor at New York University’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, who teaches songwriting.  “The songs are great. They’re great writers and vocalists, and they’re working with great teams,” Errico said. “ But they also have something very urgent to say.”  None of these women became stars overnight — they’ve been recording music since they were teenagers, steadily building an audience who jibed with their unique sound. Their music doesn’t reinvent pop. But by adding their unique flavors to a well-trodden genre that’s been stuck in a rut of sameness, they’re forcing it into a looser, freer future.  “It’s been a while since there’s been a changing of the guards for people at the top,” Murphy said.  Fans want authenticity — and these artists delivered  Charli XCX belts at a Denmark music festival in July. Joseph Okpako/WireImage/Getty Images  There will always be room for artists like Swift, who’s “etched a place in history that can’t be erased,” Murphy said. But her titanic popularity has led to some “fatigue” among pop fans, he said.  “I think there’s a level of polish that is really reflective of a bygone era of pop that people aren’t relating to,” Murphy said.  Part of why Charli, Roan and Carpenter are so magnetic is because their music wasn’t made for everyone. They weren’t the biggest pop stars in the world when they were writing their breakthrough albums, so they weren’t beholden to an audience of millions. They’ve each cultivated a sound so specific that it can’t be mistaken for anything else.  “The ubiquitous, all-satisfying pop star has disappeared, and instead these niches are becoming bigger and bigger,” Murphy said. “I think that’s why it worked, that push that kept so much on that niche fanbase. It became so big to the point that it was able to start penetrating the mainstream conversation.”  Mainstream, indeed. Some of the biggest songs of the year were made by this pop trifecta. “Espresso,” especially, was inescapable, as Spotify’s most-streamed song globally with over 1.6 billion plays. “Good Luck, Babe!” also scored over one billion streams, and it was Roan’s only new single of the year.  The craving for authentic pop stars reminds Murphy of the “transition from Instagram to TikTok, where your Instagram feed was all about being polished and showing the incredible life that you were leading, even if things were really falling apart behind the scenes.”  On TikTok, meanwhile, users approach their content with inspiring candor, sharing their lives, warts and all, he said.  Charli, Roan and Carpenter take the same approach to their music. Their respective breakout albums, “Brat,” “The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess” and “Short n’ Sweet,” are all deeply personal, vibrant and, crucially, danceable records. That their voices or hearts might break along the way only adds to their considerable charms.  Works from established artists who have a quality and reputation to uphold, like Grande’s “Eternal Sunshine” or Lipa’s “Radical Optimism” — even “Cowboy Carter” and “The Tortured Poets Department,” which are both nominated for album of the year at the Grammys — ”all just got blown out of the water by these moments that felt more exciting,” Murphy said.  Live performances going viral helped artists like Chappell become stars  TikTok virality can turn a song into a hit, but it’s the art of performance that turns an artist into a star.  “I don’t think what happened to Chappell this year (would have) happened without her live stage presence,” Murphy said.  Roan cut her teeth on Olivia Rodrigo’s “Guts” tour earlier this year before joining the lineups of spring and summer musical festivals. We watched as her star rose steadily with every performance: In April, a clip of Roan performing the bridge of “Good Luck, Babe!” dressed in sleazy latex and leather at Coachella won new fans who went back and discovered her debut album. Four months later, at Lollapalooza, she played to the largest crowd in the festival’s history — organizers said as many as 110,000 people may’ve been in her audience.  Chappell Roan, pictured performing in Tennessee in October, had a busy touring schedule this year. With every tour stop, her audience grew. Jason Kempin/Getty Images  “We were watching that growth in real time, in tandem with incredible presentations of her music live,” Murphy said. “It’s difficult to imagine that kind of thing happening even five years ago, pre-pandemic.”  Carpenter’s trajectory was similar, supporting Swift on the Eras Tour before making some festival stops on her own and releasing the smash that introduced us all to the nonsensical phrase “that me espresso.”  These artists are meeting audiences where they’re at, which is, overwhelmingly, on TikTok. Charli and Chappell regularly connect with their fans on the platform, candidly delivering news directly to followers in a video instead of a manager-approved statement.  They also shirk the traditional promotional model of aiming for radio play to grow their fanbases, said music writer Reanna Cruz, who’s written for New York magazine, Rolling Stone and NPR. Now, radio is trying to play catch-up with the young fans it used to influence.  “We’re seeing younger artists that know how to access those hyper-online audiences more effectively have more success,” Cruz said.  We’re living the adjustment to mega-fame with the stars, too. Charli took a victory lap with the remix album “Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat,” on which she warped her original songs into meditations on sudden superstardom. Roan’s public grappling with invasions of privacy sparked conversations about how much stars owe their fans. And clips from Carpenter’s tour routinely go viral, most recently when Marcello Hernandez of “Saturday Night Live” stopped by, in character, as doctor-model-loverboy Domingo.  They have clear POVs that speaks to our time  Over the last decade, hip-hop has reigned as the most popular genre, Cruz and Murphy said, where innovation thrived and stars were reliably discovered. Until this year, pop, with a few exceptions, had been stuck in a rut.  The genre has been suffering from sameness throughout the back-half of the 2010s and into the 2020s, when many artists tried to appeal to all kinds of listeners without carving out their own recognizable sound. There was still room for breakouts like Lipa, Rodrigo and Billie Eilish, plus artists that blended pop and hip-hop, like Doja Cat and SZA, but pop was overwhelmingly plagued by monotony.  Enter Charli, Roan and Carpenter. While their sounds are clearly influenced by earlier acts — “Good Luck, Babe!” builds to a Kate Bush-style bridge; Carpenter’s latest album borrows from Shania Twain and Grande in parts; and Charli has mentioned electronic pioneers like Sophie and titans like Lou Reed and Daft Punk in “Brat” press — it’s their approach to the genre whose rules and boundaries are well-known that make them such exciting artists.  The artists make few compromises in their music. Charli’s beats are tailor-made for the club, with lyrics vacillating between braggadocious bombast to reflections on grief and insecurity. (“Nowadays I only eat at the good restaurants, but honestly I’m always thinkin’ ‘bout my weight,” she sings in “Rewind.”)  Roan’s campy, drag-inspired musical aesthetic has drawn more than a few comparisons to Lady Gaga’s similarly theatrical sound. It lends itself well to songs about hooking up with and falling hard for other women — still a rarity in mainstream pop. (“She did it right there, out on the deck — put her canine teeth in the side of my neck,” goes the first verse of “Red Wine Supernova.”)  Carpenter stuffs a dozen double entendres and innuendos into each deliriously raunchy song on “Short n’ Sweet.” And then sometimes, she drops the artifice and just says what she means: “I’m so f**king horny!” Here’s a pop star plainly confessing and celebrating her lust, something artists like Madonna were once lambasted for. Flirting with cheeky controversy, as with Madonna, has only boosted her profile.  Sabrina Carpenter, pictured at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, has won fans over with her retro pop sensibility and raunchy lyrics. Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty Images  Their music isn’t necessarily political, though Charli, who’s British, famously waded into the conversation when she posted, “kamala IS brat” shortly after the vice president’s candidacy in the US presidential election was announced. But the candid, confident music these pop stars make is meaningful during this turbulent moment, Errico said.  Songs like Charli’s “I think about it all the time,” in which the avowed party girl weighs motherhood, Roan’s various queer love songs and even Carpenter’s lusty, lightweight “Juno,” take on a new gravity at a time when, in the US, bodily autonomy for women and LGBTQ people is fraught and uncertain, Errico said.  “I think they’re sensing the clock turning back, and coming up with hooky, clever ways to say, ‘Over my dead body,’” Errico said. “They’re building a new army for a newly perilous time, while also having a blast.”  The future of pop, Murphy says, is tipping toward honest excess. We saw it this year with Charli transforming massive arenas into sweaty clubs, Roan painting herself with the patina of the Statue of Liberty, Carpenter enraging pearl-clutchers by striking provocative poses on tour. None of the over-the-top flourishes would work, though, without confessional bangers that both transport and ring true.  “People sometimes joke that we’re living in ‘the worst timeline,’ but these artists are determined to throw the best party anyone’s ever tried to shut down,” Errico said."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/federal-government-workers-what-matters/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,How many people work for the federal government?,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.  CNN —  The US grew a lot in the past 40 years.  The US population expanded by about 100 million people  One of them was Vivek Ramaswamy, who was born in 1985 and is one of two wealthy men tasked by President-elect Donald Trump with shrinking the size of the federal government.  Government spending skyrocketed  The US spent around $900 billion in 1984 ($2.7 trillion in 2024 dollars), compared with more than $7 trillion in 2024. Some of that money goes via contracts to Elon Musk, the world’s richest man who is working with Ramaswamy on the Department of Government Efficiency, a new nongovernmental commission.  The national debt has more than exploded  It went from less than $1.6 trillion in 1984 ($4.8 trillion in 2024 dollars) to more than $35.5 trillion today, which should concern every American and is plenty of reason to make any effort to control federal spending a serious and bipartisan push.  Cut federal workers?  The current effort, run by Ramaswamy and Musk, has made a show of eyeing the size of the federal workforce. One percolating idea, according to CNN’s reporting, is that they could recommend firing every federal worker hired in the last year.  Hold on a sec  In those 40 years of explosive population, spending and debt growth, the size of the federal workforce – this is actually kind of shocking – has stayed pretty much the same, confounding the popular presumption that the number of federal workers must have skyrocketed with federal spending.  “The number of federal employees have skyrocketed over the past four years, especially the number that are working from home and not even coming to work,” the House Oversight Committee chairman, Rep. James Comer, told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Thursday, expressing that view.  A closer look at available data shows a variation of a few hundred thousand workers – which seems large but is not a grand expansion of the federal workforce.  Close to 3 million federal civilian workers for decades  There were about 2.96 million civilians, including postal workers, getting full-time paychecks from the federal government at the end of 1984, before Ramaswamy was born, and there are a hair over 3 million working for the federal government today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The official tally from the Office of Personnel Management is a smidge lower, at about 2.87 million, including postal workers.  In fact, the number of full-time federal workers has been relatively static, within a few hundred thousand civilians, since the 1960s.  Even a drawdown of the size of the military and Pentagon during the George H.W. Bush administration and of the federal workforce by hundreds of thousands during the Clinton administration did not markedly change the size of the federal workforce, which has hovered within a few hundred thousand of 3 million workers for decades.  Hundreds of thousands in, hundreds of thousands out every year  Of people who come into and go out of the federal workforce each year, there were hundreds of thousands of civilian employees (not counting postal workers) – about 250,000 to just over 300,000 – newly hired by the federal government in each of the past three years. Those are largely offset by the hundreds of thousands of civilian employees who leave the civil service each year.  Peter Morrissey is the senior director of talent and strategy at The Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for improvements to public service and commissioned a 2017 study to determine the true size of government.  “When you think about the long sweep of it, the number of public servants – people with a .gov email who work for the federal government – has been basically static as the responsibility sets have grown and grown and grown and grown and grown,” he told me. “They serve more people, and they do more stuff.”  Rising costs of social programs like Social Security and Medicare, along with rising costs of material goods, have helped drive government spending.  “People are an absolutely essential part, but in terms of the cost structure, are a comparatively small part,” he said.  In some agencies that Republicans have said they want to shutter, there are relatively few employees – such as the smallest Cabinet-level agency, the Department of Education. It employs about 4,400 employees, according to OPM. The largest federal agencies, like Veterans Affairs and the Pentagon, employ hundreds of thousands of workers.  Most federal workers are not in the DC area  Another thing to know about the federal workforce is that while its largest concentration is in the Washington, DC, metro area, the vast majority, 80%, is spread around the country in every state, but with concentrations in California, Texas, Colorado, Alabama and other states.  Concentrating on improving government might not mean shrinking it, according to Jenny Mattingley, vice president of government affairs at the Partnership for Public Service, which advocates for smarter government.  “What we keep trying to pivot the conversation to is say, let’s make sure we’re fixing government in a way that doesn’t hurt service delivery and doesn’t hurt the American public in terms of getting the things from agencies that they depend on,” she said.  ‘Giant holding company’  The government does indeed do many things. Elaine Kamarck is founding director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, and she helped spearhead an effort to reduce the size of government during the Clinton administration.  She told me it’s important not to view the US government as one monolithic thing, but rather as “essentially a giant holding company.”  “It’s doing everything from training pilots to fly advanced aircraft to tracking down cryptosporidium in your hamburger meat to cutting checks for retired people,” she said.  Firing only the most recent hires, as may be suggested by Musk and Ramaswamy, would have the added impact of scaring away future hires, as well as displacing people hired for specific roles, such as to implement the bipartisan infrastructure law passed during the Biden administration.  Once funded, agencies never go away  But Comer said people hired for specific roles and programs funded once have a tendency to stick around.  “The problem now in government, it’s been the problem for decades … is that you create a government program or create a government agency, it never goes away, even when it becomes obsolete or inefficient,” Comer told Brown on CNN.  The real deep state  On the one hand, the use of contractors and grant employees has risen as those workers, who don’t get a paycheck directly from the government but still do government work, have shouldered more of the burden.  John DiIulio, who worked in both the Barack Obama and George W. Bush administrations, wrote recently that the intersecting system of companies and local officials clamoring for federal dollars represents their own form of a deep state, and deconstructing it will be, he wrote, way harder than rocket science. Here’s an excerpt of what DiIulio wrote:  The citizens of the real deep state stoke nonstop federal deficit spending on everything from Medicare to missiles. They steer funding through intentionally maze-like federal programs. They use federal tax dollars to privately employ millions of people. They are behind the ‘waste, fraud, and abuse’ that everyone typically blames on ‘bureaucrats’ who are mostly mere grant and contract managers in a workforce that has not grown since the 1960s.  Musk, who has built companies on government contracts and subsidies, may be able to offer some insight into how the system works.  How many people actually work for the government, including contractors?  That review of “The True Size of Government” conducted for The Volcker Alliance by researcher Paul Light determined that in 1984, there were more than 6.9 million people working as civilians for the federal government when including contractors and grant employees. Add in the military and postal workers and the figure jumped to 9.8 million.  Intervening years saw a drawdown in the military after the Cold War and then a buildup during the Global War on terror. The study concluded with data from 2015, when there was a total of 9.1 million workers, or 7.3 million without the military or postal service.  Certainly the figure of contract and grant employees must have grown along with major spending bills in the past few years – with the infrastructure bill, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, which earmarked billions to transition the US to a greener economy. Comer said Musk and Ramaswamy, who will take a year and a half to make recommendations, could recommend trying to claw back unspent funds.  “There has been some pressure over years to not increase head count, and that usually leads to greater contracting,” Morrissey said, although there’s evidence that contractors frequently end up costing the government more money.  Everyone I talked to for this story agrees there is plenty of room for bipartisanship in a government efficiency effort to modernize the workforce and improve the way the federal government functions. Both Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Musk have talked about the need to control Pentagon spending, for instance. One complication for Musk will be that his firm SpaceX, in particular, is the recipient of billions in contracts."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process that would have the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items that may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/health/unitedhealth-children-autism-propublica/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,UnitedHealth is strategically limiting access to critical treatment for kids with autism,"This story was originally published by ProPublica.  ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive its biggest stories as soon as they’re published.  There was a time when Sharelle Menard thought her son would never be able to speak. She couldn’t soothe Benji when he cried, couldn’t read him books he could follow, couldn’t take him out in public. “The screaming, and screaming, and screaming,” she said. “He would get so frustrated because he couldn’t communicate.”  Benji was nearly 3 when he was diagnosed with severe autism and soon after started a specialized therapy to help him develop basic skills. After two years in treatment, his murmuring gave way to small words, with “bubbles” among the first. To celebrate, Menard powered up a bubble machine she found at the dollar store, and for hours, they watched the iridescent orbs drift over their porch.  Menard, who is raising Benji alone in south-central Louisiana, began to picture a future for her son that diverged from the stories she’d heard about some kids with similar diagnoses, who grew up still unable to manage their frustrations and had to live in nursing homes or institutions.  But now, she’s worried again.  The insurer that has been paying for her son’s therapy, UnitedHealthcare, has begun — to the befuddlement of his clinical team — denying him the hours they say he requires to maintain his progress. Inside the insurance conglomerate, the nation’s largest and most profitable, the slashing of care to children like Benji does have a reason, though it has little to do with their needs. It is part of a secret internal cost-cutting campaign that targets a growing financial burden for the company: the treatment of thousands of children with autism across the country.  ProPublica has obtained what is effectively the company’s strategic playbook, developed by Optum, the division that manages mental health benefits for United. In internal reports, the company acknowledges that the therapy, called applied behavior analysis, is the “evidence-based gold standard treatment for those with medically necessary needs.” But the company’s costs have climbed as the number of children diagnosed with autism has ballooned; experts say greater awareness and improved screening have contributed to a fourfold increase in the past two decades — from 1 in 150 to 1 in 36.  So Optum is “pursuing market-specific action plans” to limit children’s access to the treatment, the reports said.  “Key opportunities” are outlined in bullets in the documents. While acknowledging some areas have “very long waitlists” for the therapy, the company said it aims to “prevent new providers from joining the network” and “terminate” existing ones, including “cost outliers.” If an insurer drops a provider from its network, patients may have to find a new clinician that accepts their insurance or pay up to tens of thousands of dollars a year out of pocket for the therapy. The company has calculated that, in some states, this reduction could impact more than two-fifths of its ABA therapy provider groups in network and up to 19% of its patients in therapy.  Internal company documents reveal the strategy by Optum, a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary, to prevent ABA providers from participating in its network. Obtained by ProPublica  The strategy targets kids covered through the company’s state-contracted Medicaid plans, funded by the government for the nation’s poorest and most vulnerable patients. To manage Medicaid benefits, states often pay private insurers a fixed amount of funds per patient, regardless of the frequency or intensity of services used. When companies spend less than the allotted payment, they are typically allowed to keep some or all of what remains, which federal investigators and experts acknowledge may be incentivizing insurers to limit care.  United administers Medicaid plans or benefits in about two dozen states and for more than 6 million people, including nearly 10,000 children with autism spectrum disorder. Optum expects to spend about $290 million for ABA therapy within its Medicaid plans this year, and it anticipates the need increasing, documents show. The number of its Medicaid patients accessing the specialized therapy has increased by about 20% over the past year, with expenses rising about $75 million year-on-year.  So Optum — whose parent company, UnitedHealth Group, earned $22 billion in net profits last year — is “heavily investing” in its plan to save millions by limiting access to such care.  In addition to culling providers from its network, the company is scrutinizing the medical necessity of the therapy for individual patients with “rigorous” clinical reviews, which can lead to denials of covered treatment. Optum has developed an “approach to authorizing less units than requested,” the records state.  Internal company documents reveal Optum is deploying “rigorous utilization management” in response to an increased need for ABA therapy. Obtained by ProPublica  Mental health and autism experts and advocates reviewed ProPublica’s findings and expressed outrage over the company’s strategy. Karen Fessel, whose Mental Health and Autism Insurance Project helps families access care, called the tactics “unconscionable and immoral.”  “They’re denying access to treatment and shrinking a network at a time when they clearly know that there is an urgent need,” she said.  United and Optum declined a request ProPublica made more than a month ago for an on-the-record interview about their coverage of behavioral health care. They have not answered questions emailed 11 days ago, citing the Dec. 4 killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO as the reason. In an email, a spokesperson said “we are in mourning” and could not engage with a “non-urgent story during this incredibly difficult moment in time.” Offered an additional day or two, the company would not agree to a deadline for comment.  Benji, who is now 10, requires 33 hours of weekly therapy to be able to progress, his therapists have concluded. They have documented the consequences of having even a few hours less: toppled furniture, scratched-up classroom aides, a kid in unremitting tears, unable to learn. But in a letter to Menard, Optum said it was refusing to pay for the full hours, stating that her son had been in therapy for too long and was not showing enough progress to ultimately graduate from it.  “Your child still has a lot of difficulty with all autism-related needs,” Optum wrote. “Your child still needs help, but it does not appear that your child will improve enough to end ABA.”  The response confounded experts who spoke with ProPublica, who said such an approach misunderstands the long-term nature of his condition. “Challenges that often come with autism shouldn’t be looked at like an injury that you’re going to get better from quickly and then the treatment can stop,” said Christa Stevens, who directs state government affairs for the advocacy group Autism Speaks. “Treatment may still be medically necessary even if it’s for skill maintenance or the prevention of regression.”  The company’s denial also appears to contrast with recent professional guidelines for the therapy — which are cited as a reference in Optum’s own clinical criteria — that state “there is no specific limit on the duration of a course of treatment.”  The appropriate duration of treatment, according to those standards and experts interviewed by ProPublica, should be based on the patients’ needs, as evaluated by the clinicians working directly with the patients.  “This is a very blunt instrument to chase after excessive costs,” said Tim Clement, the vice president of federal government affairs at the nonprofit group Mental Health America.  Several advocates told ProPublica the company’s strategy is legally questionable.  The federal mental health parity law requires insurers to provide the same access to mental health and physical care. As ProPublica recently reported, United has gotten in trouble in the past for targeting therapy coverage in a way that violates the law; while denying the allegations, it agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement. It continues to use arbitrary and one-size-fits-all thresholds to scrutinize its therapy claims, ProPublica previously found.  It would raise legal questions if the company restricted ABA more stringently than comparable physical care, the advocates said.  “Medicaid managed care organizations are subject to the parity act,” said Deborah Steinberg, a senior health policy attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Legal Action Center. The company may be violating Medicaid regulations, she said, which require managed care organizations to maintain networks sufficient to provide covered services to all enrollees.  Last year, the federal government formally affirmed that ABA therapy is a protected benefit, and it recently investigated health plans for entirely excluding its coverage; legislators have passed laws in every state requiring insurance companies to pay for it.  “Yes, this therapy can be expensive,” said Dan Unumb, an attorney and president of the Autism Legal Resource Center. “But solving the problem by denying kids access to medically necessary care is a terrible solution.”  ‘What happens if we withdraw the care?’  Benji dances with his behavior analyst, Whitney Newton, at Aspire Behavioral Health Center in Lafayette. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  Benji was making progress about three years ago.  For more than 33 hours a week in the specialized therapy, his clinicians broke down the learning process into basic steps, using repetition and positive reinforcement to affirm behaviors. The state’s Medicaid contractor, UnitedHealthcare, covered the bill.  Researchers have found that about a quarter of kids diagnosed with autism are severely affected; these children are often minimally or non-speaking or require extensive assistance for basic daily needs. “Things a lot of people take for granted,” said Menard. While experts continue to debate which therapies are most effective and appropriate for these kids, ABA is one of the most widely recommended.  By 7, Benji had accumulated a few dozen words, and his aggressive, prolonged tantrums had grown less frequent, allowing his mother to take him grocery shopping and to mass on Sundays. It was time for him to go to school, she thought.  Menard enrolled him in their public school district, St. Martin Parish. He attended Breaux Bridge Primary twice a week in a special education classroom and continued therapy the other days. Menard urged the district to allow a therapeutic technician to shadow him in school, but it refused. (The district declined to respond to ProPublica’s questions, citing privacy restrictions.)  With the diminished hours of treatment, Benji grew increasingly disruptive. “It was a disaster,” said Menard. He snapped a swing in gym class and struggled to sit still during lessons. When teachers tried to give him instructions, he hit them. His speech plateaued and eventually regressed.  Menard, who cleans pools for a living, grew to fear the moment her phone rang. School employees, unable to soothe Benji’s tantrums, frequently called her to take him home. One morning last spring, they told her Benji had lashed out when an aide tried to persuade him to work, aggressively poking their hand with a pencil. He hadn’t broken the skin, but after a dozen incidents, the situation was becoming unsalvageable. The district made her sign a behavioral contract, his second in two years: If Benji didn’t behave, he could be suspended or expelled.  Menard felt she had no choice but to withdraw Benji. She enrolled him full time in a home-study program run by his therapy group, Aspire Behavioral Health Center in Lafayette, which costs about $10,000 a year in tuition, a substantial portion of her paycheck. That was in addition to the therapy cost, which his insurance still covered.  Benji’s clinicians determined he needed direct support for most of the day and told Optum they wanted him to scale up his therapy from 24 hours a week to 33. They expected the insurer would approve the request; after all, it was less than what was previously covered and only nine hours more than it was currently paying for.  But Optum denied the increase in a letter to Menard this past May. “Your child has been in ABA for six years,” the insurer wrote. “After six years, more progress would be expected.”  The response disturbed Whitney Newton, Benji’s behavior analyst and a clinical director at Aspire; it didn’t seem rooted in the established medical standards for the treatment. She’d seen firsthand how critical the therapy had been to his growth. “We know what he needs. It’s in our scope of practice and it’s our right as the provider to determine that,” she said. “They’re cutting and denying an unethical amount.”  The center’s founder, psychologist Joslyn McCoy, has grown accustomed to battling insurers. Her practice serves about 160 patients between the ages of 2 and 19 across five centers, and many have Medicaid coverage. In 2022, Louisiana expanded its Medicaid parameters, allowing parents with higher incomes to access coverage for children with complex medical needs.  “What I’m seeing is that children now have this ticket to access this care, but then once they go to try to access it, it’s being denied,” she said.  Nearly two years ago, Optum selected her center for a payment integrity audit, demanding to inspect its clinical and billing records. After her team turned over thousands of pages of documentation, Optum conducted a separate in-person quality review.  Internal company records show Optum is targeting ABA providers for scrutiny based on how much they invoice and how many services they provide. Groups like McCoy’s can be flagged for patterns that providers told ProPublica are typical in the delivery of ABA therapy: billing on weekends or holidays, serving multiple family members in one practice, having long clinician or patient days, providing an “above average delivery” of services, or abruptly increasing or decreasing the number of patients or claims.  Internal company documents reveal Optum’s strategy for identifying ABA providers for scrutiny based on “outlier patterns.” Obtained by ProPublica  McCoy said that a company executive who visited her office for the quality review told her that she approved of the center’s work and thought Aspire should expand across the state.  But Optum has continued to challenge her patients’ individual therapy claims.  When her team received the denial for Benji’s care, McCoy set out to gather hard evidence to demonstrate the necessity of his treatment. “It’s what we call a reversal to baseline, where we will withdraw the treatment for a short period of time,” McCoy said. “The reason is to demonstrate what happens because we’re curious, too: What happens if we withdraw the care?”  Much of the therapy is driven by positive reinforcement; for example, if Benji pays attention and engages in his academic exercises, he can take a break to play on his iPad. But the reward is contingent on him not hitting anyone for at least 10 minutes at a time. During the experiment, the clinicians took away the possibility of his reward, and without an incentive, they had limited leverage to manage his behavior.  Joslyn McCoy, founder and director of Aspire Behavioral Health Center. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  At first, Benji lightly hit the staff, they said, as though testing the limits. But when there was no response to his behavior, it began to escalate. He tossed chairs and flipped tables. He pushed Newton into a bookshelf, which collapsed to the ground. He hit walls and windows, eventually turning his fists on his aide. They stopped the experiment early, both for his safety and theirs.  Once they resumed the interventions, Benji was able to calm down.  Newton drafted a report, including line charts that quantified his behavior with and without the interventions and photographs of her team’s injuries. She faxed it to Optum, asking the company to reconsider the denial.  The insurer did not change its decision.  ‘The need is not going away’  Last month, inside a cubicle decorated with posters of Minions and Mario Brothers, a behavior technician placed a laminated card with an image of a sneaker in front of Benji.  “What is this?” she asked him.  Benji paused, rubbing the edge of his baseball cap and pursing his lips. “Sh,” he said, stuck on the consonant.  “Shoes, that’s right,” the technician responded. She pulled out another card, showing a slice topped with white frosting. “Is this cake?”  “No,” Benji said.  “Is this cake?” she repeated, before adding, “yes.”  “Yes,” echoed Benji, but her correction appeared to frustrate him. He hit the technician on the leg, softly but with determination.  “We’ll let it go,” she warned with a sugared voice, “but hands to self, OK?”  Benji works with registered behavioral technician Hortencia Cervantez during ABA treatment. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  After 10 minutes, a timer beeped. It was time for Benji’s reward, getting to hear a reggaeton hit by Daddy Yankee. “It’s a big reinforcer here,” Newton said.  Even though Optum denied the additional hours of treatment, Benji has continued to receive them. “We’re giving the hours even if they were not approved,” McCoy said. “We don’t think it would be safe for him to do what the insurance is saying.”  Next month, a state administrative law judge will hear an appeal for the additional hours. If the request is approved, Benji’s clinicians will be paid for the six months of services that they’ve provided without reimbursement.  Even if that happens, their battle with the insurer will go back to square one. Each insurance authorization typically lasts for only six months, and soon after the hearing date, the clinicians will have to request coverage for his treatment again.  They will be doing so at a time when internal records show Optum has deployed more than 90 “care advocates” to question clinicians about the medical necessity of their patients’ ABA treatment, using “quality initiatives to decrease overutilization and cost.”  Optum is focusing on states whose Medicaid plans yield the highest costs for ABA therapy, including Arizona, Nebraska, Tennessee, Virginia, New Jersey, Indiana and Louisiana, where Menard and her son live. ProPublica reached out to the state Medicaid programs with questions about their oversight of United’s practices. Arizona’s Medicaid agency told ProPublica that all managed care organizations, including United, are required to provide timely services within their networks, and that the agency has been closely monitoring ABA networks. (Read its full response.) No other state Medicaid agencies responded to ProPublica’s questions.  Internal company documents reveal Optum’s strategy for managing its ABA coverage. Obtained by ProPublica  Autism experts said such a strategy may not only be harmful to children, it could also ultimately be more expensive for states, as children age and require more intensive services, like residential or nursing care.  “If these kids get the intervention they need as children, then there will be tremendous cost savings over the course of their lives,” said Lorri Unumb, an attorney and CEO of the Council of Autism Service Providers.  Menard worries about what will happen to her son’s hard-fought gains if he can’t get the level of therapy he needs. And even if the additional nine hours are approved, she fears that with the next authorization, they could face a more drastic denial that could be challenging to overturn.

She just hopes the therapy helps him to be better able to advocate for himself and, ultimately, be safe. “There’s nothing else that I’ve known to work,” she said.  McCoy resents being put in the position of scaling back care that her patient needs because an insurer is refusing to pay. “It puts us in a tough place, because we don’t want to discontinue therapy of our client who’s not ready,” she said.  When such denials become common, it disincentivizes clinicians from working with insurance companies, she said, and can ultimately drive clinics into the ground. “The patients can’t afford it,” she said, “so eventually the private provider goes out of business.”  But even if children like Benji get pushed out of treatment, there is no shortage of children seeking care. McCoy’s center currently has a waitlist of about 260 children.  That list may likely expand. Internal documents show Optum is aiming to exclude from its network about 40% of Louisiana groups that offer ABA therapy. About 1 in 5 children whose treatment is covered by the company’s Medicaid plan in the state could lose access to care.  “If the insurance company wants to deny all of our clients, we’re going to replace them,” she said. “The need is not going away.”"

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  Flybys of Jupiter’s fiery moon Io, carried out by NASA’s Juno spacecraft, are helping to solve the enduring mystery of why the small moon is the most volcanically active body in our solar system.  Similar in size to Earth’s moon, Io has an estimated 400 volcanoes that continuously release plumes and lava that coat that moon’s surface.  The Juno mission, which has been orbiting and observing Jupiter and its moons since July 2016, made incredibly close flybys of Io in December 2023 and February. The spacecraft zipped within 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) of the moon’s surface, capturing images and data. Together, Juno’s flybys have enabled an unprecedented look at the smoldering moon, including taking observations of its poles for the first time.  Researchers presented some of the results from an analysis of the flyby data Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in Washington, DC. A paper detailing some of the findings was also published Thursday in the journal Nature.  “Io is one of the most intriguing objects in the whole solar system,” said study coauthor Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator and an associate vice president at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “We can see that this body is completely covered with volcanoes over both poles and all across its middle, (which are) constantly going off.”  Volcanoes on the surface of Io erupt continuously, as depicted in this animation. NASA  The new data suggests that Io’s numerous volcanoes are each likely powered by their own chamber of hot magma, rather than being fed by a global ocean of magma beneath the surface. The latter had long been a prevailing hypothesis by astronomers.  The finding could change the way astronomers understand moons dominated by subsurface global oceans in our solar system, such as Jupiter’s moon Europa and planets beyond our solar system.  Spotting a cosmic pizza  Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, known as the father of modern astronomy, discovered Io on January 8, 1610.  But the moon’s wild volcanic activity wasn’t detected until Voyager 1 flew by Jupiter and its moons in 1979, revealing Io’s dynamic surface that resembled a pepperoni pizza, Bolton said.  NASA's Juno spacecraft captures the north polar region of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io on December 30, 2023. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS  That year, Linda Morabito, an imaging scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, became the first person to identify a volcanic plume as she studied an image of Io captured by Voyager 1.  The revelation sparked a decades-long mystery as astronomers wondered about the origins of Io’s constant volcanic activity.  “Since Morabito’s discovery, planetary scientists have wondered how the volcanoes were fed from the lava underneath the surface,” Bolton said. “Was there a shallow ocean of white-hot magma fueling the volcanoes, or was their source more localized? We knew data from Juno’s two very close flybys could give us some insights on how this tortured moon actually worked.”  This sequence of images taken by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2007 shows a giant plume from Io's Tvashtar volcano. NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute  Flyby revelations  Io orbits around Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, which Bolton calls a “monster.” The moon’s orbit is imperfect, meaning that sometimes it comes closer to Jupiter during its orbit, and other times it is farther away. Io completes one orbit around the planet every 42.5 hours.  Jupiter’s massive gravitational influence squeezes Io as it orbits the planet, like a hand squeezing a rubber ball, which warms up the moon. This phenomenon is called tidal flexing, or friction from tidal forces that generate internal heat.  “That’s what’s happening inside Io,” Bolton said. “That squeezing is generating heat, and it’s getting so hot that (Io’s) insides are literally melting and popping out. The eruptions are constant. It’s like a nonstop rainstorm. It’s just always erupting all over the place.”  Io is tiny in comparison with Jupiter, as seen in this animation, and the giant planet's gravitational forces cause the inhospitable conditions on the fiery moon. CNN/NASA  The constant flexing of Jupiter’s tug on Io generates immense energy, which would melt part of the moon’s interior, Bolton said. And if the melting was substantial enough, it would create a global magma ocean that Juno could use its instruments to detect.  During its close flybys, Juno captured high-precision Doppler data, which measured Io’s gravity by tracking how zipping closely to the moon affected the spacecraft’s acceleration. The data was compared with observations from previous missions that have flown by Jupiter and its moons, such as NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, as well as ground-based telescopes.  Together, the observations point to a rigid, mostly solid interior beneath Io’s surface, rather than a global magma ocean — solving a 45-year mystery started by Voyager 1’s observations. Instead, the volcanoes are powered by more local sources, and each one has its own pocket of magma beneath it.  “Juno’s discovery that tidal forces do not always create global magma oceans does more than prompt us to rethink what we know about Io’s interior,” said lead study author Ryan Park, a Juno co-investigator and supervisor of the Solar System Dynamics Group at JPL, in a statement. “It has implications for our understanding of other moons, such as (Saturn’s) Enceladus and Europa, and even exoplanets and super-Earths. Our new findings provide an opportunity to rethink what we know about planetary formation and evolution.”  The mission has also helped to capture an array of imagery that showcases Io’s “primordial fantasy land surface,” said Heidi Becker, a planetary scientist at JPL who was not involved in the study. The images are bringing different features on Io into focus like never before, including islands spotted on massive lava lakes, such as one called Loki Patera, which is so large that astronomers compare it more to a lava sea sitting on Io’s surface.  This animation shows the harsh features created by lava on the surface of Io. CNN/JPL  The Juno spacecraft continues to contribute new insights about Jupiter and its moons, having recently completed a flyby over Jupiter’s swirling cloud tops on November 24. Next, Juno will swing by 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers) above Jupiter’s center on December 27, logging 645.7 million miles (1.04 billion kilometers) since beginning its investigation of Jupiter eight years ago."
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/from-true-crimes-to-terror-when-is-dark-tourism-too-dark/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,From true crimes to terror: When is ‘dark tourism’ too dark?,"CNN —  Fifty years ago, parishioners from Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple in San Francisco began to settle a rural commune in the South American country of Guyana. The Jonestown experiment ended four years later in one of the most tragic and bizarre murder-suicide incidents in American history. More than 900 people died on November 18, 1978, including a US congressman named Leo Ryan.  Now that Guyana is considering a proposal by a government-backed tour operator to open the now-overgrown compound to visitors, it raises a fascinating debate about the appeal, ethics and sensitivities of so-called “dark tourism” — the visiting of sites associated with tragedy.  Why are the locations of past atrocities, natural disasters, infamous deaths and incarcerations so popular with visitors? What does it say about us that we want to get close to these vortexes of disaster and evil? What obligations do governments have to give or deny access? Who gets to decide how history is presented to visitors? And what impact do such events and the subsequent visitors have on those who live near these spots?  There are no simple answers, but it’s important to explore the questions anyway.  Is it not simply history?  The welcome sign at the entrance of Jonestown, Guyana in 2022.

Design Pics Inc/Shutterstock dark tourism Prev Next  On my first cross-country trip, in college, my girlfriend and I stopped at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, the site of a battle in which nearly 200 died, including a former US congressman named Davy Crockett. Then a week later in Los Angeles, local relatives of mine took us on a driving tour that included the crime scene address of then-recently murdered Nicole Brown Simpson. The former visit felt like a US history lesson, the latter like morbid gawking. And somewhere in between is the subjective line that dark tourism dances around.  Dark tourism (also known as memorial tourism, or thanatourism, from the Greek “Thanatos” meaning death, or more derogatorily as morbid tourism, or grief tourism) comes in various shades.  Gettysburg was the single deadliest battle in the US Civil War, where 51,000 souls took their last breath, and yet where countless school field trips and, according to the National Park Service, 1.5 million visitors flock every year. Is that dark tourism? How about visiting the beaches in France where between 8,000 and 14,000 soldiers died in the D-Day invasions that turned the tide for Allies winning World War II? And what of Ground Zero and Flight 93 memorials for more than 3,000 who died on September 11, 2001?  I have toured Cambodia’s Killing Fields, with a survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide that left between 1.5 and 3 million murdered (in the four years following the Jonestown tragedy). Isn’t it important to visit atrocities such as that one, and former Nazi concentration camps?  The point of visiting these places is to feel uncomfortable, to bear witness, to share what you’ve seen and how it made you feel. Travel changes us, and sometimes because of exposure to the worst of human nature.  You’ve heard of the Disneyfication of places. Dark tourism is the opposite of that. These are the unhappiest places on earth. Yet they are places you should never forget. To go there honors the dead, their memory, their pain.  How far is too far?  There are examples when the line seems less clear, where bearing witness to past events feels more like slowing down to see the aftermath of a fatal car accident.  The first time I visited Savannah, Georgia I took a “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” tour. This was not long after the best-selling book of that name became a Hollywood film chronicling a real double murder that took place less than 10 years earlier. On the tour I kept thinking, “The people who live next door to these places may actually remember the victims, may have even been friends with them.”  People outside the Beverly Hills, California mansion where brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents in 1989 David Swanson/AFP/Getty Images  Just last month we reported on how the Los Angeles mansion where Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents has become the latest “dark tourism” hot spot. The brothers are back in the news and the subject of a recent documentary, but it’s hard to imagine what visitors are learning by simply staring at a crime scene. It reminded me of my Simpson murder scene visit, or the time I tried to find LA’s Cielo Drive, the site of the 1969 murders by the Manson “family.”  But how many degrees are those stops from touring Ford’s Theatre in Washington DC where a president was shot, or the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas from which another was? Is it ok to see thousands of Mount Vesuvius’ victims in Pompei, Italy because they were killed 2,000 years ago? How about going on an entertaining tour of Jack the Ripper’s victims in London from the late 1800s? Or paying a lot of money to go deep underwater for a view of the Titanic – where visitors themselves died last year while exploring a shipwreck where about 1,500 died just over 100 years ago? Does time desensitize us to these crimes and tragedies?  What is your intention?  In the early 2000s, while visiting friends living in Gloucester, Massachusetts, I felt an undertow pulling me toward the Crow’s Nest, the local bar made famous in a book by Sebastian Junger and the subsequent film of the same name, “The Perfect Storm.” They document the 1991 storm and final days of six fishermen from the small, tight knit community who frequented the Crow’s Nest.  On one visit I was walking along Gloucester’s small harbor when I saw a new ice cream shop had opened called The Perfect Scoop. I thought it rather distasteful, a description I’ve never before nor since used to describe ice cream, and it left me feeling embarrassed for having wanted to visit the Crow’s Nest. I decided to leave the salty bar to the locals.  The bookcase to the secret annex in the renovated Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

This summer I’m planning a family trip to Japan and added Hiroshima to the itinerary because I feel it’s important for my daughters to make a connection to the violence our country unleashed on another country, killing at least 66,000 in that city alone.  And I’ve long wanted to visit Jonestown. When I lived in San Francisco, just before seeing a show at the famous Fillmore auditorium, I popped around the corner to see the location of Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple, the last stop before Guyana. I feel drawn to follow that nightmare of a story into the real world, where it has been sitting in situ since the mass deaths. I want to talk to those who live nearby, understand the events more clearly, bear witness, go into the heart of darkness.  Perhaps the salient question to ask oneself before planning such a trip is: What is the intention? Is it to learn and understand? Or is it merely to scratch the itch of a morbid curiosity? Think about the locals, of the friends and family who are connected to the tragedy and ask whether visiting honors a legacy or exploits a tragedy. In the end, you may be the only one who can judge the ethics of visiting these places."

Nancy Pelosi underwent a “successful” hip replacement surgery Saturday and is “well on the mend,” according to a spokesperson, one day after being hospitalized from an injury sustained during an official engagement in Luxembourg.  Pelosi was admitted to a hospital in Luxembourg as the result of a fall on the stairs, three sources told CNN. Pelosi’s office declined to comm﻿ent on how the California congresswoman was injured.  Pelosi, 84, is receiving “excellent care” from doctors and medical professionals, Ian Krager, the spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday.  The US military had medevaced the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. The medical center is a major military hospital that for years has treated US troops injured in combat.  “While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,” Krager said Friday.  Pelosi is “currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals. She continues to work and regrets that she is unable to attend the remainder of the CODEL engagements to honor the courage of our servicemembers during one of the greatest acts of American heroism in our nation’s history,” Krager said, adding that Pelosi “looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.”  The injury sustained by Pelosi came just days after longtime Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell tripped and fell at the US Capitol, spraining his wrist and cutting his face.  McConnell sustained a “minor cut to the face” and was “cleared to resume his schedule,” a spokesperson for the 82-year-old Kentucky Republican said in a statement Tuesday.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/entertainment/jay-z-lawsuit-response/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Jay-Z says inconsistencies in rape accuser’s story proves her attorney was looking for ‘money and fame’,"CNN —  Jay-Z is doubling down on his denial that he ever raped a teenage girl alongside Sean “Diddy” Combs, saying that newly revealed inconsistencies in her story prove that her account is not credible.  Earlier this week, an anonymous Jane Doe filed an amended complaint against Combs and Jay-Z, whose given name is Shawn Carter, which revealed that a previously unnamed celebrity in her original complaint against Combs, initially filed in October, was Carter. In the amended complaint, Carter is accused of raping the then-13-year-old Jane Doe at an afterparty for the MTV Video Music Awards in the year 2000.  The amended complaint made Carter the first celebrity to be accused of sexual assault in connection to Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to three federal charges and is awaiting a criminal trial.  In a new interview on Friday, the Jane Doe said she is standing by her rape accusation against Carter, but admits to inconsistencies in her original story, including key corroborating witnesses.  “I have made some mistakes,” the Jane Doe told NBC News. “You should always advocate for yourself and be a voice for yourself. You should never let what somebody else did ruin or run your life. I just hope I can give others the strength to come forward like I came forward.”  In her initial complaint, Jane Doe said that she asked her father to pick her up in 2000 after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Carter and Combs. But her father now said that he does not recall picking her up, according to NBC News, which also reported that Jane Doe said that she spoke to a celebrity the night she alleged she was raped, but that celebrity said they were not in New York at the time her allegations took place.  Jane Doe’s attorney, Tony Buzbee, said that he is still vetting his client’s claims, but is standing by her accusations.  “Our client remains fiercely adamant that what she has stated is true, to the best of her memory. We will continue to vet her claims and collect corroborating data to the extent it exists. Because we have interrogated her intensely, she has even agreed to submit to a polygraph. I’ve never had a client suggest that before,” Buzbee told CNN via email on Friday evening. “In any event, we always do our best to vet each claim made, just as we did in this case. This has been extremely distressing for her, to the point she has experienced seizures and had to seek medical treatment due to the stress.”  In a statement issued to CNN, Carter said that the woman’s inconsistencies “proves” that Buzbee “filed a false complaint against me in the pursuit of money and fame.”  “This incident didn’t happen and yet he filed it in court and doubled down in the press,” Carter’s statement continued. “True Justice is coming. We fight FROM victory, not FOR victory. This was over before it began. This 1-800 lawyer doesn’t realize it yet, but, soon.”  Carter’s attorney, Alex Spiro, told CNN: “It is stunning that a lawyer would not only file such a serious complaint without proper vetting, but would make things worse by further peddling this false story in the press. We are asking the Court to dismiss this frivolous case today, and will take up the matter of additional discipline for Mr. Buzbee and all the lawyers that filed the complaint.”  Spiro also filed a letter to the judge on Friday night, regarding the inconsistencies in Jane Doe’s account, calling her allegations a “sham.”  “Basic facts in her narrative – the who, what, when, and where – are wrong,” Spiro wrote to the judge. “When pressed, the Plaintiff admitted she was ‘guessing’ about key details… She admits she has no single corroborating witness over the last 24 years.”  Prior to Buzbee filing Jane Doe’s amended complaint in which Carter was named, Carter’s lawyers had filed an extortion suit against Buzbee, claiming that the Houston-based attorney was trying to “shakedown innocent celebrities, politicians, and businesspeople with an army of masked accusers.”  Lawyers for Combs, who has previously denied all civil allegations against him, criticized Buzbee in a statement to CNN.  “This is the beginning of the end of this shameful money grab.”"

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Downtown San Francisco experiences first tornado warning in recorded history,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said. Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and about 300 miles northwest of Sacramento."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/india/india-pollution-kids-health-hnk-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Delhi smog: Meet the kids struggling to breathe in India’s choked capital,"New Delhi CNN —  As pollution worsens in the Indian capital, parents are facing an impossible choice: stay or go.  Amrita Rosha, 45, is among those choosing to flee with her children. Both of them — Vanaaya, 4, and Abhiraj, 9 — suffer from respiratory problems due to rising pollution and need medication.  “We have no other option but to leave Delhi,” Rosha, a housewife who is married to a businessman, told CNN last month from her home in an affluent South Delhi neighborhood as she completed last-minute packing before leaving for the Gulf state of Oman.  Every year for the past decade, a blanket of smog has enveloped Delhi when winter approaches, turning day into night and disrupting the lives of millions of people. Some of them, particularly young children with less developed immune systems, are forced to seek medical care for breathing issues.  Rosha ensures her children get top health care — including doctors’ visits, steamers, inhalers and steroids — and trips outside Delhi to escape the choking air.  Amrita Rosha with her children Vanaaya, 4, and Abhiraj, 9, in her bungalow in South Delhi. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  While wealthy families like the Roshas can escape, it’s a different story for those without the means to leave.  About 15 miles away in a Delhi slum, Muskan, who goes by her first name, looks on with worry at the remaining medicine drops for her children’s nebulizer, a machine which turns liquid medication into fine mist to be inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece.  The mother rations its use because she struggles to afford more.  “We give half-half (of the dosage) of the medicines to our children,” she said, referring to Chahat, 3, and Diya, 1. They’ve been on nebulizers since each of their first winters, as early as they were born.  Muskan bought the $9 nebulizer after weeks of hard work on the streets. She makes a living picking up rags and other pieces of refuse, and her husband is a day laborer.  “When they cough, I feel scared that my children may die. I’m filled with regret, as I keep worrying about something awful happening to them,” she said.  Muskan holds her daughter Diya while while her 3-year-old son Chahat uses the nebulizer. “He thinks it is a toy,” she said as he puts it on himself with ease. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  Leaving Delhi  The suffering of Delhi’s children, year after year, has become impossible to ignore.  “Children are having to rely on steroids and inhalers to breathe … all of north India has been pushed into a medical emergency,” Delhi’s Chief Minister Atishi, who goes by her first name, said last month.  The Supreme Court has stepped in to monitor the measures introduced to curb pollution, which is generally caused by a combination of factors including vehicular emissions, crop burning and construction work, along with unfavorable meteorological and climatic conditions.  This has included banning cars, demolition and construction work, and spraying roads with water. Authorities have also increased public transport and cracked down on crop burning.  Despite these measures, Delhi has remained the most polluted city across India in November for eight years, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.  Manjinder Singh Randhawa, a doctor in the pediatric intensive care unit at the Rainbow Children’s Hospital, said this year he has been diagnosing younger children with asthma in “a very critical state” for the first time.  Video Ad Feedback India's toxic smog puts children at risk 02:54 - Source: CNN  In the long-term, pollution can have a serious impact on the respiratory, immune and cardiovascular systems, he added.  CNN has reached out for comment to the central and state government, and the Commission for Air Quality Management responsible for maintaining air quality in the region.  In some parts of Delhi last month, pollution levels exceeded 1,750 on the Air Quality Index, according to IQAir, which monitors global air pollution. Any reading above 300 is considered a health hazard.  During these weeks the pollution levels for PM 2.5, smaller particles which can penetrate deep into the lungs, spiked to more than 70 times the health limits set by the World Health Organization. It was over 20 times that level this week. Studies indicate that inhaling PM 2.5 can lead to cognitive impairment in children.  A costly escape  Some parents, like Deepthi Ramdas, prioritized their children’s health and relocated years ago. When her son Rudra was born three years ago, she did not think leaving Delhi would ever be on the cards. But that changed when she saw him admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in January 2022.  The doctors told her she should leave Delhi if she wanted her son’s lungs to develop, Deepthi recalled. Since she had family in the southern state of Kerala, she decided to go.  “It was not an easy decision. I had to quit my job which I loved… and because my husband had to continue to be in Delhi for work… we got into a long-distance marriage,” she said.  Deepthi Ramdas' son was hospitalized when he was less than a year old in 2022. “We keep this as a keepsake to remember one of his worst times yet,” she said. Deepthi Ramdas  But Deepthi finds relief in knowing Rudra has had no breathing issues in Kerala. They visited Delhi in the first week of December to meet their father. “We hoped since he is 3 now (that) his lungs would be stronger, but within a few days Rudra had an attack and was on nebulizers again,” Deepthi said.  “Looking at him like that was heartbreaking. There is no way I am moving back to Delhi,” she said, sharing pictures of Rudra from when he was in hospital in 2022 to him playing outdoors in Kerala in October.  Anxiety in the air  Many parents in Delhi are living under anxiety fueled by their inability to escape the city due to work and other commitments.  “This is not something you just do, you have to plan it, and be fortunate enough,” 29-year-old mother Urvee Parasramka told CNN. Her daughter Reva, 2, has been on nebulizers since her first winter, she said.  When Urvee was expecting, she recalls her husband, Prateek Tulsyan, responding to news of pollution by saying he’d ensure there were enough air purifiers at home to protect his child. However, nine months after delivery, Reva had her first attack.  “There was a lot of panic then. It was hard to understand why she even needed such heavy medication. I was very scared. It took me a while to come around,” Prateek told CNN.  Urvee added: “I am constantly checking her temperature, do not allow her to go out or eat anything that may exacerbate her condition. I am now an over-protective parent.”  If she hears Reva sneeze, she knows a cough is coming, followed by congestion and then the need for the nebulizer.  Urvee said they’ve decided to move to Guwahati, northeast India, where the air quality is better, during the high pollution months next year.  “I am born and brought up here, comfortable here, so to create another home there won’t be easy but we have no choice,” she said.  No way out  Muskan and her neighbors in the Delhi slum are not as fortunate.  She runs to the shared nebulizer when her children show symptoms like chest pain, coughing or vomiting. She says the children ask for it themselves and use it with practiced precision. But not everyone is able to afford to have the machine at home.  Some of her neighbors rush to the nearest private clinic and pay about 80 rupees or $1 for each treatment.  One of them is Deepak Kumar, a daily wage worker with four children. His youngest and only daughter, Kripa, 1, is using a nebulizer for the second consecutive winter season since her birth.  Deepak Kumar holds his daughter Kripa, 1, for whom he has had to take on debt to pay for urgent medical expenses. “If I put her down she starts crying,” he said. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  “The doctor asked us to buy it, but we do not have that kind of money,” he said.  One visit to the doctor costs more than his daily wage.  Nights are the worst. When there are no doctors available, he relies on balms and steam to help his daughter get through the night. Even when she is sleeping well, the mounting debt due to medical expenses keeps him awake.  “Yes, I am in debt of 20,000 rupees ($235) and to pay that off I am trying to work even harder,” he said.  Many like Kumar have come to Delhi from different parts of India to seek a better life, but they’re stuck.  “It should not be so hard to live in the capital,” he said."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/science/oldest-human-dna-neanderthal-ancestry/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Oldest human DNA helps pinpoint when early humans interbred with Neanderthals,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  Scientists say they have recovered the oldest known Homo sapiens DNA from human remains found in Europe, and the information is helping to reveal our species’ shared history with Neanderthals.  The ancient genomes sequenced from 13 bone fragments unearthed in a cave beneath a medieval castle in Ranis, Germany, belonged to six individuals, including a mother, daughter and distant cousins who lived in the region around 45,000 years ago, according to the study that published Thursday in the journal Nature.  The genomes carried evidence of Neanderthal ancestry. Researchers determined that the ancestors of those early humans who lived in Ranis and the surrounding area likely encountered and made babies with Neanderthals about 80 generations earlier, or 1,500 years earlier, although that interaction did not necessarily happen in the same place.  Scientists have known since the first Neanderthal genome was sequenced in 2010 that early humans interbred with Neanderthals, a bombshell revelation that bequeathed a genetic legacy still traceable in humans today.  However, exactly when, how often and where this critical and mysterious juncture in human history took place has been hard to pin down. Scientists have believed interspecies relations would have occurred somewhere in the Middle East as a wave of Homo sapiens left Africa and bumped into Neanderthals, who had lived across Eurasia for 250,000 years.  The cave where the ancient human remains were found is located beneath a castle in Ranis, Germany. Martin Schutt/picture alliance/Getty Images  A broader study on Neanderthal ancestry, published Thursday in the journal Science, that analyzed information from the genomes of 59 ancient humans and those of 275 living humans corroborated the more precise timeline, finding that the majority of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans can be attributed to a “single, shared extended period of gene flow.”  “We were far more similar than we were different,” Priya Moorjani, a senior author of the Science study and an assistant professor in the department of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, said at a news briefing.  “The differences that we imagined between these groups to be very big, actually, were very small, genetically speaking. They seem to have mixed with each other for a long period of time and were living side by side for a long period of time.”  The research pinpointed a pivotal period that began about 50,500 years ago and ended around 43,500 years ago — not long before the now extinct Neanderthals began to disappear from the archaeological record. Over this 7,000-year time frame, early humans encountered Neanderthals, had sex and gave birth to children on a fairly regular basis. The height of the activity was 47,000 years ago, the study suggested.  The research also showed how certain genetic variants inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors, which make up between 1% and 3% of our genomes today, varied over time. Some, such as those related to the immune system, were beneficial to humans as they lived through the last ice age, when temperatures were much cooler, and they continue to confer benefits today.  The two studies lend “substantial confidence” to the timing of when humans and Neanderthals exchanged genes, something geneticists describe as introgression, said evolutionary geneticist Tony Capra, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics in the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute at the University of California, San Francisco.  “Genetic data from this crucial period in our evolution are very rare,” said Capra, who wasn’t involved in the research, via email. “These studies underscore how having even a few ancient genomes provides powerful perspective that enabled the authors to refine our understanding of human migration and Neanderthal introgression.”  A skull found in Zlatý kůň in the Czech Republic contains DNA that linked the woman to the Ranis individuals. Marek Jantač  The scientists working on the two research projects decided to publish their work at the same time when they realized they had separately reached a similar conclusion.  How Neanderthal ancestry has shaped human genes  The research in Science found that genetic variants inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors are unevenly distributed across the human genome.  Some regions, which the scientists call “archaic deserts,” are devoid of Neanderthal genes. These deserts likely developed quickly after the two groups interbred, within 100 generations, perhaps because they resulted in birth defects or diseases that would have affected the survival chances of the offspring.  “It suggests that hybrid individuals who had Neanderthal DNA in these regions were substantially less fit, likely to due to severe disease, lethality, or infertility,” Capra said via email.  In particular, the X chromosome was a desert. Capra said the effects of Neanderthal variants that cause disease could be greater on the X chromosome, perhaps because it is present in two copies in females, but only present in one copy in males.  “The X chromosome also has many genes that are linked to male fertility when modified, so it has been proposed that some of this effect could have come from introgression leading to male hybrid sterility,” he said.  The Neanderthal gene variants detected most frequently in ancient and modern Homo sapiens genomes are related to traits and functions that included immune function, skin pigmentation and metabolism, with some increasing in frequency over time.  “Neanderthals were living outside Africa in harsh, ice age climates and were adapted to the climate and to the pathogens in these environments. When modern humans left Africa and interbred with Neanderthals, some individuals inherited Neanderthal genes that presumably allowed them to adapt and thrive better in the environment,” said Leonardo Iasi, co-lead author of the Science paper and a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.  The individuals living at Ranis had 2.9% Neanderthal ancestry, not dissimilar to most people today, the Nature study found.  The new timeline allows scientists to understand better when humans left Africa and migrated around the world. It suggested that the main wave of migration out of Africa was essentially done by 43,500 years ago because most humans outside Africa today have Neanderthal ancestry originating from this period, the Science study suggested.  However, there is still much scientists don’t know. It’s not clear why people in East Asia today have more Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans, or why Neanderthal genomes from this period show little evidence of Homo sapiens DNA.  While the genomes sequenced from the Ranis individuals are the oldest Homo sapiens ones, scientists have previously recovered and analyzed DNA from Neanderthal remains that date back 400,000 years.  Lost branch of the human family tree  The individuals who called the cave in Ranis home were among the first Homo sapiens to live in Europe.  These early Europeans numbered a few hundred and included a woman who lived 230 kilometers (143 miles) away in Zlatý kůň in the Czech Republic. DNA from her skull was sequenced in a previous study, and researchers involved in the Nature study were able to connect her to the Ranis individuals.  These individuals had dark skin, dark hair and brown eyes, according to the study, perhaps reflecting their relatively recent arrival from Africa. Scientists are continuing to study remains from the site to piece together their diet and how they lived.  The family group was part of a pioneer population that eventually died out, leaving no trace of ancestry in people alive today. Other lineages of ancient humans also went extinct around 40,000 years ago and disappeared just like the Neanderthals ultimately did, said Johannes Krause, director at the department of archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. These extinctions may suggest that Homo sapiens did not play a role in the demise of Homo neanderthalensis.  “It’s kind of interesting to see that human story is not always a story of success,” said Krause, a senior author of the Nature study."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/sport/lindsey-vonn-world-cup-skiing-return-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Lindsey Vonn to make World Cup skiing return in St. Moritz,"CNN —  Skiing great Lindsey Vonn has announced that she will make her World Cup return at St Moritz, Switzerland next weekend.  In a video posted by her sponsor, Red Bull, on Friday, the 40-year-old Vonn said: “So, I have some news. My body is finally put back together and I hear St Moritz is pretty nice this time of year.”  Vonn announced her retirement from competitive skiing in 2019 after 18 years on the World Cup circuit. In that time, she recorded 82 World Cup race wins, eight world championship medals and three Winter Olympic medals.  After undergoing successful partial knee replacement surgery earlier this year, the American star decided to return to ski racing.  “I feel stronger now than I did in my late 20s,” she said, per Reuters. “The passion for skiing has never gone away, I just wasn’t physically able to do it anymore.  “It was pretty soon after surgery and in the rehab process that I was already doing things that I hadn’t done in years,” she added.  “My body was just functioning better. Obviously, I am a lot happier because I’m not in pain 24 hours a day. I’m getting stronger and better and faster than I was for a long, long period of time.”  Vonn recently competed in lower-level events in Copper Mountain, Colorado in order to gain eligibility to compete at World Cup races.  According to The Associated Press, she will race in two super-G events in St. Moritz, where she has previously won five World Cup titles. The super-G competitions in the Swiss resort are scheduled to take place on December 21 and 22.  The US Ski Team confirmed to CNN that Vonn will compete in St. Moritz.  “One thing I realized is that life is really short,” Vonn said in the video posted by Red Bull. “If you have an opportunity, you have to take it. There’s nothing that I love more than ski racing.”  Vonn’s haul of 82 World Cup wins puts her third on the all-time list behind Sweden’s Ingemar Stenmark on 86 and compatriot Mikaela Shiffrin on 99."
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/christmas-railway-station-romance-chance-encounters/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,Her flight was delayed and she missed her train home for Christmas. Then she met her future husband on the platform,"CNN —  When frazzled twentysomething traveler Jennea arrived at London’s King’s Cross railway station on December 15, 2013, the station was absolutely packed.  Carol singers in one corner were singing with gusto, collecting money for charity in brightly colored buckets. Gathered in the middle of the Victorian concourse, crowds of travelers stood, wrapped in coats and scarfs, looking up at the departure boards, waiting for their platform to be announced.  Passengers jostled past each other, armed with bags of gifts and large suitcases. Exhausted and a little overwhelmed, Jennea still found time to be charmed by the festive atmosphere. She took a moment to put down her heavy bag and check the departure board, searching for her train.  Jennea, who’d grown up in the US, had spent the last 18 months in Mozambique, where she’d been volunteering for the US Peace Corps. She hadn’t seen her loved ones in almost two years, and now she was en route to reunite with them in Cambridge, England.  The thought of hugging her mom, catching up with her aunt and uncle and distributing her gifts to her family kept Jennea going as she hoisted her heavy backpack onto her back, and headed towards her platform.  “I was absolutely loaded down — two suitcases, a backpackers’ backpack, my handbag…” Jennea tells CNN Travel today. “It’s Christmastime. I’m packed to the brim with Christmas presents. Making my way through King’s Cross Station, completely absorbed.”  When Jennea got to the platform, it was unnervingly empty. This was surprising.  “I remember thinking, ‘This platform is very quiet. It’s so close to Christmas and it’s King’s Cross, that’s bizarre. I don’t even know if I’m in the right place. What if I’ve misread the platform number incorrectly?’”  Jennea glanced around for someone to ask. She couldn’t see a train guard or another passenger.  “And not only that, there were two trains on the platform as well.”  It wasn’t clear which was the right train.  Jennea felt herself start to panic. She was already leaving London much later than she’d initially planned. And she was exhausted from traveling from the Mozambique village where she was volunteering to Malawi, then to Kenya, then to the UK.  “It took four days,” Jennea recalls. “And even then, when I finally landed in London, there was this massive delay on the airplane.  “Because of this, I had missed my plan A train, my plan B train, my plan everything train… It was 2013 and I didn’t have an iPhone yet. I couldn’t get a hold of my aunt and uncle who were going to be picking me up.”  Just as Jennea felt the stress and tiredness start to overwhelm her, she heard a voice behind her.  “Excuse me, is this the train to Cambridge?”  A train station conversation  Jennea and Arthur immediately hit it off at King's Cross railway station in December 2013. Dreamcapture Fotografie  Jennea turned around and saw a man, also wrapped in a hat and scarf, but significantly less weighed down by luggage.  “I was so relieved,” recalls Jennea. “I replied, ‘Oh I hope it’s going to Cambridge. That’s where I’m going.’”  As she spoke, Jennea realized she hadn’t had a conversation in four days — other than perfunctory airport and airplane interactions. She felt a strange feeling of ease with this stranger, who smiled at her and offered to help her with her bags as they boarded the train together.  As Jennea apologized for the heaviness of her luggage and the guy told her not to worry about it, Jennea thought she detected something familiar in his voice.  “Are you American?” she asked.  “No, I’m Dutch,” he said, smiling. “But I live in London. I’m Arthur.”  “I’m Jennea,” said Jennea, smiling back.  In mutual, unspoken agreement, Jennea and Arthur — who have requested their last names not be included in this story for privacy reasons — sat down on the train, opposite one another. They carried on talking.  “It was just very easy conversation,” recalls Jennea.  The carriage gradually filled up, and an overhead announcement confirmed the train was heading to Cambridge.  Arthur asked Jennea what brought her to the UK, and Jennea explained her mother was Irish, that she had family in Ireland and the UK, and they were all gathering there for the festive period.  As for Arthur, he explained he’d moved to London for college a few years previously. He was currently working in finance while he studied part time for a PhD — and he wasn’t heading to Cambridge for the holidays, but for something a little more unusual.  “I’d been invited to go to Cambridge by a friend of mine who was a novice monk,” Arthur tells CNN Travel today. “He basically invited me to spend a few days as a mini retreat away from the Big Smoke.”  Arthur had approached Jennea on the platform because he was confused about the train.  “It was initially purely functional dialogue,” is how Arthur puts it. “Trying to get on the train, trying to get to Cambridge… but then it quickly morphed into a very easygoing conversation about lots of different topics. It felt like there was a lot of common ground.”  “People say, ‘Was it love at first sight?’” says Jennea, of that first interaction with Arthur. “And I say this lovingly, but no, no, it wasn’t. It was just relief: ‘Thank God there’s someone else on the platform.’ And then it was functional. ‘Okay, where am I going? What am I doing?’ But then we sat down, and started talking.”  For both Arthur and Jennea, this conversation was the hook. They were intrigued by each other. Arthur knew nothing about the Peace Corps. Jennea was fascinated by the idea of having a friend who was a monk. Their conversation just flowed.  As the train — now full of people — weaved its way through the series of tunnels that carry trains northward out of King’s Cross, Arthur and Jennea kept talking.  “There wasn’t that point where it became awkward and silent and you’re thinking, ‘Do I dig out my book and pretend to read now?’” says Jennea. “No. We chatted the entire time.”  About an hour later, the train pulled into Cambridge station, and Arthur helped Jennea gather her many bags. They exchanged details, promising to add one another on Facebook, and they were still deep in conversation as the train pulled to a halt.  “Then, as we stepped off onto the platform, my aunt and my uncle were actually right there, and I was so relieved because they’d waited for me,” says Jennea. “I hadn’t seen my family in years at this point, it had been a long time, so I just threw my arms around my uncle, and then my aunt.”  Meanwhile Arthur hung back, still holding Jennea’s suitcases.  “He was standing there with my bags — my aunt said, ‘Oh my gosh, look at you. You’ve gone all the way to Mozambique, and you’ve come back, and here’s a man standing with your bags. What have you done?’” recalls Jennea, laughing.  “It was kind of an, ‘Alright, bye,’ moment,” says Arthur, also laughing.  Arthur and Jennea didn’t hug farewell — they both suddenly felt a little awkward in that moment. But as they walked in opposite directions, they each turned around to smile at one another, and wave.  “I was sort of thinking, ‘Oh, that was really nice. What a great start to my Christmas holidays,’” recalls Jennea. “But I had no idea what would happen next.”  Staying in touch  Arthur and Jennea had lots in common from the outset and stayed in touch after their railway meeting. Arthur and Jennea  When Jennea got to her aunt’s house, she spent the next couple of hours catching up with her family, sharing stories of her mammoth journey and her work in Mozambique.  Later, when she finally connected to the Wi-Fi on her cell phone, Jennea saw she had a friend request from Arthur. She accepted, and he sent through a message right away, saying how great it was to meet her.  “And then we just kept exchanging Facebook messages back and forth over the holidays,” says Jennea. “I kept sneaking away into the room I was staying at my aunt’s house to try and message privately.”  Jennea and Arthur picked back up the conversation they’d started on the train, sending instant messages regularly back and forth. After a couple of days, they started talking on the phone.  A few days before Christmas, Jennea’s parents arrived in Cambridge.  “As soon as my mom arrived, my aunt said, ‘I think she’s met someone in the UK.’ And my mom was like, ‘Who did she meet? She’s only just landed?’” recalls Jenna. “And so then I always had a — very well-meaning, but nosy — relative, always coming into the bedroom, just putting laundry away, whenever I was on the phone with Arthur.”  “Which I would hear in the background, by the way, when we would be talking,” adds Arthur. “I’d suddenly hear, ‘Can you see me? I’m the pretty aunt.’”  Jennea was set to return to Mozambique early in the new year. She still had another 12 months of her Peace Corps contract. It wasn’t obvious where this connection with Arthur would or could go. But then Arthur invited Jennea to visit him in London for a couple of days before she returned.  “My mom was like, ‘Absolutely not. He could be an axe murderer. You just don’t know,’” says Jennea. “While my aunt was saying, ‘You’re just young once, and you only live once, so take a chance and see what happens.’”  Jennea tried not to be swayed by either of their opinions.  “I mean, as an adult, I was able to make my own decisions,” she points out.  Jennea knew she wanted to see Arthur again. So she got the train back from Cambridge to London, where Arthur was waiting, smiling, in the station concourse.  “We were in London together for just 24 hours,” says Arthur. “It was quite special. We were able to squeeze basically lots of different dates into that period of time.”  It was the end of December — that time between Christmas and the new year when many people in the UK are off work, the Christmas lights are still twinkling and there’s a sense of expectation in the air as January 31 gets ever closer. It was the perfect backdrop for falling in love.  “It was a very magical day,” says Jennea. “We went to different restaurants, museums, and saw a show.”  Arthur had planned out the whole day.  “And all the things that he had planned, they were things that I really enjoy doing as well,” says Jennea. “So there was this thought of, ‘What you like doing is what I like doing,.’”  “It was just one day in London. But it really sealed the deal.”  Arthur felt the same way, saying this time together, “helped establish a strong bond.”  But when Jennea left for Mozambique, she and Arthur promised to take “everything one day at a time.”  Neither of them had been looking for romance when they met. And both were conscious that Jennea living on another continent would be tough to navigate.  “My approach to it was, ‘If I keep talking to Arthur, that’s wonderful, and that’s great. And if not, I had a great time. Everything was lovely,’” says Jennea.  “And so I think because I wasn’t expecting and hoping and putting that pressure on, it always remained a very safe space, if that makes sense — super organic. It was just very relaxed, one day at a time without the pressure and I think the distance permitted that — but also knowing that the distance was temporary, I think that’s a really important mixture in starting a long-distance relationship.”  Jennea and Arthur kept in touch while she was away via regular phone calls.  “We would call and chat, building the relationship and getting to know each other,” says Jennea. “I looked forward to those phone calls. We’d ask: ‘What are your hopes and dreams for the future? What’s your family like? Do you have siblings? Happiest memory…’ That kind of thing… And also just, ‘How do you like your toast?’”  “Jennea was someone that liked going into depth on different things,” says Arthur. “And also someone I could laugh with. Someone with a sense of humor. I think that was very appealing.”  A few months in, Arthur visited Jennea in Mozambique in spring 2015.  “It was surreal when I saw Arthur again,” recalls Jennea. “I couldn’t believe he traveled across the world to come and visit me. I traveled six hours via public transport to meet him at the Nampula airport so it’s safe to say we were both feeling a little more invested in our relationship at that point.”  Jennea waited for Arthur at the airport holding “a giant homemade welcome sign for him in Dutch.”  The Mozambique visit was really exciting for both Arthur and Jennea, and further confirmed their certainty in the relationship and its potential future.  “It gave me a deep appreciation for the volunteering Jennea did, which really was a defining experience for her,” says Arthur.  And as the months rolled on, Jennea started considering what she’d do after her Peace Corps contract ended. She was interested in teaching, but wasn’t sure where she’d end up based.  “My original plan was to return to the US and to go into graduate school. And in the United States, you have to take an entrance exam in order to get into graduate school. So I convinced myself that it would be worth it to go to London and take this exam, because then I could stay with Arthur,” says Jennea.  In the moment, Jennea told herself — and everyone else in her life — that she was saving money by not having to pay for hotel accommodation, even though she could have done the exam somewhere closer and saved the plane fare.  “It was an excuse,” Jennea says. “I wasn’t fooling anyone. But then I went to London and stayed with Arthur for two weeks.”  During that period, Jennea talked to Arthur about her graduate school plans, and interest in teaching, but mentioned nothing was set in stone.  “I’m open to various options,” she told him.  “Well, you know, London is an option,” said Arthur.  Jennea raised an eyebrow, not sure what to make of this.  “I remember thinking, ‘What does that mean? I’m fully aware that I could move to London, but are you asking me to live with you?’” she says today. “And yes, that was his very romantic way of saying, ‘Will you live with me? London’s an option.’”  Life in London  After Jennea introduced Arthur to her extended family during a Minnesota-based Thanksgiving at the end of 2014 — a trip she calls “a lot of fun” — she made the choice to move to the UK to be with Arthur.  This decision was made a little easier thanks to Jennea’s mother’s Irish roots.  “Fortunately, I have dual-citizenship with Ireland and the USA,” she says. “I was therefore spared any visa hardships, luckily.”  And at the beginning of 2015, she moved into Arthur’s apartment in Poplar, east London — which he’d just purchased.  “The wallpaper was a bit 1970s, so we had this shared project of updating this flat together, and I think for us living together for the first time in this big city, and adjusting, it was helpful, because I wasn’t moving into his space right away. We were both starting out in this new space,” Jennea says.  “We were building new memories together, in a new area,” adds Arthur.  Jennea and Arthur moved in together in London in 2015. MoMi Photo  The couple also adopted a cat from Battersea Cats and Dogs Home, an animal rescue center in London.  “That was also really nice, because we had our little friend, and it was nice to come home to him,” says Jennea, who started training to become an elementary school teacher not long after she moved to the UK.  Life in London was an adjustment from her time in the Peace Corps — and living in the UK was also different from Jennea’s childhood in the US. But her Cambridge family weren’t too far away. And Jennea was excited to create her own family unit with Arthur.  “We were just very easy together,” she says. “It just felt cozy. It felt like home when we were together. I found security.”  When Jennea moved to London, she and Arthur and just celebrated their one year “meet-a-versary,” as she calls it.  As a gift, Arthur gave Jennea a ceramic tile, a type of traditional Dutch pottery, with a personalized inscription: “A phrase in Dutch that translates to, “The measurement of love is love without measurement.”  Underneath the words was the date Arthur and Jennea first met: December 15, 2013.  Proposal and marriage  Jennea and Arthur on their wedding day in Curacao. Arthur calls the day ""incredible and very memorable."" Claudia Sanches/Wow Wedding Details  After a couple of years enjoying London life, Arthur proposed to Jennea while they were on vacation in Bruges, Belgium.  “Arthur proposed after giving me a heartfelt letter about his love for me and got down on one knee,” says Jennea.  In the spring of 2017, Jennea and Arthur got married in Curacao, a Dutch Caribbean island.  “We chose a place that inconvenienced guests equally,” jokes Jennea before adding that they were attracted to the beauty of the island, and the fact it was “neither a ‘his’ nor ‘hers’ wedding destination.”  It was, says Arthur, “incredible and very memorable — having all of our closest family and friends in Curacao for a four day party.”  “For the entire week, when we walked down the street we always bumped into friends or family,” recalls Jennea.  “The day itself was sunny, clear blue skies and warm. I had had a sleepover with the bridesmaids/girls the night before and I was ready to party and say yes to living the rest of my life with Arthur by my side. It was just such a great buzz.”  The speeches included a couple of mentions of Arthur and Jennea’s unlikely train station meeting — including three of Arthur’s friends performing a little skit about the meeting, and the couple’s life together since.  “I have a lot of happy memories of that day. It’s definitely a moment in time I like to relive and enjoy,” says Jennea.  Arthur says he also felt “deeply happy” and also really “grateful” to be marrying Jennea.  Tougher times  From the early days of their relationship, Arthur and Jennea had talked about wanting children. The couple first discussed this mutual desire on one of their many long, in-depth cross-continental phone calls.  They figured once they were married, and more settled with careers and life, they’d start trying for kids.  “But this turned out to be very difficult,” says Jennea. “We really struggled with infertility, and that was something that was really hard, because everything else was so easy between us. When we started trying for kids, it just kind of felt ‘What’s wrong?’ This life we had envisioned together — it wasn’t necessarily clear whether or not we would ever have that.”  As the uncertainty and heartbreak stretched over several years, Jennea and Arthur navigated the ups and downs as a team.  “We’d be open about the challenges, having those conversations emotionally,” says Arthur. “But then also not being stuck in that anxiety or concern or frustration, but trying to convert that into, ‘Where do we go from here, together?’”  Arthur also credits the couple’s “wider social circle, family and friends” who helped support them through this period.  And then, in 2020, Jennea and Arthur had a successful round of IVF, welcoming a daughter.  “We got very lucky,” says Jennea.  A few years later, in summer 2023, the couple had a second child, a son.  “We have another little baby, also with the help of IVF,” says Jennea. “We just feel very fortunate to have what we have now.”  Life today  Jennea, Arthur and their two kids now live in the Netherlands. Arthur and Jennea  Today, Jennea and Arthur live in the Hague, in the Netherlands, with their two young children. The couple moved to Arthur’s home country when they became parents.  This was partly a career decision after Britain left the European Union, and partly a personal decision.  “Arthur’s career was moved from London to Amsterdam following Brexit, and then Arthur’s family also lives here,” explains Jennea. “So as I was pregnant and about to give birth, the thought was, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be nice to be closer to Arthur’s immediate family?’”  Today, says Jennea, the couple are nostalgic about their London life — “all the museums, going for drinks with your friends — there’s just so much going on in London, how could you not love it?”  They always enjoy returning — especially to King’s Cross station, where it all began.  “Kings Cross station definitely holds a special place in our hearts,” says Jennea. “We always hold hands and kiss when we walk through together. When we brought our daughter there the first time, that was a magical moment. I’m looking forward to bringing our son there in the future.”  It’s that wonderful festive energy, the exciting chaos, that engulfs the days leading up to Christmas that I associate with our love story. Jennea  Over a decade later, Jennea says she still thinks “meeting at a train station is romantic. It feels nostalgic in a way, like an old movie meet-cute.”  Jennea and Arthur also always associate the month of December with their love story.  “It’s that wonderful festive energy, the exciting chaos, that engulfs the days leading up to Christmas that I associate with our love story,” she says.  The couple always take a moment to “set aside time to be with just each other at this point in the year, and tell each other just how grateful we are that we met,” adds Jennea.  “To our friends/family, it has been compared to a Bollywood scene,” says Arthur, who adds he has a strong feeling that bumping into Jennea that day was “meant to be.”  “I honestly still count myself incredibly lucky because it was so serendipitous,” agrees Jennea.  “If things had gone to ‘plan’ — no delayed plane or luggage, not having missed my original trains to Cambridge, etc. I never would have met Arthur. Our paths just wouldn’t have crossed. We were living in two totally different worlds and this really feels like it was fate. Eleven years later, we’re still together and with two kids, all due to a chance encounter on a train platform.”"
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/science/december-full-moon/index.html,CNN,left,Trending,December full moon will shine bright this weekend. Here’s how to best view it,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  As the winter nights grow longer, those in the Northern Hemisphere will want to keep an eye out this weekend for the last full moon of the year. The silvery orb will shine bright in the sky for a hair more than 16 hours on Saturday evening into Sunday morning.  Known as the long night moon or the cold moon, it’s set to reach peak illumination at 4:02 a.m. ET Sunday, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. However, the moon will appear round to the naked eye for about three days, according to NASA.  For those in the Southern Hemisphere, which had a long visibility moon in June, the December full moon will appear for a shorter time and will follow a lower arch in the sky, said Sara Russell, research scientist and head of the Planetary Materials Group at London’s Natural History Museum.  “For those of us in the northern hemisphere, the Moon will seem to reach higher in the sky than you might expect,” Russell said in an email.  The sun, moon and Earth are on about the same plane, with the full moon occurring when Earth is between the moon and the sun as the moon orbits our planet. “In December, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, the Sun is low and has a short track across the sky, so the opposite Moon has a high and long track,” Russell added.  Observing the cold moon  The cold moon’s name is a nod to the bitter weather typically found in the Northern Hemisphere this time of year. The name comes from the Mohawk people, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac, which has names for each full moon that historically derive from Native Americans, Colonial Americans or other sources.  For best viewing of the cold moon, Russell recommended looking when it has just risen or is about to set to see it near the horizon. Wrap up in warm layers if you’re in colder weather and aim to look when there are clear skies in your area, she said.  “We are so lucky on Earth to have the Moon. There’s nowhere else in our Solar system where there is a planet and moon so proportionately close in size — the Moon is almost like our smaller twin,” Russell said. “It is better at preserving all of its history than is the surface of the Earth, and we can look up to its cratered surface to see how battered by impacts both the Moon and Earth have been over their 4.5 billion-year history.”  Those observing the moon can ponder the questions yet to be answered about the neighboring celestial object, such as the mysteries surrounding the far side of the moon, theories about the water-rich lunar poles or the possibility of humans one day living on permanent bases there, Russell said.  Upcoming celestial events  This year, the December full moon occurs one week before the winter solstice, an astronomical event caused by the Earth’s tilt, that marks the Northern Hemisphere’s longest night and shortest day and vice versa for the Southern Hemisphere.  This year’s winter solstice, when Earth’s axis is tilted the farthest away from the sun, will be at 4:21 a.m. ET December 21, according to EarthSky.  The next full moon will be the wolf moon on January 25, according to the Farmers’ Almanac.  Meanwhile, there are two meteor showers to close out the year; the Geminids will be seen blazing in the night sky until the shower’s finality on December 21, while the Ursids will peak December 21-22, according to the American Meteor Society."

Don’t cancel your flight just yet,"Editor’s note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.  CNN —  In travel news this week: the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards, why you shouldn’t gift-wrap methamphetamine, plus infrastructure megaprojects around the world.  Bridge and tunnel crowd  There’s been a whole bunch of international infrastructure projects in the news this week, with a strong focus on digging.  Busy beavers and merry moles have been chattering about resurfaced plans for a $20 trillion transatlantic tunnel that could theoretically link London and New York in just an hour using vacuum tube technology. That’s 3,000 miles of burrowing, mind, which Newsweek estimates could take the best part of a millennium if construction proceeded at the same rate as Europe’s Channel Tunnel.  In plans that are actually happening, Norway broke ground last month on its Rogfast project, which promises to be the world’s longest, deepest undersea road tunnel. Elsewhere in northern Europe, the world’s longest road and rail tunnel, the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel between Denmark and Germany, is slated to open in 2029.  Southern Europe isn’t shy of a project or two, either. Construction of a new bridge linking Greece and Turkey might be closer to getting underway, the Greek Reporter said Friday.  Over near the western end of Europe, the UK is busy building one of the world’s most expensive railway projects, known as HS2 (High Speed 2), which now costs an almighty $416 million per mile. However, many people think it’s pointless.  That comes a few years after the UK resurfaced plans for what would have been one of the world’s most ambitious bridges, linking Britain and Ireland. It was to cross just a 12-mile stretch, but the waters were deep enough to submerge the Eiffel Tower. Then there was the matter of all the radioactive waste and unexploded munitions. Unsurprisingly, plans were dropped.  Baggage blues  A top musician who played at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was forced to cancel a concert this week after Air Canada refused to give his multi-million-dollar cello a seat on the plane.  For others, the trouble only starts at the baggage carousel, although there’s progress on easing some of the pain of that. United Airlines has rolled out a new way to track lost luggage with AirTags, with users being able to share location information directly with the airline. Other carriers, including Delta, Lufthansa and Qantas, are set to follow suit.  Finally, Japan Airlines has announced a baggage delivery service for travelers that will allow luggage to be dropped off at customers’ hotels for a fee. The idea is to reduce overcrowding on Tokyo’s public transport.  Naughty or nice?  It’s always a bad idea to put wrapped Christmas presents in your airplane luggage – if they raise concerns with airport security, they’re likely to be unwrapped.  It’s an even worse idea when the “presents” are actually 10 kilos of methamphetamine, as happened at a New Zealand airport this week.  This Christmas, we hope that your holidays are not felonious, but felicitous — like American Jennea and Dutchman Arthur.  Jennea’s flight from Mozambique was delayed and she missed her train out of London to see her loved ones for Christmas. Then she met her future husband on the platform.  Should you have the misfortune of finding yourself similarly in the winter chill this holiday season, but without the comfort of a lover’s hand to hold, you can always console yourself with a pair of heated gloves.

Barrie, echoing a sentiment long expressed by the human race in an effort to cheat death.  The quest to unlock the secrets of longevity has been the topic of scientific study for decades. And some of the greatest lessons about living a long life come from nature itself.  Take Jonathan the giant tortoise, for instance. It is believed that the tortoise, a resident of the remote South Atlantic island of St. Helena, was likely born in 1832 — but he may be more than 200 years old since the exact date of his birth remains unknown.  Although blind and lacking a sense of smell, Jonathan still has sharp hearing for his advanced age and sunbathes during mild weather.  But even though giant tortoises are known for their exceptionally long lives, they may be outranked by an elusive creature of the deep.  Ocean secrets  A Greenland shark is seen swimming beneath the ice near northern Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. Avalon.red/Alamy Stock Photo  The rarely seen Greenland shark is a sluggish creature, slowly swimming through the deep waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The polar fish is the only species of shark that can withstand the freezing temperatures year-round.  The large sharks also live to be more than 400 years old, and some of them may have been alive since colonial times.  After mapping and studying their extraordinary genomes, scientists think the sharks’ unusually long lifespans are rooted in their unique genetic makeup — with insights that could be used to extend human lifespans.  Other worlds  The “Black Beauty” meteorite opened a window into studying ancient Mars when it was found in the Sahara Desert in 2011.  Astronomers believe the space rock was ejected from the Martian surface 5 million to 10 million years ago. And now, a single mineral grain inside the meteorite has revealed the oldest direct evidence of water on Mars 4.45 billion years ago.  The mineral grain was altered by hot water on Mars, which suggests that habitable environments such as hot springs may have existed on the red planet early in its history.  Meanwhile, the Perseverance rover just completed its 3 ½-month ascent up the steep rim of Jezero Crater on Mars, spotting an unusual zebra-striped rock along the way. Next up? The robotic explorer will investigate the oldest rocks on Mars to uncover more about the planet’s mysterious past.

Tess Crowley/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images  With distinctive orange-and-black wings, monarch butterflies are easy to spot as they flit among the flowers, helping pollinate plants and encouraging biodiversity.  But monarch populations have seen a steep decline due to insecticides, habitat loss and the climate crisis — troubling enough that the US Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed adding the fragile species to the threatened species list.  If the butterflies receive the designation, more action could be taken to protect the important pollinators. But officials warn that without action, monarchs could vanish before the end of the century with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems.  Fantastic creatures  When a creature washed ashore in New Zealand in July, experts wondered whether it might be a spade-toothed whale, the world’s rarest whale that’s considered to be almost mythical because it has never been seen alive at sea.  Now, scientists studying the remains have confirmed the “really stocky, powerful-looking little animal” is indeed one of the elusive marine mammals, said Anton van Helden, an expert on some of the world’s rarest whales.  The carcass, studied by whale scientists and members of the local Māori community, yielded precious clues about the deep-sea-diving animal.

Tom Björklund/Max Planck Institute  Ancient DNA retrieved from bone fragments found in a cave beneath a medieval castle have helped scientists pinpoint when prehistoric humans encountered Neanderthals and made babies with them.  The bones belonged to a mother, daughter and distant cousins who lived in what’s now eastern Germany about 45,000 years ago. Their genomes revealed evidence of Neanderthal ancestry, meaning that early Homo sapiens living in the region mated with Neanderthals 1,500 years earlier.  “We were far more similar than we were different,” said Priya Moorjani, assistant professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley.  “They seem to have mixed with each other for a long period of time.”  In addition to shedding light on the shared history between humans and Neanderthals, the study also showed that the fragments belonged to a lost branch of the human family tree.

Police were called to a bar in Victoria in central London – a short walk from the palace – on Tuesday evening when a festive celebration turned violent.  A 24-year-old woman, who has not been identified, was arrested on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and of being drunk and disorderly, London’s Metropolitan Police told CNN.  The woman, who subsequently spent Tuesday night and much of the following day in a police cell, is believed to be a maid at the palace and was on a night out with around 50 members of palace staff at the time, according to The Sun newspaper.

She reportedly smashed some glasses and turned on a member of the bar staff.  Management at the royal residence say the matter is now being investigated and that disciplinary action could follow.  A palace spokesperson told the BBC: “We are aware of an incident outside the workplace involving a number of Household staff who had previously attended an early evening reception at the Palace.  “While this was an informal social gathering, not an official Palace Christmas party, the facts will be fully investigated, with a robust disciplinary process followed in relation to individual staff and appropriate action taken.”  The spokesperson told the BBC that the post-reception drinks, which staff went on to at the bar, were informal and had not been arranged by the palace.  A palace spokesperson confirmed the statement to CNN.  A spokesperson for London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed the incident to CNN in an email, saying: “At 21:21hrs on Tuesday, 10 December officers were called to a bar in Victoria Street, SW1 following reports that a customer had smashed glasses and attempted to assault a member of staff.  “Officers attended and arrested a 24-year-old woman on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly.  “She was taken into custody and released the following evening having been given a penalty notice for disorder.”"
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/world/israel-syria-golan-mount-hermon/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Why Israel captured Syria’s tallest mountain just hours after Assad fell,"CNN —  Israel wasted no time after Bashar al-Assad’s fall to bomb all the Syrian military assets it wanted to keep out of the rebels’ hands – striking nearly 500 targets, destroying the navy, and taking out, it claims, 90% of Syria’s known surface-to-air missiles.  But it is Israel’s capture of Syria’s highest peak, the Mount Hermon summit, that may prove among the most lasting prizes – though officials have insisted that its occupation is temporary.  “This is the highest place in the region, looking upon Lebanon, upon Syria, Israel,” said Efraim Inbar, director of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS). “It’s strategically extremely important. There is no substitute for mountains.”  Israeli armored vehicles at the demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights. Matias Delacroix/AP  The summit of Mount Hermon lies in Syria, in a buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces for fifty years until last weekend, when Israeli troops took control of it. Until Sunday, the summit was demilitarized and patrolled by UN peacekeepers – their highest permanent position in the world.  Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, on Friday ordered the military to prepare for the harsh conditions of winter deployment. “Due to developments in Syria, it is of immense security importance to maintain our control over the summit of Mount Hermon,” he said in a statement.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has advanced beyond the summit, as far as Beqaasem, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Syrian capital, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. CNN could not independently confirm that claim. An Israeli military spokesperson this week denied that forces were “advancing toward” Damascus.  Israeli artillery on Mount Hermon in 1974. Alain Dejean/Sygma/Getty Images  Israel captured the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau in southwestern Syria that abuts Mount Hermon, in the 1967 war and has occupied it since. Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981. The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration.  Israel has for decades held some lower slopes of Mount Hermon, and even operates a ski resort there, but the peak remained in Syria proper.  “We have no intention to intervene in Syria’s internal affairs,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video days after Israel bombed hundreds of Syrian targets and seized the demilitarized buffer zone. “But we certainly intend to do everything necessary to take care of our security.”  Mount Hermon’s summit is a tremendous asset under Israel’s control. At 9,232 feet (2,814 meters), it is higher than any point in Syria or Israel, and second to only one peak in Lebanon.  “People sometimes say in the age of missiles, land is not important – it’s simply untrue,” Inbar said.  In an academic paper published in 2011, he wrote of the many advantages presented by Mount Hermon.  “It enables the use of electronic surveillance deep into Syrian territory, giving Israel early-warning capacity in case of an impending attack,” he wrote. Advanced technological alternatives like airborne surveillance, he argued, was simply not comparable. “In contrast to an installation on a mountain, these cannot carry heavy equipment such as big antennas, and they can be shot down by anti-air missiles.”  Israeli military forces on Mount Hermon on Sunday. Social Media  The peak is just over 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) from Damascus, which means that control of its Syrian foothills – also now in IDF hands – put the Syrian capital within range for artillery cannons.  The Israeli prime minister has said his “hand is extended” to the new government in Syria. But in the post-October 7 world, he and other national security heavyweights have made clear they are not going to take any chances.  “Mostly, it’s a comfort for us,” retired Brigadier General Israel Ziv said of Israel’s operations in Syria. “We have learned what happened in other countries when you have a terror organization that captures military equipment.”  Netanyahu has also insisted that the occupation is temporary. “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7 style attacks,” he said. His criteria for withdrawing, he said, was a Syrian force “that is committed to the 1974 agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed.”  It is unclear when that may be achieved.  Whether the military withdraws “is a political decision,” Inbar said. “The military would love to stay there.”  Mike Schwartz and Tim Lister contributed to this report."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/middleeast/can-islamist-rebels-govern-syria-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Can Syria’s Islamist rebels govern the country? Their rule in Idlib offers clues,"CNN —  When Syria’s rebel-appointed prime minister sat down with officials from the ousted Assad regime for the first time on Tuesday, the backdrop included the flag of the Syrian revolution alongside another bearing the Islamic declaration of faith that is often displayed by jihadists.  The choice of optics for the rebels’ first publicized cabinet meeting to discuss the transition of power since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime sparked controversy, with sceptics taking to social media to criticize the move.  The rebels may have taken note. In a later televised interview with Al Jazeera, caretaker Prime Minister Mohammad Al Bashir, who until this week ruled the small, conservative province of Idlib on the rebels’ behalf, appeared only with the new Syrian flag.  How the rebels governed Idlib, in northwest Syria, offers insight into how they might rule the country. Experts and residents of Idlib describe their governance as pragmatic and influenced by both internal and external pressure, with efforts to distance themselves from a jihadist past and gain international acceptance. However, their rule was far from democratic or liberal. Governing a large, diverse nation like Syria, they warn, will be an entirely different challenge.  Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that led the rebel offensive to topple the Assad regime and is proscribed as a terrorist organization by the United States, has opted to rule from the shadows. Jolani, who now uses his real name Ahmad al-Sharaa, picked a technocrat – Bashir – to lead Syria in the interim. He has said his officials gained valuable experience while governing Idlib but acknowledged that may not be enough.  “They (rebels) started from nothing, Idlib is small and without resources but thank God we were able to do really good things in the past… their experience is not zero and there are (areas) they were successful in,” Jolani told Mohammed Jalali, Assad’s prime minister, in a meeting on Monday to discuss the transfer of power. “However, we cannot do without the old (guard) and we have to benefit from them.”  Syrian caretaker Prime Minister Mohamed al-Bashir attends a meeting with the transitional cabinet after Syrian rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday. AL ARABIYA TV/Reuters  In just 13 days, Jolani’s ministers went from ruling the small province of Idlib to aspiring to govern Syria following its first regime change in six decades. Experts and residents who lived under the rebel-led Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) say the inexperienced cabinet will need to significantly adapt if they are to lead the transitional period effectively.  Dr. Walid Tamer, a resident of Idlib who witnessed the province’s transformation under rebel rule and said he personally interacted with Jolani, commended the SSG’s governance in Idlib, saying freedom of expression was protected. But he cautioned that the rebels aren’t prepared to rule the rest of the country.  “You went from governing Idlib to governing an entire nation… I don’t think the capabilities of the government we saw are enough for the task of governing the whole of Syria,” said Tamer, the head of northern Syria’s Free Doctors Union who describes himself as a liberal.  Idlib was “very safe” under the SSG, he said, adding that the rebels placed no restrictions on travel and movement inside the HTS-controlled province.  “Syria as a whole was a difficult place to live in, but the (SSG) never interfered in your personal life. Products were available and no limitations were imposed on your clothing or how you lived your life,” he said.  Life in the province was not one of prosperity, however. Abdel Latif Zakoor, a resident of Idlib who lived under rebel rule but has now moved to Turkey, told CNN the economic conditions under the SSG were “very difficult.”  “There wasn’t enough work, and a lot of people just stayed at home,” he said.  Taking control  When Jolani expanded his influence in Idlib in 2017, he eliminated rival Islamist groups and backed a new project to install a civilian government made up of local technocrats and academics, breaking from other jihadist methods that saw religious coercion under the rule of the sword in territories they captured.  “Before the Salvation Government you had many different factions that had their own courts of justice, prisons and social services,” Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst who has researched HTS for the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think tank, told CNN. “It imposed itself on other factions and took out their governing responsibilities.”  Displaced Syrians arrive from Lebanon to Idlib on October 10. In the center of the picture, the minister of interior in the Syrian Salvation Government, affiliated with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Muhammad Abd al-Rahman, appears as he inspects the registration procedures for displaced Syrians fleeing Lebanon. Ghaith Alsayed/Getty Images  Upon its establishment in 2017, the SSG issued a communique outlining four principles, one of which was that Islamic Sharia law is the “sole source of legislation,” emphasizing the need to “maintain the people’s Syrian and Islamic identity,” Al Jazeera reported.  The SSG operated as a functional government, holding publicized cabinet meetings with suited officials, issuing press statements and overseeing eleven ministries, including justice, sports, and education. It collected taxes, managed Idlib’s limited resources to govern 4 million people, and coordinated with international humanitarian groups to deliver aid to the 3 million displaced people in the region.  But the government wasn’t democratically elected, with ministers appointed through the approval of the shura, or consultative council, made up of prominent local figures, some of whom were selected by Jolani’s HTS. No women served in SSG leadership positions during its seven years of rule.  “It’s an Islamic governance in a technocratic way. What they wanted to do is control how religion is understood and how it’s implemented,” said Drevon.  A United Nations report from 2022 painted a grim picture of what life under HTS’ leadership was like.  “People were detained following comments made in private conversations pertaining to the cost of living or religious matters,” the UN Human Rights Council report on Syria said. “These comments were qualified as slander and blasphemy, with the latter leading to a sentence of one year of imprisonment.” Authorities “continued to arrest women for being ‘inappropriately’ dressed, and for non-compliance with entertainment-related bans.”  Tamer, who said he negotiated with HTS and SSG officials over medical matters, said that over the years, Jolani took a back seat in the daily affairs of the government and gave it more agency, only intervening on larger issues that endangered his group’s influence.  Rule by decree  Lacking a constitution or an elected legislature, the rebels ruled Idlib by decree, setting up a hybrid civil-Islamic court structure that included defense lawyers, a prosecutor and an appeals process.  Jolani was pragmatic in adapting to the requirements of the society he ruled over, Drevon said. Responding to the public’s displeasure, he slowly phased out the strict application of Islamic law, turned a blind eye to gender mixing and smoking and allowed protests against him. A Sharia law-based morality unit was disbanded but women were encouraged to cover their hair.  “It was a successful project in practice because there was also some buy in from the population. It was stable, the economy was working better (than the rest of Syria) and even the type of authoritarianism was nothing compared to Assad’s family,” Drevon said.  But there were exceptions. Last year, the SSG issued a “morality decree” instructing children to adhere to an Islamic dress code and limiting music in educational facilities. Jolani intervened to freeze the decree, fearing that an international uproar could affect aid donations, Drevon said.  Another issue was the arrest and alleged torture of dissidents that caused significant protests against Jolani in Idlib last year. Jolani told CNN last week that abuses in prisons “were not done under our orders or directions” and that HTS had already penalized the perpetrators.  Drevon said that Syria’s transition to democracy is going to be a lengthy and complicated process after six decades of dictatorship.  “It was a very new form of governance (in Idlib),” he said. “You can’t expect an armed group in war controlling a region that’s very tiny to create a social democratic system… They had to be realistic on what’s possible at war. Syria hasn’t had democracy in five, six decades. You will not become democratic in one week.”"

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/europe/lutsenko-ukraine-replaces-commander-russia-intl-latam/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Ukraine replaces commander following Russian advances on key city of Pokrovsk,"CNN —  The commander of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk group of forces has been replaced following Russian advances in the region, a military official said Saturday.  General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy would take over as head of the operational and tactical group, replacing General Oleksandr Lutsenko, the official told CNN.  The move comes after Lutsenko faced heavy criticism for failing to stop recent Russian advances on the key city of Pokrovsk.  Russian forces have been spotted just three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the city, according to Ukrainian mapping service DeepState.  Pokrovsk has been the site of some of the fiercest battles on the eastern front for months, as Russia attempts to close in on the city.  Lying around 11 miles from Ukraine’s Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, it is a strategic target for Moscow.  Its fall to Russian forces would mark the largest setback for Ukraine in months and compound Ukraine’s struggles to get off the backfoot while Russian troops pile severe pressure on the eastern front lines.  Losing it would also add to the anxiety Ukraine’s military faces over the looming Donald Trump presidency in the United States, which has raised the risk that military aid from Kyiv’s largest source could dry up as the grinding conflict approaches its fourth year.  Elsewhere in the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that Moscow’s forces had begun to deploy a “significant” number of North Korean soldiers in its effort to drive Ukraine’s army out of Russia’s Kursk region.  Ukraine launched an incursion into Kursk in August and still retains some settlements there.  “Today, there is already preliminary evidence that the Russians have begun to use soldiers from North Korea in assaults – a significant number of them,” Zelensky said.  “The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in the Kursk region,” Zelensky said, adding there had already been “noticeable” losses among these soldiers.  He added that Ukraine had information that North Korean soldiers may be being used along other parts of the front line."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/asia/south-korea-yoon-second-impeachment-hnk-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,South Korea’s parliament votes to impeach president over martial law debacle,"Seoul, South Korea CNN —  South Korea’s parliament voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday in an extraordinary rebuke that came about after his own ruling party turned on him following his refusal to resign over his short-lived martial law attempt.  It is the second time in less than a decade that a South Korean leader has faced impeachment proceedings in office and means Yoon is suspended from exercising his powers until the decision is finally adjudicated by the country’s Constitutional Court.  Following the vote, which sparked jubilation among protesters outside parliament, Yoon conceded that he will “stop temporarily for now, but the journey to the future that I’ve walked with the people for the past two years should not stop.”  “I will not give up,” he said in a statement shared by the country’s presidential office.  “With all the encouragement and support for me in mind, I will do my best until the last moment for the nation,” he added.  The country’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who will serve as acting president under South Korean law, told reporters that he would “devote all my strength and effort to stable operation of state affairs.”  Kang Sun-woo, a lawmaker with the Democratic Party, told CNN Saturday that the “great democracy of South Korea will survive and will be born again” after the impeachment.  The dramatic decision marks the culmination of a stunning political showdown after Yoon briefly declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers to parliament, where lawmakers fought past troops to enter the building and vote down the decree.  Yoon’s gamble backfired spectacularly, galvanizing many in the vibrant Asian democracy to call for his removal.  Opposition parties tried impeaching him a week ago – but Yoon survived after members of his ruling People Power Party boycotted the vote, saying they hoped the president would voluntarily resign instead.  Yoon then doubled down – giving a defiant speech on Thursday in which he defended his martial law decision, lambasted the opposition, claimed he was trying to save the country and vowed to “fight until the last moment with the people.”  Yet moments before that speech, the leader of Yoon’s party withdrew his support for the president and backed impeachment as the “only way… to defend democracy”, instructing lawmakers to vote with their conscience.  Thousands of protesters gathered in Seoul on Saturday, braving the cold to call for Yoon to resign ahead of the vote, which was passed by 204 lawmakers with 85 voting against it.  “He surely tried to have a war against the citizens so this is just what he deserved,” one protestor, Lim Dong Eon, told CNN outside the National Assembly building after the vote, where protesting has now turned into partying.  Another protestor kept their message short, telling CNN: “Democracy is back!”  Protesters participate in a rally calling for Yoon's impeachment in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14. Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters  People celebrate after the South Korean parliament passed an impeachment motion against Yoon on December 14. Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters  Meanwhile, thousands of the president’s supporters gathered in downtown Seoul, with many waving US and South Korean flags, chanting slogans and holding up signs in support of the embattled Yoon.  Yoon, who has been immediately suspended of his powers, now awaits a ruling by the Constitutional Court – one of the country’s highest courts – to confirm his fate, which can take up to six months.  Acting chief justice of the Constitutional Court, Moon Hyung-bae, said in a statement Saturday that a meeting will take place on Monday to discuss the case schedule, adding that the process will be conducted “swiftly and fairly.”  If confirmed, he will become the second South Korean president to be thrown out of office by impeachment after Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female leader.  The now acting president, Han Duck-soo, also faces his own political problems and is being investigated over his role in the martial law decision, adding to the political uncertainty in the weeks ahead.  A former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office, mired in low approval ratings and political scandals involving his wife and political appointments.  Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the Democratic Party, speaks during the plenary session for the impeachment vote at the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14 Woohae Cho/Pool/AFP/Getty Images  Since he took office in 2022 he has also faced political gridlock with an opposition-majority parliament – which prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill.  His administration cracked down what he referred to as “fake news” with police and prosecutors raiding multiple media outlets, including MBC and JTBC, as well as the homes of journalists.  Yoon argued that his frustration with the political deadlock drove him to take a bold power move, surprising not only members of his own party but also many military leaders.  Police raids and treason investigations  In his late-night address declaring martial law, Yoon accused the opposition of “anti-state” activities and being in cahoots with North Korea, without providing evidence – a charge his opponents have strenuously denied. He also portrayed his act as the only way to break the political deadlock in parliament.  But it was met with shock and anger across the country, which remains deeply scarred by the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it transitioned into hard-won democracy in the 1980s.  Dramatic scenes from that night showed security forces breaking through windows in the National Assembly to try and prevent lawmakers from gathering, and protesters confronting riot police.  Soldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on December 4, after Yoon's declaration of martial law. Jung Yeon-je/AFP/Getty Images  Since then, pressure on the president has grown, with police, parliament, prosecutors and the anti-corruption body launching separate investigations into Yoon on treason allegations. On Tuesday, lawmakers approved a special counsel to investigate whether Yoon committed insurrection and abused his power by issuing martial law.  The following day, South Korean police raided the presidential office, a presidential security official confirmed to CNN. Yoon has also been barred from leaving the country.  Last week, South Korean prosecutors detained former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who allegedly recommended the martial law imposition and resigned in the wake of the scandal. Kim attempted to end his own life in custody late Tuesday, according to the head of the country’s correctional service.  On Thursday, Yoon said he had only discussed the martial law decree with Kim before declaring it. Meanwhile parliament has already impeached both Yoon’s justice minister and his police chief.  Senior government officials have testified at various government hearings over the last week revealing some extraordinary details about the night of the martial law order.  Special Warfare Command Commander Kwak Jong-geun testified that he received a direct order from President Yoon to break the doors of the National Assembly and drag out the lawmakers, but he did not comply.  South Korea, one of East Asia’s most important economies and vital US regional ally, now faces months of protracted political uncertainty of the kind that dominated the country during the last impeachment crisis in 2016 and 2017.  Then-president Park Geun-hye was ultimately impeached by lawmakers over corruption allegations, kicked out of office by the Constitutional Court, jailed and later pardoned.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/entertainment/chappell-charli-sabrina-pop-cec/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,"Pop music is messier, for the better, because of Chappell Roan, Charli XCX and Sabrina Carpenter","CNN —  This year brought us new albums from some of the biggest artists in the world: Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift all put out music that thrilled fans.  And yet some of the most impactful pop music of 2024 came not from Tay or Bey, but from three rising pop stars whose songs took us out to the clubs (Pink Pony and otherwise) and back home to the bedroom. They embraced romantic ugliness and cutting self-reflection — and pushed pop forward.  The year arguably belonged to Charli XCX, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter.  “People like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, who’ve dominated for so long — they have a sheen and a polish to them that’s somewhat unrelatable as a listener,” said Sam Murphy, a music curator who analyzes and dissects pop on his popular TikTok account. “What people really craved this year, the TikTok generation, was to see more mess and chaos in people’s lives. We wanted pop stars that we were able to see the flaws within and the charisma coming out.”  The year saw Charli, a boundary-pushing yet oft-overlooked pop veteran, finally escape what the New York Times once called “pop’s middle class” with her defiant, sweat-soaked, goopy-green opus, “Brat.”  This year, Carpenter went from a supporting act on the highest-grossing tour in history to a leading lady herself, with her endearingly silly, sexy songs topping the charts. (Here’s where she’d make a sex joke.)  And it was the year when everyone wanted to take things H-O-T T-O G-O, dance in the Pink Pony Club and wish their exes good luck, babe. Roan’s debut album came out over a year ago, but it rapidly grew an audience this year as she took her act on the road and won us over.  We loved this trio of stars because they weren’t impenetrable like Beyoncé or as towering as Swift. These artists were accessible to us, interacting with fans online and touring prolifically. Their music was personal and specific, with confessional lyrics about self-hatred, unrequited love and lust.  It helps, of course, that their music is exciting and compulsively listenable, said Mike Errico, a musician and visiting assistant arts professor at New York University’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, who teaches songwriting.  “The songs are great. They’re great writers and vocalists, and they’re working with great teams,” Errico said. “ But they also have something very urgent to say.”  None of these women became stars overnight — they’ve been recording music since they were teenagers, steadily building an audience who jibed with their unique sound. Their music doesn’t reinvent pop. But by adding their unique flavors to a well-trodden genre that’s been stuck in a rut of sameness, they’re forcing it into a looser, freer future.  “It’s been a while since there’s been a changing of the guards for people at the top,” Murphy said.  Fans want authenticity — and these artists delivered  Charli XCX belts at a Denmark music festival in July. Joseph Okpako/WireImage/Getty Images  There will always be room for artists like Swift, who’s “etched a place in history that can’t be erased,” Murphy said. But her titanic popularity has led to some “fatigue” among pop fans, he said.  “I think there’s a level of polish that is really reflective of a bygone era of pop that people aren’t relating to,” Murphy said.  Part of why Charli, Roan and Carpenter are so magnetic is because their music wasn’t made for everyone. They weren’t the biggest pop stars in the world when they were writing their breakthrough albums, so they weren’t beholden to an audience of millions. They’ve each cultivated a sound so specific that it can’t be mistaken for anything else.  “The ubiquitous, all-satisfying pop star has disappeared, and instead these niches are becoming bigger and bigger,” Murphy said. “I think that’s why it worked, that push that kept so much on that niche fanbase. It became so big to the point that it was able to start penetrating the mainstream conversation.”  Mainstream, indeed. Some of the biggest songs of the year were made by this pop trifecta. “Espresso,” especially, was inescapable, as Spotify’s most-streamed song globally with over 1.6 billion plays. “Good Luck, Babe!” also scored over one billion streams, and it was Roan’s only new single of the year.  The craving for authentic pop stars reminds Murphy of the “transition from Instagram to TikTok, where your Instagram feed was all about being polished and showing the incredible life that you were leading, even if things were really falling apart behind the scenes.”  On TikTok, meanwhile, users approach their content with inspiring candor, sharing their lives, warts and all, he said.  Charli, Roan and Carpenter take the same approach to their music. Their respective breakout albums, “Brat,” “The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess” and “Short n’ Sweet,” are all deeply personal, vibrant and, crucially, danceable records. That their voices or hearts might break along the way only adds to their considerable charms.  Works from established artists who have a quality and reputation to uphold, like Grande’s “Eternal Sunshine” or Lipa’s “Radical Optimism” — even “Cowboy Carter” and “The Tortured Poets Department,” which are both nominated for album of the year at the Grammys — ”all just got blown out of the water by these moments that felt more exciting,” Murphy said.  Live performances going viral helped artists like Chappell become stars  TikTok virality can turn a song into a hit, but it’s the art of performance that turns an artist into a star.  “I don’t think what happened to Chappell this year (would have) happened without her live stage presence,” Murphy said.  Roan cut her teeth on Olivia Rodrigo’s “Guts” tour earlier this year before joining the lineups of spring and summer musical festivals. We watched as her star rose steadily with every performance: In April, a clip of Roan performing the bridge of “Good Luck, Babe!” dressed in sleazy latex and leather at Coachella won new fans who went back and discovered her debut album. Four months later, at Lollapalooza, she played to the largest crowd in the festival’s history — organizers said as many as 110,000 people may’ve been in her audience.  Chappell Roan, pictured performing in Tennessee in October, had a busy touring schedule this year. With every tour stop, her audience grew. Jason Kempin/Getty Images  “We were watching that growth in real time, in tandem with incredible presentations of her music live,” Murphy said. “It’s difficult to imagine that kind of thing happening even five years ago, pre-pandemic.”  Carpenter’s trajectory was similar, supporting Swift on the Eras Tour before making some festival stops on her own and releasing the smash that introduced us all to the nonsensical phrase “that me espresso.”  These artists are meeting audiences where they’re at, which is, overwhelmingly, on TikTok. Charli and Chappell regularly connect with their fans on the platform, candidly delivering news directly to followers in a video instead of a manager-approved statement.  They also shirk the traditional promotional model of aiming for radio play to grow their fanbases, said music writer Reanna Cruz, who’s written for New York magazine, Rolling Stone and NPR. Now, radio is trying to play catch-up with the young fans it used to influence.  “We’re seeing younger artists that know how to access those hyper-online audiences more effectively have more success,” Cruz said.  We’re living the adjustment to mega-fame with the stars, too. Charli took a victory lap with the remix album “Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat,” on which she warped her original songs into meditations on sudden superstardom. Roan’s public grappling with invasions of privacy sparked conversations about how much stars owe their fans. And clips from Carpenter’s tour routinely go viral, most recently when Marcello Hernandez of “Saturday Night Live” stopped by, in character, as doctor-model-loverboy Domingo.  They have clear POVs that speaks to our time  Over the last decade, hip-hop has reigned as the most popular genre, Cruz and Murphy said, where innovation thrived and stars were reliably discovered. Until this year, pop, with a few exceptions, had been stuck in a rut.  The genre has been suffering from sameness throughout the back-half of the 2010s and into the 2020s, when many artists tried to appeal to all kinds of listeners without carving out their own recognizable sound. There was still room for breakouts like Lipa, Rodrigo and Billie Eilish, plus artists that blended pop and hip-hop, like Doja Cat and SZA, but pop was overwhelmingly plagued by monotony.  Enter Charli, Roan and Carpenter. While their sounds are clearly influenced by earlier acts — “Good Luck, Babe!” builds to a Kate Bush-style bridge; Carpenter’s latest album borrows from Shania Twain and Grande in parts; and Charli has mentioned electronic pioneers like Sophie and titans like Lou Reed and Daft Punk in “Brat” press — it’s their approach to the genre whose rules and boundaries are well-known that make them such exciting artists.  The artists make few compromises in their music. Charli’s beats are tailor-made for the club, with lyrics vacillating between braggadocious bombast to reflections on grief and insecurity. (“Nowadays I only eat at the good restaurants, but honestly I’m always thinkin’ ‘bout my weight,” she sings in “Rewind.”)  Roan’s campy, drag-inspired musical aesthetic has drawn more than a few comparisons to Lady Gaga’s similarly theatrical sound. It lends itself well to songs about hooking up with and falling hard for other women — still a rarity in mainstream pop. (“She did it right there, out on the deck — put her canine teeth in the side of my neck,” goes the first verse of “Red Wine Supernova.”)  Carpenter stuffs a dozen double entendres and innuendos into each deliriously raunchy song on “Short n’ Sweet.” And then sometimes, she drops the artifice and just says what she means: “I’m so f**king horny!” Here’s a pop star plainly confessing and celebrating her lust, something artists like Madonna were once lambasted for. Flirting with cheeky controversy, as with Madonna, has only boosted her profile.  Sabrina Carpenter, pictured at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, has won fans over with her retro pop sensibility and raunchy lyrics. Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty Images  Their music isn’t necessarily political, though Charli, who’s British, famously waded into the conversation when she posted, “kamala IS brat” shortly after the vice president’s candidacy in the US presidential election was announced. But the candid, confident music these pop stars make is meaningful during this turbulent moment, Errico said.  Songs like Charli’s “I think about it all the time,” in which the avowed party girl weighs motherhood, Roan’s various queer love songs and even Carpenter’s lusty, lightweight “Juno,” take on a new gravity at a time when, in the US, bodily autonomy for women and LGBTQ people is fraught and uncertain, Errico said.  “I think they’re sensing the clock turning back, and coming up with hooky, clever ways to say, ‘Over my dead body,’” Errico said. “They’re building a new army for a newly perilous time, while also having a blast.”  The future of pop, Murphy says, is tipping toward honest excess. We saw it this year with Charli transforming massive arenas into sweaty clubs, Roan painting herself with the patina of the Statue of Liberty, Carpenter enraging pearl-clutchers by striking provocative poses on tour. None of the over-the-top flourishes would work, though, without confessional bangers that both transport and ring true.  “People sometimes joke that we’re living in ‘the worst timeline,’ but these artists are determined to throw the best party anyone’s ever tried to shut down,” Errico said."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/federal-government-workers-what-matters/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,How many people work for the federal government?,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.  CNN —  The US grew a lot in the past 40 years.  The US population expanded by about 100 million people  One of them was Vivek Ramaswamy, who was born in 1985 and is one of two wealthy men tasked by President-elect Donald Trump with shrinking the size of the federal government.  Government spending skyrocketed  The US spent around $900 billion in 1984 ($2.7 trillion in 2024 dollars), compared with more than $7 trillion in 2024. Some of that money goes via contracts to Elon Musk, the world’s richest man who is working with Ramaswamy on the Department of Government Efficiency, a new nongovernmental commission.  The national debt has more than exploded  It went from less than $1.6 trillion in 1984 ($4.8 trillion in 2024 dollars) to more than $35.5 trillion today, which should concern every American and is plenty of reason to make any effort to control federal spending a serious and bipartisan push.  Cut federal workers?  The current effort, run by Ramaswamy and Musk, has made a show of eyeing the size of the federal workforce. One percolating idea, according to CNN’s reporting, is that they could recommend firing every federal worker hired in the last year.  Hold on a sec  In those 40 years of explosive population, spending and debt growth, the size of the federal workforce – this is actually kind of shocking – has stayed pretty much the same, confounding the popular presumption that the number of federal workers must have skyrocketed with federal spending.  “The number of federal employees have skyrocketed over the past four years, especially the number that are working from home and not even coming to work,” the House Oversight Committee chairman, Rep. James Comer, told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Thursday, expressing that view.  A closer look at available data shows a variation of a few hundred thousand workers – which seems large but is not a grand expansion of the federal workforce.  Close to 3 million federal civilian workers for decades  There were about 2.96 million civilians, including postal workers, getting full-time paychecks from the federal government at the end of 1984, before Ramaswamy was born, and there are a hair over 3 million working for the federal government today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The official tally from the Office of Personnel Management is a smidge lower, at about 2.87 million, including postal workers.  In fact, the number of full-time federal workers has been relatively static, within a few hundred thousand civilians, since the 1960s.  Even a drawdown of the size of the military and Pentagon during the George H.W. Bush administration and of the federal workforce by hundreds of thousands during the Clinton administration did not markedly change the size of the federal workforce, which has hovered within a few hundred thousand of 3 million workers for decades.  Hundreds of thousands in, hundreds of thousands out every year  Of people who come into and go out of the federal workforce each year, there were hundreds of thousands of civilian employees (not counting postal workers) – about 250,000 to just over 300,000 – newly hired by the federal government in each of the past three years. Those are largely offset by the hundreds of thousands of civilian employees who leave the civil service each year.  Peter Morrissey is the senior director of talent and strategy at The Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for improvements to public service and commissioned a 2017 study to determine the true size of government.  “When you think about the long sweep of it, the number of public servants – people with a .gov email who work for the federal government – has been basically static as the responsibility sets have grown and grown and grown and grown and grown,” he told me. “They serve more people, and they do more stuff.”  Rising costs of social programs like Social Security and Medicare, along with rising costs of material goods, have helped drive government spending.  “People are an absolutely essential part, but in terms of the cost structure, are a comparatively small part,” he said.  In some agencies that Republicans have said they want to shutter, there are relatively few employees – such as the smallest Cabinet-level agency, the Department of Education. It employs about 4,400 employees, according to OPM. The largest federal agencies, like Veterans Affairs and the Pentagon, employ hundreds of thousands of workers.  Most federal workers are not in the DC area  Another thing to know about the federal workforce is that while its largest concentration is in the Washington, DC, metro area, the vast majority, 80%, is spread around the country in every state, but with concentrations in California, Texas, Colorado, Alabama and other states.  Concentrating on improving government might not mean shrinking it, according to Jenny Mattingley, vice president of government affairs at the Partnership for Public Service, which advocates for smarter government.  “What we keep trying to pivot the conversation to is say, let’s make sure we’re fixing government in a way that doesn’t hurt service delivery and doesn’t hurt the American public in terms of getting the things from agencies that they depend on,” she said.  ‘Giant holding company’  The government does indeed do many things. Elaine Kamarck is founding director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, and she helped spearhead an effort to reduce the size of government during the Clinton administration.  She told me it’s important not to view the US government as one monolithic thing, but rather as “essentially a giant holding company.”  “It’s doing everything from training pilots to fly advanced aircraft to tracking down cryptosporidium in your hamburger meat to cutting checks for retired people,” she said.  Firing only the most recent hires, as may be suggested by Musk and Ramaswamy, would have the added impact of scaring away future hires, as well as displacing people hired for specific roles, such as to implement the bipartisan infrastructure law passed during the Biden administration.  Once funded, agencies never go away  But Comer said people hired for specific roles and programs funded once have a tendency to stick around.  “The problem now in government, it’s been the problem for decades … is that you create a government program or create a government agency, it never goes away, even when it becomes obsolete or inefficient,” Comer told Brown on CNN.  The real deep state  On the one hand, the use of contractors and grant employees has risen as those workers, who don’t get a paycheck directly from the government but still do government work, have shouldered more of the burden.  John DiIulio, who worked in both the Barack Obama and George W. Bush administrations, wrote recently that the intersecting system of companies and local officials clamoring for federal dollars represents their own form of a deep state, and deconstructing it will be, he wrote, way harder than rocket science. Here’s an excerpt of what DiIulio wrote:  The citizens of the real deep state stoke nonstop federal deficit spending on everything from Medicare to missiles. They steer funding through intentionally maze-like federal programs. They use federal tax dollars to privately employ millions of people. They are behind the ‘waste, fraud, and abuse’ that everyone typically blames on ‘bureaucrats’ who are mostly mere grant and contract managers in a workforce that has not grown since the 1960s.  Musk, who has built companies on government contracts and subsidies, may be able to offer some insight into how the system works.  How many people actually work for the government, including contractors?  That review of “The True Size of Government” conducted for The Volcker Alliance by researcher Paul Light determined that in 1984, there were more than 6.9 million people working as civilians for the federal government when including contractors and grant employees. Add in the military and postal workers and the figure jumped to 9.8 million.  Intervening years saw a drawdown in the military after the Cold War and then a buildup during the Global War on terror. The study concluded with data from 2015, when there was a total of 9.1 million workers, or 7.3 million without the military or postal service.  Certainly the figure of contract and grant employees must have grown along with major spending bills in the past few years – with the infrastructure bill, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, which earmarked billions to transition the US to a greener economy. Comer said Musk and Ramaswamy, who will take a year and a half to make recommendations, could recommend trying to claw back unspent funds.  “There has been some pressure over years to not increase head count, and that usually leads to greater contracting,” Morrissey said, although there’s evidence that contractors frequently end up costing the government more money.  Everyone I talked to for this story agrees there is plenty of room for bipartisanship in a government efficiency effort to modernize the workforce and improve the way the federal government functions. Both Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Musk have talked about the need to control Pentagon spending, for instance. One complication for Musk will be that his firm SpaceX, in particular, is the recipient of billions in contracts."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process that would have the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items that may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/health/unitedhealth-children-autism-propublica/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,UnitedHealth is strategically limiting access to critical treatment for kids with autism,"This story was originally published by ProPublica.  ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive its biggest stories as soon as they’re published.  There was a time when Sharelle Menard thought her son would never be able to speak. She couldn’t soothe Benji when he cried, couldn’t read him books he could follow, couldn’t take him out in public. “The screaming, and screaming, and screaming,” she said. “He would get so frustrated because he couldn’t communicate.”  Benji was nearly 3 when he was diagnosed with severe autism and soon after started a specialized therapy to help him develop basic skills. After two years in treatment, his murmuring gave way to small words, with “bubbles” among the first. To celebrate, Menard powered up a bubble machine she found at the dollar store, and for hours, they watched the iridescent orbs drift over their porch.  Menard, who is raising Benji alone in south-central Louisiana, began to picture a future for her son that diverged from the stories she’d heard about some kids with similar diagnoses, who grew up still unable to manage their frustrations and had to live in nursing homes or institutions.  But now, she’s worried again.  The insurer that has been paying for her son’s therapy, UnitedHealthcare, has begun — to the befuddlement of his clinical team — denying him the hours they say he requires to maintain his progress. Inside the insurance conglomerate, the nation’s largest and most profitable, the slashing of care to children like Benji does have a reason, though it has little to do with their needs. It is part of a secret internal cost-cutting campaign that targets a growing financial burden for the company: the treatment of thousands of children with autism across the country.  ProPublica has obtained what is effectively the company’s strategic playbook, developed by Optum, the division that manages mental health benefits for United. In internal reports, the company acknowledges that the therapy, called applied behavior analysis, is the “evidence-based gold standard treatment for those with medically necessary needs.” But the company’s costs have climbed as the number of children diagnosed with autism has ballooned; experts say greater awareness and improved screening have contributed to a fourfold increase in the past two decades — from 1 in 150 to 1 in 36.  So Optum is “pursuing market-specific action plans” to limit children’s access to the treatment, the reports said.  “Key opportunities” are outlined in bullets in the documents. While acknowledging some areas have “very long waitlists” for the therapy, the company said it aims to “prevent new providers from joining the network” and “terminate” existing ones, including “cost outliers.” If an insurer drops a provider from its network, patients may have to find a new clinician that accepts their insurance or pay up to tens of thousands of dollars a year out of pocket for the therapy. The company has calculated that, in some states, this reduction could impact more than two-fifths of its ABA therapy provider groups in network and up to 19% of its patients in therapy.  Internal company documents reveal the strategy by Optum, a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary, to prevent ABA providers from participating in its network. Obtained by ProPublica  The strategy targets kids covered through the company’s state-contracted Medicaid plans, funded by the government for the nation’s poorest and most vulnerable patients. To manage Medicaid benefits, states often pay private insurers a fixed amount of funds per patient, regardless of the frequency or intensity of services used. When companies spend less than the allotted payment, they are typically allowed to keep some or all of what remains, which federal investigators and experts acknowledge may be incentivizing insurers to limit care.  United administers Medicaid plans or benefits in about two dozen states and for more than 6 million people, including nearly 10,000 children with autism spectrum disorder. Optum expects to spend about $290 million for ABA therapy within its Medicaid plans this year, and it anticipates the need increasing, documents show. The number of its Medicaid patients accessing the specialized therapy has increased by about 20% over the past year, with expenses rising about $75 million year-on-year.  So Optum — whose parent company, UnitedHealth Group, earned $22 billion in net profits last year — is “heavily investing” in its plan to save millions by limiting access to such care.  In addition to culling providers from its network, the company is scrutinizing the medical necessity of the therapy for individual patients with “rigorous” clinical reviews, which can lead to denials of covered treatment. Optum has developed an “approach to authorizing less units than requested,” the records state.  Internal company documents reveal Optum is deploying “rigorous utilization management” in response to an increased need for ABA therapy. Obtained by ProPublica  Mental health and autism experts and advocates reviewed ProPublica’s findings and expressed outrage over the company’s strategy. Karen Fessel, whose Mental Health and Autism Insurance Project helps families access care, called the tactics “unconscionable and immoral.”  “They’re denying access to treatment and shrinking a network at a time when they clearly know that there is an urgent need,” she said.  United and Optum declined a request ProPublica made more than a month ago for an on-the-record interview about their coverage of behavioral health care. They have not answered questions emailed 11 days ago, citing the Dec. 4 killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO as the reason. In an email, a spokesperson said “we are in mourning” and could not engage with a “non-urgent story during this incredibly difficult moment in time.” Offered an additional day or two, the company would not agree to a deadline for comment.  Benji, who is now 10, requires 33 hours of weekly therapy to be able to progress, his therapists have concluded. They have documented the consequences of having even a few hours less: toppled furniture, scratched-up classroom aides, a kid in unremitting tears, unable to learn. But in a letter to Menard, Optum said it was refusing to pay for the full hours, stating that her son had been in therapy for too long and was not showing enough progress to ultimately graduate from it.  “Your child still has a lot of difficulty with all autism-related needs,” Optum wrote. “Your child still needs help, but it does not appear that your child will improve enough to end ABA.”  The response confounded experts who spoke with ProPublica, who said such an approach misunderstands the long-term nature of his condition. “Challenges that often come with autism shouldn’t be looked at like an injury that you’re going to get better from quickly and then the treatment can stop,” said Christa Stevens, who directs state government affairs for the advocacy group Autism Speaks. “Treatment may still be medically necessary even if it’s for skill maintenance or the prevention of regression.”  The company’s denial also appears to contrast with recent professional guidelines for the therapy — which are cited as a reference in Optum’s own clinical criteria — that state “there is no specific limit on the duration of a course of treatment.”  The appropriate duration of treatment, according to those standards and experts interviewed by ProPublica, should be based on the patients’ needs, as evaluated by the clinicians working directly with the patients.  “This is a very blunt instrument to chase after excessive costs,” said Tim Clement, the vice president of federal government affairs at the nonprofit group Mental Health America.  Several advocates told ProPublica the company’s strategy is legally questionable.  The federal mental health parity law requires insurers to provide the same access to mental health and physical care. As ProPublica recently reported, United has gotten in trouble in the past for targeting therapy coverage in a way that violates the law; while denying the allegations, it agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement. It continues to use arbitrary and one-size-fits-all thresholds to scrutinize its therapy claims, ProPublica previously found.  It would raise legal questions if the company restricted ABA more stringently than comparable physical care, the advocates said.  “Medicaid managed care organizations are subject to the parity act,” said Deborah Steinberg, a senior health policy attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Legal Action Center. The company may be violating Medicaid regulations, she said, which require managed care organizations to maintain networks sufficient to provide covered services to all enrollees.  Last year, the federal government formally affirmed that ABA therapy is a protected benefit, and it recently investigated health plans for entirely excluding its coverage; legislators have passed laws in every state requiring insurance companies to pay for it.  “Yes, this therapy can be expensive,” said Dan Unumb, an attorney and president of the Autism Legal Resource Center. “But solving the problem by denying kids access to medically necessary care is a terrible solution.”  ‘What happens if we withdraw the care?’  Benji dances with his behavior analyst, Whitney Newton, at Aspire Behavioral Health Center in Lafayette. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  Benji was making progress about three years ago.  For more than 33 hours a week in the specialized therapy, his clinicians broke down the learning process into basic steps, using repetition and positive reinforcement to affirm behaviors. The state’s Medicaid contractor, UnitedHealthcare, covered the bill.  Researchers have found that about a quarter of kids diagnosed with autism are severely affected; these children are often minimally or non-speaking or require extensive assistance for basic daily needs. “Things a lot of people take for granted,” said Menard. While experts continue to debate which therapies are most effective and appropriate for these kids, ABA is one of the most widely recommended.  By 7, Benji had accumulated a few dozen words, and his aggressive, prolonged tantrums had grown less frequent, allowing his mother to take him grocery shopping and to mass on Sundays. It was time for him to go to school, she thought.  Menard enrolled him in their public school district, St. Martin Parish. He attended Breaux Bridge Primary twice a week in a special education classroom and continued therapy the other days. Menard urged the district to allow a therapeutic technician to shadow him in school, but it refused. (The district declined to respond to ProPublica’s questions, citing privacy restrictions.)  With the diminished hours of treatment, Benji grew increasingly disruptive. “It was a disaster,” said Menard. He snapped a swing in gym class and struggled to sit still during lessons. When teachers tried to give him instructions, he hit them. His speech plateaued and eventually regressed.  Menard, who cleans pools for a living, grew to fear the moment her phone rang. School employees, unable to soothe Benji’s tantrums, frequently called her to take him home. One morning last spring, they told her Benji had lashed out when an aide tried to persuade him to work, aggressively poking their hand with a pencil. He hadn’t broken the skin, but after a dozen incidents, the situation was becoming unsalvageable. The district made her sign a behavioral contract, his second in two years: If Benji didn’t behave, he could be suspended or expelled.  Menard felt she had no choice but to withdraw Benji. She enrolled him full time in a home-study program run by his therapy group, Aspire Behavioral Health Center in Lafayette, which costs about $10,000 a year in tuition, a substantial portion of her paycheck. That was in addition to the therapy cost, which his insurance still covered.  Benji’s clinicians determined he needed direct support for most of the day and told Optum they wanted him to scale up his therapy from 24 hours a week to 33. They expected the insurer would approve the request; after all, it was less than what was previously covered and only nine hours more than it was currently paying for.  But Optum denied the increase in a letter to Menard this past May. “Your child has been in ABA for six years,” the insurer wrote. “After six years, more progress would be expected.”  The response disturbed Whitney Newton, Benji’s behavior analyst and a clinical director at Aspire; it didn’t seem rooted in the established medical standards for the treatment. She’d seen firsthand how critical the therapy had been to his growth. “We know what he needs. It’s in our scope of practice and it’s our right as the provider to determine that,” she said. “They’re cutting and denying an unethical amount.”  The center’s founder, psychologist Joslyn McCoy, has grown accustomed to battling insurers. Her practice serves about 160 patients between the ages of 2 and 19 across five centers, and many have Medicaid coverage. In 2022, Louisiana expanded its Medicaid parameters, allowing parents with higher incomes to access coverage for children with complex medical needs.  “What I’m seeing is that children now have this ticket to access this care, but then once they go to try to access it, it’s being denied,” she said.  Nearly two years ago, Optum selected her center for a payment integrity audit, demanding to inspect its clinical and billing records. After her team turned over thousands of pages of documentation, Optum conducted a separate in-person quality review.  Internal company records show Optum is targeting ABA providers for scrutiny based on how much they invoice and how many services they provide. Groups like McCoy’s can be flagged for patterns that providers told ProPublica are typical in the delivery of ABA therapy: billing on weekends or holidays, serving multiple family members in one practice, having long clinician or patient days, providing an “above average delivery” of services, or abruptly increasing or decreasing the number of patients or claims.  Internal company documents reveal Optum’s strategy for identifying ABA providers for scrutiny based on “outlier patterns.” Obtained by ProPublica  McCoy said that a company executive who visited her office for the quality review told her that she approved of the center’s work and thought Aspire should expand across the state.  But Optum has continued to challenge her patients’ individual therapy claims.  When her team received the denial for Benji’s care, McCoy set out to gather hard evidence to demonstrate the necessity of his treatment. “It’s what we call a reversal to baseline, where we will withdraw the treatment for a short period of time,” McCoy said. “The reason is to demonstrate what happens because we’re curious, too: What happens if we withdraw the care?”  Much of the therapy is driven by positive reinforcement; for example, if Benji pays attention and engages in his academic exercises, he can take a break to play on his iPad. But the reward is contingent on him not hitting anyone for at least 10 minutes at a time. During the experiment, the clinicians took away the possibility of his reward, and without an incentive, they had limited leverage to manage his behavior.  Joslyn McCoy, founder and director of Aspire Behavioral Health Center. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  At first, Benji lightly hit the staff, they said, as though testing the limits. But when there was no response to his behavior, it began to escalate. He tossed chairs and flipped tables. He pushed Newton into a bookshelf, which collapsed to the ground. He hit walls and windows, eventually turning his fists on his aide. They stopped the experiment early, both for his safety and theirs.  Once they resumed the interventions, Benji was able to calm down.  Newton drafted a report, including line charts that quantified his behavior with and without the interventions and photographs of her team’s injuries. She faxed it to Optum, asking the company to reconsider the denial.  The insurer did not change its decision.  ‘The need is not going away’  Last month, inside a cubicle decorated with posters of Minions and Mario Brothers, a behavior technician placed a laminated card with an image of a sneaker in front of Benji.  “What is this?” she asked him.  Benji paused, rubbing the edge of his baseball cap and pursing his lips. “Sh,” he said, stuck on the consonant.  “Shoes, that’s right,” the technician responded. She pulled out another card, showing a slice topped with white frosting. “Is this cake?”  “No,” Benji said.  “Is this cake?” she repeated, before adding, “yes.”  “Yes,” echoed Benji, but her correction appeared to frustrate him. He hit the technician on the leg, softly but with determination.  “We’ll let it go,” she warned with a sugared voice, “but hands to self, OK?”  Benji works with registered behavioral technician Hortencia Cervantez during ABA treatment. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  After 10 minutes, a timer beeped. It was time for Benji’s reward, getting to hear a reggaeton hit by Daddy Yankee. “It’s a big reinforcer here,” Newton said.  Even though Optum denied the additional hours of treatment, Benji has continued to receive them. “We’re giving the hours even if they were not approved,” McCoy said. “We don’t think it would be safe for him to do what the insurance is saying.”  Next month, a state administrative law judge will hear an appeal for the additional hours. If the request is approved, Benji’s clinicians will be paid for the six months of services that they’ve provided without reimbursement.  Even if that happens, their battle with the insurer will go back to square one. Each insurance authorization typically lasts for only six months, and soon after the hearing date, the clinicians will have to request coverage for his treatment again.  They will be doing so at a time when internal records show Optum has deployed more than 90 “care advocates” to question clinicians about the medical necessity of their patients’ ABA treatment, using “quality initiatives to decrease overutilization and cost.”  Optum is focusing on states whose Medicaid plans yield the highest costs for ABA therapy, including Arizona, Nebraska, Tennessee, Virginia, New Jersey, Indiana and Louisiana, where Menard and her son live. ProPublica reached out to the state Medicaid programs with questions about their oversight of United’s practices. Arizona’s Medicaid agency told ProPublica that all managed care organizations, including United, are required to provide timely services within their networks, and that the agency has been closely monitoring ABA networks. (Read its full response.) No other state Medicaid agencies responded to ProPublica’s questions.  Internal company documents reveal Optum’s strategy for managing its ABA coverage. Obtained by ProPublica  Autism experts said such a strategy may not only be harmful to children, it could also ultimately be more expensive for states, as children age and require more intensive services, like residential or nursing care.  “If these kids get the intervention they need as children, then there will be tremendous cost savings over the course of their lives,” said Lorri Unumb, an attorney and CEO of the Council of Autism Service Providers.  Menard worries about what will happen to her son’s hard-fought gains if he can’t get the level of therapy he needs. And even if the additional nine hours are approved, she fears that with the next authorization, they could face a more drastic denial that could be challenging to overturn.

She just hopes the therapy helps him to be better able to advocate for himself and, ultimately, be safe. “There’s nothing else that I’ve known to work,” she said.  McCoy resents being put in the position of scaling back care that her patient needs because an insurer is refusing to pay. “It puts us in a tough place, because we don’t want to discontinue therapy of our client who’s not ready,” she said.  When such denials become common, it disincentivizes clinicians from working with insurance companies, she said, and can ultimately drive clinics into the ground. “The patients can’t afford it,” she said, “so eventually the private provider goes out of business.”  But even if children like Benji get pushed out of treatment, there is no shortage of children seeking care. McCoy’s center currently has a waitlist of about 260 children.  That list may likely expand. Internal documents show Optum is aiming to exclude from its network about 40% of Louisiana groups that offer ABA therapy. About 1 in 5 children whose treatment is covered by the company’s Medicaid plan in the state could lose access to care.  “If the insurance company wants to deny all of our clients, we’re going to replace them,” she said. “The need is not going away.”"
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/science/jupiter-moon-io-lava-chambers/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,NASA mission solves volcanic mystery of Jupiter’s ‘tortured moon’ Io,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  Flybys of Jupiter’s fiery moon Io, carried out by NASA’s Juno spacecraft, are helping to solve the enduring mystery of why the small moon is the most volcanically active body in our solar system.  Similar in size to Earth’s moon, Io has an estimated 400 volcanoes that continuously release plumes and lava that coat that moon’s surface.  The Juno mission, which has been orbiting and observing Jupiter and its moons since July 2016, made incredibly close flybys of Io in December 2023 and February. The spacecraft zipped within 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) of the moon’s surface, capturing images and data. Together, Juno’s flybys have enabled an unprecedented look at the smoldering moon, including taking observations of its poles for the first time.  Researchers presented some of the results from an analysis of the flyby data Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in Washington, DC. A paper detailing some of the findings was also published Thursday in the journal Nature.  “Io is one of the most intriguing objects in the whole solar system,” said study coauthor Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator and an associate vice president at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “We can see that this body is completely covered with volcanoes over both poles and all across its middle, (which are) constantly going off.”  Volcanoes on the surface of Io erupt continuously, as depicted in this animation. NASA  The new data suggests that Io’s numerous volcanoes are each likely powered by their own chamber of hot magma, rather than being fed by a global ocean of magma beneath the surface. The latter had long been a prevailing hypothesis by astronomers.  The finding could change the way astronomers understand moons dominated by subsurface global oceans in our solar system, such as Jupiter’s moon Europa and planets beyond our solar system.  Spotting a cosmic pizza  Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, known as the father of modern astronomy, discovered Io on January 8, 1610.  But the moon’s wild volcanic activity wasn’t detected until Voyager 1 flew by Jupiter and its moons in 1979, revealing Io’s dynamic surface that resembled a pepperoni pizza, Bolton said.  NASA's Juno spacecraft captures the north polar region of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io on December 30, 2023. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS  That year, Linda Morabito, an imaging scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, became the first person to identify a volcanic plume as she studied an image of Io captured by Voyager 1.  The revelation sparked a decades-long mystery as astronomers wondered about the origins of Io’s constant volcanic activity.  “Since Morabito’s discovery, planetary scientists have wondered how the volcanoes were fed from the lava underneath the surface,” Bolton said. “Was there a shallow ocean of white-hot magma fueling the volcanoes, or was their source more localized? We knew data from Juno’s two very close flybys could give us some insights on how this tortured moon actually worked.”  This sequence of images taken by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2007 shows a giant plume from Io's Tvashtar volcano. NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute  Flyby revelations  Io orbits around Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, which Bolton calls a “monster.” The moon’s orbit is imperfect, meaning that sometimes it comes closer to Jupiter during its orbit, and other times it is farther away. Io completes one orbit around the planet every 42.5 hours.  Jupiter’s massive gravitational influence squeezes Io as it orbits the planet, like a hand squeezing a rubber ball, which warms up the moon. This phenomenon is called tidal flexing, or friction from tidal forces that generate internal heat.  “That’s what’s happening inside Io,” Bolton said. “That squeezing is generating heat, and it’s getting so hot that (Io’s) insides are literally melting and popping out. The eruptions are constant. It’s like a nonstop rainstorm. It’s just always erupting all over the place.”  Io is tiny in comparison with Jupiter, as seen in this animation, and the giant planet's gravitational forces cause the inhospitable conditions on the fiery moon. CNN/NASA  The constant flexing of Jupiter’s tug on Io generates immense energy, which would melt part of the moon’s interior, Bolton said. And if the melting was substantial enough, it would create a global magma ocean that Juno could use its instruments to detect.  During its close flybys, Juno captured high-precision Doppler data, which measured Io’s gravity by tracking how zipping closely to the moon affected the spacecraft’s acceleration. The data was compared with observations from previous missions that have flown by Jupiter and its moons, such as NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, as well as ground-based telescopes.  Together, the observations point to a rigid, mostly solid interior beneath Io’s surface, rather than a global magma ocean — solving a 45-year mystery started by Voyager 1’s observations. Instead, the volcanoes are powered by more local sources, and each one has its own pocket of magma beneath it.  “Juno’s discovery that tidal forces do not always create global magma oceans does more than prompt us to rethink what we know about Io’s interior,” said lead study author Ryan Park, a Juno co-investigator and supervisor of the Solar System Dynamics Group at JPL, in a statement. “It has implications for our understanding of other moons, such as (Saturn’s) Enceladus and Europa, and even exoplanets and super-Earths. Our new findings provide an opportunity to rethink what we know about planetary formation and evolution.”  The mission has also helped to capture an array of imagery that showcases Io’s “primordial fantasy land surface,” said Heidi Becker, a planetary scientist at JPL who was not involved in the study. The images are bringing different features on Io into focus like never before, including islands spotted on massive lava lakes, such as one called Loki Patera, which is so large that astronomers compare it more to a lava sea sitting on Io’s surface.  This animation shows the harsh features created by lava on the surface of Io. CNN/JPL  The Juno spacecraft continues to contribute new insights about Jupiter and its moons, having recently completed a flyby over Jupiter’s swirling cloud tops on November 24. Next, Juno will swing by 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers) above Jupiter’s center on December 27, logging 645.7 million miles (1.04 billion kilometers) since beginning its investigation of Jupiter eight years ago."
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/from-true-crimes-to-terror-when-is-dark-tourism-too-dark/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,From true crimes to terror: When is ‘dark tourism’ too dark?,"CNN —  Fifty years ago, parishioners from Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple in San Francisco began to settle a rural commune in the South American country of Guyana. The Jonestown experiment ended four years later in one of the most tragic and bizarre murder-suicide incidents in American history. More than 900 people died on November 18, 1978, including a US congressman named Leo Ryan.  Now that Guyana is considering a proposal by a government-backed tour operator to open the now-overgrown compound to visitors, it raises a fascinating debate about the appeal, ethics and sensitivities of so-called “dark tourism” — the visiting of sites associated with tragedy.  Why are the locations of past atrocities, natural disasters, infamous deaths and incarcerations so popular with visitors? What does it say about us that we want to get close to these vortexes of disaster and evil? What obligations do governments have to give or deny access? Who gets to decide how history is presented to visitors? And what impact do such events and the subsequent visitors have on those who live near these spots?  There are no simple answers, but it’s important to explore the questions anyway.  Is it not simply history?  The welcome sign at the entrance of Jonestown, Guyana in 2022.

Design Pics Inc/Shutterstock dark tourism Prev Next  On my first cross-country trip, in college, my girlfriend and I stopped at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, the site of a battle in which nearly 200 died, including a former US congressman named Davy Crockett. Then a week later in Los Angeles, local relatives of mine took us on a driving tour that included the crime scene address of then-recently murdered Nicole Brown Simpson. The former visit felt like a US history lesson, the latter like morbid gawking. And somewhere in between is the subjective line that dark tourism dances around.  Dark tourism (also known as memorial tourism, or thanatourism, from the Greek “Thanatos” meaning death, or more derogatorily as morbid tourism, or grief tourism) comes in various shades.  Gettysburg was the single deadliest battle in the US Civil War, where 51,000 souls took their last breath, and yet where countless school field trips and, according to the National Park Service, 1.5 million visitors flock every year. Is that dark tourism? How about visiting the beaches in France where between 8,000 and 14,000 soldiers died in the D-Day invasions that turned the tide for Allies winning World War II? And what of Ground Zero and Flight 93 memorials for more than 3,000 who died on September 11, 2001?  I have toured Cambodia’s Killing Fields, with a survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide that left between 1.5 and 3 million murdered (in the four years following the Jonestown tragedy). Isn’t it important to visit atrocities such as that one, and former Nazi concentration camps?  The point of visiting these places is to feel uncomfortable, to bear witness, to share what you’ve seen and how it made you feel. Travel changes us, and sometimes because of exposure to the worst of human nature.  You’ve heard of the Disneyfication of places. Dark tourism is the opposite of that. These are the unhappiest places on earth. Yet they are places you should never forget. To go there honors the dead, their memory, their pain.  How far is too far?  There are examples when the line seems less clear, where bearing witness to past events feels more like slowing down to see the aftermath of a fatal car accident.  The first time I visited Savannah, Georgia I took a “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” tour. This was not long after the best-selling book of that name became a Hollywood film chronicling a real double murder that took place less than 10 years earlier. On the tour I kept thinking, “The people who live next door to these places may actually remember the victims, may have even been friends with them.”  People outside the Beverly Hills, California mansion where brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents in 1989 David Swanson/AFP/Getty Images  Just last month we reported on how the Los Angeles mansion where Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents has become the latest “dark tourism” hot spot. The brothers are back in the news and the subject of a recent documentary, but it’s hard to imagine what visitors are learning by simply staring at a crime scene. It reminded me of my Simpson murder scene visit, or the time I tried to find LA’s Cielo Drive, the site of the 1969 murders by the Manson “family.”  But how many degrees are those stops from touring Ford’s Theatre in Washington DC where a president was shot, or the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas from which another was? Is it ok to see thousands of Mount Vesuvius’ victims in Pompei, Italy because they were killed 2,000 years ago? How about going on an entertaining tour of Jack the Ripper’s victims in London from the late 1800s? Or paying a lot of money to go deep underwater for a view of the Titanic – where visitors themselves died last year while exploring a shipwreck where about 1,500 died just over 100 years ago? Does time desensitize us to these crimes and tragedies?  What is your intention?  In the early 2000s, while visiting friends living in Gloucester, Massachusetts, I felt an undertow pulling me toward the Crow’s Nest, the local bar made famous in a book by Sebastian Junger and the subsequent film of the same name, “The Perfect Storm.” They document the 1991 storm and final days of six fishermen from the small, tight knit community who frequented the Crow’s Nest.  On one visit I was walking along Gloucester’s small harbor when I saw a new ice cream shop had opened called The Perfect Scoop. I thought it rather distasteful, a description I’ve never before nor since used to describe ice cream, and it left me feeling embarrassed for having wanted to visit the Crow’s Nest. I decided to leave the salty bar to the locals.  The bookcase to the secret annex in the renovated Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Frank died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945 at the age of 15. Koen Van Weel/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock  But I’ve enjoyed the murder-heavy night tour of San Francisco’s Alcatraz prison island; walked through the “Bloody Sunday” neighborhood of Derry, Northern Ireland; visited Anne Frank’s home in Amsterdam and was equally moved by The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, inside the old Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. This summer I’m planning a family trip to Japan and added Hiroshima to the itinerary because I feel it’s important for my daughters to make a connection to the violence our country unleashed on another country, killing at least 66,000 in that city alone.  And I’ve long wanted to visit Jonestown. When I lived in San Francisco, just before seeing a show at the famous Fillmore auditorium, I popped around the corner to see the location of Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple, the last stop before Guyana. I feel drawn to follow that nightmare of a story into the real world, where it has been sitting in situ since the mass deaths. I want to talk to those who live nearby, understand the events more clearly, bear witness, go into the heart of darkness.  Perhaps the salient question to ask oneself before planning such a trip is: What is the intention? Is it to learn and understand? Or is it merely to scratch the itch of a morbid curiosity? Think about the locals, of the friends and family who are connected to the tragedy and ask whether visiting honors a legacy or exploits a tragedy. In the end, you may be the only one who can judge the ethics of visiting these places."

Nancy Pelosi underwent a “successful” hip replacement surgery Saturday and is “well on the mend,” according to a spokesperson, one day after being hospitalized from an injury sustained during an official engagement in Luxembourg.  Pelosi was admitted to a hospital in Luxembourg as the result of a fall on the stairs, three sources told CNN. Pelosi’s office declined to comm﻿ent on how the California congresswoman was injured.  Pelosi, 84, is receiving “excellent care” from doctors and medical professionals, Ian Krager, the spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday.  The US military had medevaced the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. The medical center is a major military hospital that for years has treated US troops injured in combat.  “While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,” Krager said Friday.  Pelosi is “currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals. She continues to work and regrets that she is unable to attend the remainder of the CODEL engagements to honor the courage of our servicemembers during one of the greatest acts of American heroism in our nation’s history,” Krager said, adding that Pelosi “looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.”  The injury sustained by Pelosi came just days after longtime Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell tripped and fell at the US Capitol, spraining his wrist and cutting his face.  McConnell sustained a “minor cut to the face” and was “cleared to resume his schedule,” a spokesperson for the 82-year-old Kentucky Republican said in a statement Tuesday.

Earlier this week, an anonymous Jane Doe filed an amended complaint against Combs and Jay-Z, whose given name is Shawn Carter, which revealed that a previously unnamed celebrity in her original complaint against Combs, initially filed in October, was Carter. In the amended complaint, Carter is accused of raping the then-13-year-old Jane Doe at an afterparty for the MTV Video Music Awards in the year 2000.  The amended complaint made Carter the first celebrity to be accused of sexual assault in connection to Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to three federal charges and is awaiting a criminal trial.  In a new interview on Friday, the Jane Doe said she is standing by her rape accusation against Carter, but admits to inconsistencies in her original story, including key corroborating witnesses.  “I have made some mistakes,” the Jane Doe told NBC News. “You should always advocate for yourself and be a voice for yourself. You should never let what somebody else did ruin or run your life. I just hope I can give others the strength to come forward like I came forward.”  In her initial complaint, Jane Doe said that she asked her father to pick her up in 2000 after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Carter and Combs. But her father now said that he does not recall picking her up, according to NBC News, which also reported that Jane Doe said that she spoke to a celebrity the night she alleged she was raped, but that celebrity said they were not in New York at the time her allegations took place.  Jane Doe’s attorney, Tony Buzbee, said that he is still vetting his client’s claims, but is standing by her accusations.  “Our client remains fiercely adamant that what she has stated is true, to the best of her memory. We will continue to vet her claims and collect corroborating data to the extent it exists. Because we have interrogated her intensely, she has even agreed to submit to a polygraph. I’ve never had a client suggest that before,” Buzbee told CNN via email on Friday evening. “In any event, we always do our best to vet each claim made, just as we did in this case. This has been extremely distressing for her, to the point she has experienced seizures and had to seek medical treatment due to the stress.”  In a statement issued to CNN, Carter said that the woman’s inconsistencies “proves” that Buzbee “filed a false complaint against me in the pursuit of money and fame.”  “This incident didn’t happen and yet he filed it in court and doubled down in the press,” Carter’s statement continued. “True Justice is coming. We fight FROM victory, not FOR victory. This was over before it began. This 1-800 lawyer doesn’t realize it yet, but, soon.”  Carter’s attorney, Alex Spiro, told CNN: “It is stunning that a lawyer would not only file such a serious complaint without proper vetting, but would make things worse by further peddling this false story in the press. We are asking the Court to dismiss this frivolous case today, and will take up the matter of additional discipline for Mr. Buzbee and all the lawyers that filed the complaint.”  Spiro also filed a letter to the judge on Friday night, regarding the inconsistencies in Jane Doe’s account, calling her allegations a “sham.”  “Basic facts in her narrative – the who, what, when, and where – are wrong,” Spiro wrote to the judge. “When pressed, the Plaintiff admitted she was ‘guessing’ about key details… She admits she has no single corroborating witness over the last 24 years.”  Prior to Buzbee filing Jane Doe’s amended complaint in which Carter was named, Carter’s lawyers had filed an extortion suit against Buzbee, claiming that the Houston-based attorney was trying to “shakedown innocent celebrities, politicians, and businesspeople with an army of masked accusers.”  Lawyers for Combs, who has previously denied all civil allegations against him, criticized Buzbee in a statement to CNN.  “This is the beginning of the end of this shameful money grab.”"

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Downtown San Francisco experiences first tornado warning in recorded history,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said. Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and about 300 miles northwest of Sacramento."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/india/india-pollution-kids-health-hnk-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Delhi smog: Meet the kids struggling to breathe in India’s choked capital,"New Delhi CNN —  As pollution worsens in the Indian capital, parents are facing an impossible choice: stay or go.  Amrita Rosha, 45, is among those choosing to flee with her children. Both of them — Vanaaya, 4, and Abhiraj, 9 — suffer from respiratory problems due to rising pollution and need medication.  “We have no other option but to leave Delhi,” Rosha, a housewife who is married to a businessman, told CNN last month from her home in an affluent South Delhi neighborhood as she completed last-minute packing before leaving for the Gulf state of Oman.  Every year for the past decade, a blanket of smog has enveloped Delhi when winter approaches, turning day into night and disrupting the lives of millions of people. Some of them, particularly young children with less developed immune systems, are forced to seek medical care for breathing issues.  Rosha ensures her children get top health care — including doctors’ visits, steamers, inhalers and steroids — and trips outside Delhi to escape the choking air.  Amrita Rosha with her children Vanaaya, 4, and Abhiraj, 9, in her bungalow in South Delhi. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  While wealthy families like the Roshas can escape, it’s a different story for those without the means to leave.  About 15 miles away in a Delhi slum, Muskan, who goes by her first name, looks on with worry at the remaining medicine drops for her children’s nebulizer, a machine which turns liquid medication into fine mist to be inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece.  The mother rations its use because she struggles to afford more.  “We give half-half (of the dosage) of the medicines to our children,” she said, referring to Chahat, 3, and Diya, 1. They’ve been on nebulizers since each of their first winters, as early as they were born.  Muskan bought the $9 nebulizer after weeks of hard work on the streets. She makes a living picking up rags and other pieces of refuse, and her husband is a day laborer.  “When they cough, I feel scared that my children may die. I’m filled with regret, as I keep worrying about something awful happening to them,” she said.  Muskan holds her daughter Diya while while her 3-year-old son Chahat uses the nebulizer. “He thinks it is a toy,” she said as he puts it on himself with ease. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  Leaving Delhi  The suffering of Delhi’s children, year after year, has become impossible to ignore.  “Children are having to rely on steroids and inhalers to breathe … all of north India has been pushed into a medical emergency,” Delhi’s Chief Minister Atishi, who goes by her first name, said last month.  The Supreme Court has stepped in to monitor the measures introduced to curb pollution, which is generally caused by a combination of factors including vehicular emissions, crop burning and construction work, along with unfavorable meteorological and climatic conditions.  This has included banning cars, demolition and construction work, and spraying roads with water. Authorities have also increased public transport and cracked down on crop burning.  Despite these measures, Delhi has remained the most polluted city across India in November for eight years, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.  Manjinder Singh Randhawa, a doctor in the pediatric intensive care unit at the Rainbow Children’s Hospital, said this year he has been diagnosing younger children with asthma in “a very critical state” for the first time.  Video Ad Feedback India's toxic smog puts children at risk 02:54 - Source: CNN  In the long-term, pollution can have a serious impact on the respiratory, immune and cardiovascular systems, he added.  CNN has reached out for comment to the central and state government, and the Commission for Air Quality Management responsible for maintaining air quality in the region.  In some parts of Delhi last month, pollution levels exceeded 1,750 on the Air Quality Index, according to IQAir, which monitors global air pollution. Any reading above 300 is considered a health hazard.  During these weeks the pollution levels for PM 2.5, smaller particles which can penetrate deep into the lungs, spiked to more than 70 times the health limits set by the World Health Organization. It was over 20 times that level this week. Studies indicate that inhaling PM 2.5 can lead to cognitive impairment in children.  A costly escape  Some parents, like Deepthi Ramdas, prioritized their children’s health and relocated years ago. When her son Rudra was born three years ago, she did not think leaving Delhi would ever be on the cards. But that changed when she saw him admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in January 2022.  The doctors told her she should leave Delhi if she wanted her son’s lungs to develop, Deepthi recalled. Since she had family in the southern state of Kerala, she decided to go.  “It was not an easy decision. I had to quit my job which I loved… and because my husband had to continue to be in Delhi for work… we got into a long-distance marriage,” she said.  Deepthi Ramdas' son was hospitalized when he was less than a year old in 2022. “We keep this as a keepsake to remember one of his worst times yet,” she said. Deepthi Ramdas  But Deepthi finds relief in knowing Rudra has had no breathing issues in Kerala. They visited Delhi in the first week of December to meet their father. “We hoped since he is 3 now (that) his lungs would be stronger, but within a few days Rudra had an attack and was on nebulizers again,” Deepthi said.  “Looking at him like that was heartbreaking. There is no way I am moving back to Delhi,” she said, sharing pictures of Rudra from when he was in hospital in 2022 to him playing outdoors in Kerala in October.  Anxiety in the air  Many parents in Delhi are living under anxiety fueled by their inability to escape the city due to work and other commitments.  “This is not something you just do, you have to plan it, and be fortunate enough,” 29-year-old mother Urvee Parasramka told CNN. Her daughter Reva, 2, has been on nebulizers since her first winter, she said.  When Urvee was expecting, she recalls her husband, Prateek Tulsyan, responding to news of pollution by saying he’d ensure there were enough air purifiers at home to protect his child. However, nine months after delivery, Reva had her first attack.  “There was a lot of panic then. It was hard to understand why she even needed such heavy medication. I was very scared. It took me a while to come around,” Prateek told CNN.  Urvee added: “I am constantly checking her temperature, do not allow her to go out or eat anything that may exacerbate her condition. I am now an over-protective parent.”  If she hears Reva sneeze, she knows a cough is coming, followed by congestion and then the need for the nebulizer.  Urvee said they’ve decided to move to Guwahati, northeast India, where the air quality is better, during the high pollution months next year.  “I am born and brought up here, comfortable here, so to create another home there won’t be easy but we have no choice,” she said.  No way out  Muskan and her neighbors in the Delhi slum are not as fortunate.  She runs to the shared nebulizer when her children show symptoms like chest pain, coughing or vomiting. She says the children ask for it themselves and use it with practiced precision. But not everyone is able to afford to have the machine at home.  Some of her neighbors rush to the nearest private clinic and pay about 80 rupees or $1 for each treatment.  One of them is Deepak Kumar, a daily wage worker with four children. His youngest and only daughter, Kripa, 1, is using a nebulizer for the second consecutive winter season since her birth.  Deepak Kumar holds his daughter Kripa, 1, for whom he has had to take on debt to pay for urgent medical expenses. “If I put her down she starts crying,” he said. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  “The doctor asked us to buy it, but we do not have that kind of money,” he said.  One visit to the doctor costs more than his daily wage.  Nights are the worst. When there are no doctors available, he relies on balms and steam to help his daughter get through the night. Even when she is sleeping well, the mounting debt due to medical expenses keeps him awake.  “Yes, I am in debt of 20,000 rupees ($235) and to pay that off I am trying to work even harder,” he said.  Many like Kumar have come to Delhi from different parts of India to seek a better life, but they’re stuck.  “It should not be so hard to live in the capital,” he said."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/science/oldest-human-dna-neanderthal-ancestry/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Oldest human DNA helps pinpoint when early humans interbred with Neanderthals,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  Scientists say they have recovered the oldest known Homo sapiens DNA from human remains found in Europe, and the information is helping to reveal our species’ shared history with Neanderthals.  The ancient genomes sequenced from 13 bone fragments unearthed in a cave beneath a medieval castle in Ranis, Germany, belonged to six individuals, including a mother, daughter and distant cousins who lived in the region around 45,000 years ago, according to the study that published Thursday in the journal Nature.  The genomes carried evidence of Neanderthal ancestry. Researchers determined that the ancestors of those early humans who lived in Ranis and the surrounding area likely encountered and made babies with Neanderthals about 80 generations earlier, or 1,500 years earlier, although that interaction did not necessarily happen in the same place.  Scientists have known since the first Neanderthal genome was sequenced in 2010 that early humans interbred with Neanderthals, a bombshell revelation that bequeathed a genetic legacy still traceable in humans today.  However, exactly when, how often and where this critical and mysterious juncture in human history took place has been hard to pin down. Scientists have believed interspecies relations would have occurred somewhere in the Middle East as a wave of Homo sapiens left Africa and bumped into Neanderthals, who had lived across Eurasia for 250,000 years.  The cave where the ancient human remains were found is located beneath a castle in Ranis, Germany. Martin Schutt/picture alliance/Getty Images  A broader study on Neanderthal ancestry, published Thursday in the journal Science, that analyzed information from the genomes of 59 ancient humans and those of 275 living humans corroborated the more precise timeline, finding that the majority of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans can be attributed to a “single, shared extended period of gene flow.”  “We were far more similar than we were different,” Priya Moorjani, a senior author of the Science study and an assistant professor in the department of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, said at a news briefing.  “The differences that we imagined between these groups to be very big, actually, were very small, genetically speaking. They seem to have mixed with each other for a long period of time and were living side by side for a long period of time.”  The research pinpointed a pivotal period that began about 50,500 years ago and ended around 43,500 years ago — not long before the now extinct Neanderthals began to disappear from the archaeological record. Over this 7,000-year time frame, early humans encountered Neanderthals, had sex and gave birth to children on a fairly regular basis. The height of the activity was 47,000 years ago, the study suggested.  The research also showed how certain genetic variants inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors, which make up between 1% and 3% of our genomes today, varied over time. Some, such as those related to the immune system, were beneficial to humans as they lived through the last ice age, when temperatures were much cooler, and they continue to confer benefits today.  The two studies lend “substantial confidence” to the timing of when humans and Neanderthals exchanged genes, something geneticists describe as introgression, said evolutionary geneticist Tony Capra, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics in the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute at the University of California, San Francisco.  “Genetic data from this crucial period in our evolution are very rare,” said Capra, who wasn’t involved in the research, via email. “These studies underscore how having even a few ancient genomes provides powerful perspective that enabled the authors to refine our understanding of human migration and Neanderthal introgression.”  A skull found in Zlatý kůň in the Czech Republic contains DNA that linked the woman to the Ranis individuals. Marek Jantač  The scientists working on the two research projects decided to publish their work at the same time when they realized they had separately reached a similar conclusion.  How Neanderthal ancestry has shaped human genes  The research in Science found that genetic variants inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors are unevenly distributed across the human genome.  Some regions, which the scientists call “archaic deserts,” are devoid of Neanderthal genes. These deserts likely developed quickly after the two groups interbred, within 100 generations, perhaps because they resulted in birth defects or diseases that would have affected the survival chances of the offspring.  “It suggests that hybrid individuals who had Neanderthal DNA in these regions were substantially less fit, likely to due to severe disease, lethality, or infertility,” Capra said via email.  In particular, the X chromosome was a desert. Capra said the effects of Neanderthal variants that cause disease could be greater on the X chromosome, perhaps because it is present in two copies in females, but only present in one copy in males.  “The X chromosome also has many genes that are linked to male fertility when modified, so it has been proposed that some of this effect could have come from introgression leading to male hybrid sterility,” he said.  The Neanderthal gene variants detected most frequently in ancient and modern Homo sapiens genomes are related to traits and functions that included immune function, skin pigmentation and metabolism, with some increasing in frequency over time.  “Neanderthals were living outside Africa in harsh, ice age climates and were adapted to the climate and to the pathogens in these environments. When modern humans left Africa and interbred with Neanderthals, some individuals inherited Neanderthal genes that presumably allowed them to adapt and thrive better in the environment,” said Leonardo Iasi, co-lead author of the Science paper and a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.  The individuals living at Ranis had 2.9% Neanderthal ancestry, not dissimilar to most people today, the Nature study found.  The new timeline allows scientists to understand better when humans left Africa and migrated around the world. It suggested that the main wave of migration out of Africa was essentially done by 43,500 years ago because most humans outside Africa today have Neanderthal ancestry originating from this period, the Science study suggested.  However, there is still much scientists don’t know. It’s not clear why people in East Asia today have more Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans, or why Neanderthal genomes from this period show little evidence of Homo sapiens DNA.  While the genomes sequenced from the Ranis individuals are the oldest Homo sapiens ones, scientists have previously recovered and analyzed DNA from Neanderthal remains that date back 400,000 years.  Lost branch of the human family tree  The individuals who called the cave in Ranis home were among the first Homo sapiens to live in Europe.  These early Europeans numbered a few hundred and included a woman who lived 230 kilometers (143 miles) away in Zlatý kůň in the Czech Republic. DNA from her skull was sequenced in a previous study, and researchers involved in the Nature study were able to connect her to the Ranis individuals.  These individuals had dark skin, dark hair and brown eyes, according to the study, perhaps reflecting their relatively recent arrival from Africa. Scientists are continuing to study remains from the site to piece together their diet and how they lived.  The family group was part of a pioneer population that eventually died out, leaving no trace of ancestry in people alive today. Other lineages of ancient humans also went extinct around 40,000 years ago and disappeared just like the Neanderthals ultimately did, said Johannes Krause, director at the department of archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. These extinctions may suggest that Homo sapiens did not play a role in the demise of Homo neanderthalensis.  “It’s kind of interesting to see that human story is not always a story of success,” said Krause, a senior author of the Nature study."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/sport/lindsey-vonn-world-cup-skiing-return-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Lindsey Vonn to make World Cup skiing return in St. Moritz,"CNN —  Skiing great Lindsey Vonn has announced that she will make her World Cup return at St Moritz, Switzerland next weekend.  In a video posted by her sponsor, Red Bull, on Friday, the 40-year-old Vonn said: “So, I have some news. My body is finally put back together and I hear St Moritz is pretty nice this time of year.”  Vonn announced her retirement from competitive skiing in 2019 after 18 years on the World Cup circuit. In that time, she recorded 82 World Cup race wins, eight world championship medals and three Winter Olympic medals.  After undergoing successful partial knee replacement surgery earlier this year, the American star decided to return to ski racing.  “I feel stronger now than I did in my late 20s,” she said, per Reuters. “The passion for skiing has never gone away, I just wasn’t physically able to do it anymore.  “It was pretty soon after surgery and in the rehab process that I was already doing things that I hadn’t done in years,” she added.  “My body was just functioning better. Obviously, I am a lot happier because I’m not in pain 24 hours a day. I’m getting stronger and better and faster than I was for a long, long period of time.”  Vonn recently competed in lower-level events in Copper Mountain, Colorado in order to gain eligibility to compete at World Cup races.  According to The Associated Press, she will race in two super-G events in St. Moritz, where she has previously won five World Cup titles. The super-G competitions in the Swiss resort are scheduled to take place on December 21 and 22.  The US Ski Team confirmed to CNN that Vonn will compete in St. Moritz.  “One thing I realized is that life is really short,” Vonn said in the video posted by Red Bull. “If you have an opportunity, you have to take it. There’s nothing that I love more than ski racing.”  Vonn’s haul of 82 World Cup wins puts her third on the all-time list behind Sweden’s Ingemar Stenmark on 86 and compatriot Mikaela Shiffrin on 99."
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/christmas-railway-station-romance-chance-encounters/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,Her flight was delayed and she missed her train home for Christmas. Then she met her future husband on the platform,"CNN —  When frazzled twentysomething traveler Jennea arrived at London’s King’s Cross railway station on December 15, 2013, the station was absolutely packed.  Carol singers in one corner were singing with gusto, collecting money for charity in brightly colored buckets. Gathered in the middle of the Victorian concourse, crowds of travelers stood, wrapped in coats and scarfs, looking up at the departure boards, waiting for their platform to be announced.  Passengers jostled past each other, armed with bags of gifts and large suitcases. Exhausted and a little overwhelmed, Jennea still found time to be charmed by the festive atmosphere. She took a moment to put down her heavy bag and check the departure board, searching for her train.  Jennea, who’d grown up in the US, had spent the last 18 months in Mozambique, where she’d been volunteering for the US Peace Corps. She hadn’t seen her loved ones in almost two years, and now she was en route to reunite with them in Cambridge, England.  The thought of hugging her mom, catching up with her aunt and uncle and distributing her gifts to her family kept Jennea going as she hoisted her heavy backpack onto her back, and headed towards her platform.  “I was absolutely loaded down — two suitcases, a backpackers’ backpack, my handbag…” Jennea tells CNN Travel today. “It’s Christmastime. I’m packed to the brim with Christmas presents. Making my way through King’s Cross Station, completely absorbed.”  When Jennea got to the platform, it was unnervingly empty. This was surprising.  “I remember thinking, ‘This platform is very quiet. It’s so close to Christmas and it’s King’s Cross, that’s bizarre. I don’t even know if I’m in the right place. What if I’ve misread the platform number incorrectly?’”  Jennea glanced around for someone to ask. She couldn’t see a train guard or another passenger.  “And not only that, there were two trains on the platform as well.”  It wasn’t clear which was the right train.  Jennea felt herself start to panic. She was already leaving London much later than she’d initially planned. And she was exhausted from traveling from the Mozambique village where she was volunteering to Malawi, then to Kenya, then to the UK.  “It took four days,” Jennea recalls. “And even then, when I finally landed in London, there was this massive delay on the airplane.  “Because of this, I had missed my plan A train, my plan B train, my plan everything train… It was 2013 and I didn’t have an iPhone yet. I couldn’t get a hold of my aunt and uncle who were going to be picking me up.”  Just as Jennea felt the stress and tiredness start to overwhelm her, she heard a voice behind her.  “Excuse me, is this the train to Cambridge?”  A train station conversation  Jennea and Arthur immediately hit it off at King's Cross railway station in December 2013. Dreamcapture Fotografie  Jennea turned around and saw a man, also wrapped in a hat and scarf, but significantly less weighed down by luggage.  “I was so relieved,” recalls Jennea. “I replied, ‘Oh I hope it’s going to Cambridge. That’s where I’m going.’”  As she spoke, Jennea realized she hadn’t had a conversation in four days — other than perfunctory airport and airplane interactions. She felt a strange feeling of ease with this stranger, who smiled at her and offered to help her with her bags as they boarded the train together.  As Jennea apologized for the heaviness of her luggage and the guy told her not to worry about it, Jennea thought she detected something familiar in his voice.  “Are you American?” she asked.  “No, I’m Dutch,” he said, smiling. “But I live in London. I’m Arthur.”  “I’m Jennea,” said Jennea, smiling back.  In mutual, unspoken agreement, Jennea and Arthur — who have requested their last names not be included in this story for privacy reasons — sat down on the train, opposite one another. They carried on talking.  “It was just very easy conversation,” recalls Jennea.  The carriage gradually filled up, and an overhead announcement confirmed the train was heading to Cambridge.  Arthur asked Jennea what brought her to the UK, and Jennea explained her mother was Irish, that she had family in Ireland and the UK, and they were all gathering there for the festive period.  As for Arthur, he explained he’d moved to London for college a few years previously. He was currently working in finance while he studied part time for a PhD — and he wasn’t heading to Cambridge for the holidays, but for something a little more unusual.  “I’d been invited to go to Cambridge by a friend of mine who was a novice monk,” Arthur tells CNN Travel today. “He basically invited me to spend a few days as a mini retreat away from the Big Smoke.”  Arthur had approached Jennea on the platform because he was confused about the train.  “It was initially purely functional dialogue,” is how Arthur puts it. “Trying to get on the train, trying to get to Cambridge… but then it quickly morphed into a very easygoing conversation about lots of different topics. It felt like there was a lot of common ground.”  “People say, ‘Was it love at first sight?’” says Jennea, of that first interaction with Arthur. “And I say this lovingly, but no, no, it wasn’t. It was just relief: ‘Thank God there’s someone else on the platform.’ And then it was functional. ‘Okay, where am I going? What am I doing?’ But then we sat down, and started talking.”  For both Arthur and Jennea, this conversation was the hook. They were intrigued by each other. Arthur knew nothing about the Peace Corps. Jennea was fascinated by the idea of having a friend who was a monk. Their conversation just flowed.  As the train — now full of people — weaved its way through the series of tunnels that carry trains northward out of King’s Cross, Arthur and Jennea kept talking.  “There wasn’t that point where it became awkward and silent and you’re thinking, ‘Do I dig out my book and pretend to read now?’” says Jennea. “No. We chatted the entire time.”  About an hour later, the train pulled into Cambridge station, and Arthur helped Jennea gather her many bags. They exchanged details, promising to add one another on Facebook, and they were still deep in conversation as the train pulled to a halt.  “Then, as we stepped off onto the platform, my aunt and my uncle were actually right there, and I was so relieved because they’d waited for me,” says Jennea. “I hadn’t seen my family in years at this point, it had been a long time, so I just threw my arms around my uncle, and then my aunt.”  Meanwhile Arthur hung back, still holding Jennea’s suitcases.  “He was standing there with my bags — my aunt said, ‘Oh my gosh, look at you. You’ve gone all the way to Mozambique, and you’ve come back, and here’s a man standing with your bags. What have you done?’” recalls Jennea, laughing.  “It was kind of an, ‘Alright, bye,’ moment,” says Arthur, also laughing.  Arthur and Jennea didn’t hug farewell — they both suddenly felt a little awkward in that moment. But as they walked in opposite directions, they each turned around to smile at one another, and wave.  “I was sort of thinking, ‘Oh, that was really nice. What a great start to my Christmas holidays,’” recalls Jennea. “But I had no idea what would happen next.”  Staying in touch  Arthur and Jennea had lots in common from the outset and stayed in touch after their railway meeting. Arthur and Jennea  When Jennea got to her aunt’s house, she spent the next couple of hours catching up with her family, sharing stories of her mammoth journey and her work in Mozambique.  Later, when she finally connected to the Wi-Fi on her cell phone, Jennea saw she had a friend request from Arthur. She accepted, and he sent through a message right away, saying how great it was to meet her.  “And then we just kept exchanging Facebook messages back and forth over the holidays,” says Jennea. “I kept sneaking away into the room I was staying at my aunt’s house to try and message privately.”  Jennea and Arthur picked back up the conversation they’d started on the train, sending instant messages regularly back and forth. After a couple of days, they started talking on the phone.  A few days before Christmas, Jennea’s parents arrived in Cambridge.  “As soon as my mom arrived, my aunt said, ‘I think she’s met someone in the UK.’ And my mom was like, ‘Who did she meet? She’s only just landed?’” recalls Jenna. “And so then I always had a — very well-meaning, but nosy — relative, always coming into the bedroom, just putting laundry away, whenever I was on the phone with Arthur.”  “Which I would hear in the background, by the way, when we would be talking,” adds Arthur. “I’d suddenly hear, ‘Can you see me? I’m the pretty aunt.’”  Jennea was set to return to Mozambique early in the new year. She still had another 12 months of her Peace Corps contract. It wasn’t obvious where this connection with Arthur would or could go. But then Arthur invited Jennea to visit him in London for a couple of days before she returned.  “My mom was like, ‘Absolutely not. He could be an axe murderer. You just don’t know,’” says Jennea. “While my aunt was saying, ‘You’re just young once, and you only live once, so take a chance and see what happens.’”  Jennea tried not to be swayed by either of their opinions.  “I mean, as an adult, I was able to make my own decisions,” she points out.  Jennea knew she wanted to see Arthur again. So she got the train back from Cambridge to London, where Arthur was waiting, smiling, in the station concourse.  “We were in London together for just 24 hours,” says Arthur. “It was quite special. We were able to squeeze basically lots of different dates into that period of time.”  It was the end of December — that time between Christmas and the new year when many people in the UK are off work, the Christmas lights are still twinkling and there’s a sense of expectation in the air as January 31 gets ever closer. It was the perfect backdrop for falling in love.  “It was a very magical day,” says Jennea. “We went to different restaurants, museums, and saw a show.”  Arthur had planned out the whole day.  “And all the things that he had planned, they were things that I really enjoy doing as well,” says Jennea. “So there was this thought of, ‘What you like doing is what I like doing,.’”  “It was just one day in London. But it really sealed the deal.”  Arthur felt the same way, saying this time together, “helped establish a strong bond.”  But when Jennea left for Mozambique, she and Arthur promised to take “everything one day at a time.”  Neither of them had been looking for romance when they met. And both were conscious that Jennea living on another continent would be tough to navigate.  “My approach to it was, ‘If I keep talking to Arthur, that’s wonderful, and that’s great. And if not, I had a great time. Everything was lovely,’” says Jennea.  “And so I think because I wasn’t expecting and hoping and putting that pressure on, it always remained a very safe space, if that makes sense — super organic. It was just very relaxed, one day at a time without the pressure and I think the distance permitted that — but also knowing that the distance was temporary, I think that’s a really important mixture in starting a long-distance relationship.”  Jennea and Arthur kept in touch while she was away via regular phone calls.  “We would call and chat, building the relationship and getting to know each other,” says Jennea. “I looked forward to those phone calls. We’d ask: ‘What are your hopes and dreams for the future? What’s your family like? Do you have siblings? Happiest memory…’ That kind of thing… And also just, ‘How do you like your toast?’”  “Jennea was someone that liked going into depth on different things,” says Arthur. “And also someone I could laugh with. Someone with a sense of humor. I think that was very appealing.”  A few months in, Arthur visited Jennea in Mozambique in spring 2015.  “It was surreal when I saw Arthur again,” recalls Jennea. “I couldn’t believe he traveled across the world to come and visit me. I traveled six hours via public transport to meet him at the Nampula airport so it’s safe to say we were both feeling a little more invested in our relationship at that point.”  Jennea waited for Arthur at the airport holding “a giant homemade welcome sign for him in Dutch.”  The Mozambique visit was really exciting for both Arthur and Jennea, and further confirmed their certainty in the relationship and its potential future.  “It gave me a deep appreciation for the volunteering Jennea did, which really was a defining experience for her,” says Arthur.  And as the months rolled on, Jennea started considering what she’d do after her Peace Corps contract ended. She was interested in teaching, but wasn’t sure where she’d end up based.  “My original plan was to return to the US and to go into graduate school. And in the United States, you have to take an entrance exam in order to get into graduate school. So I convinced myself that it would be worth it to go to London and take this exam, because then I could stay with Arthur,” says Jennea.  In the moment, Jennea told herself — and everyone else in her life — that she was saving money by not having to pay for hotel accommodation, even though she could have done the exam somewhere closer and saved the plane fare.  “It was an excuse,” Jennea says. “I wasn’t fooling anyone. But then I went to London and stayed with Arthur for two weeks.”  During that period, Jennea talked to Arthur about her graduate school plans, and interest in teaching, but mentioned nothing was set in stone.  “I’m open to various options,” she told him.  “Well, you know, London is an option,” said Arthur.  Jennea raised an eyebrow, not sure what to make of this.  “I remember thinking, ‘What does that mean? I’m fully aware that I could move to London, but are you asking me to live with you?’” she says today. “And yes, that was his very romantic way of saying, ‘Will you live with me? London’s an option.’”  Life in London  After Jennea introduced Arthur to her extended family during a Minnesota-based Thanksgiving at the end of 2014 — a trip she calls “a lot of fun” — she made the choice to move to the UK to be with Arthur.  This decision was made a little easier thanks to Jennea’s mother’s Irish roots.  “Fortunately, I have dual-citizenship with Ireland and the USA,” she says. “I was therefore spared any visa hardships, luckily.”  And at the beginning of 2015, she moved into Arthur’s apartment in Poplar, east London — which he’d just purchased.  “The wallpaper was a bit 1970s, so we had this shared project of updating this flat together, and I think for us living together for the first time in this big city, and adjusting, it was helpful, because I wasn’t moving into his space right away. We were both starting out in this new space,” Jennea says.  “We were building new memories together, in a new area,” adds Arthur.  Jennea and Arthur moved in together in London in 2015. MoMi Photo  The couple also adopted a cat from Battersea Cats and Dogs Home, an animal rescue center in London.  “That was also really nice, because we had our little friend, and it was nice to come home to him,” says Jennea, who started training to become an elementary school teacher not long after she moved to the UK.  Life in London was an adjustment from her time in the Peace Corps — and living in the UK was also different from Jennea’s childhood in the US. But her Cambridge family weren’t too far away. And Jennea was excited to create her own family unit with Arthur.  “We were just very easy together,” she says. “It just felt cozy. It felt like home when we were together. I found security.”  When Jennea moved to London, she and Arthur and just celebrated their one year “meet-a-versary,” as she calls it.  As a gift, Arthur gave Jennea a ceramic tile, a type of traditional Dutch pottery, with a personalized inscription: “A phrase in Dutch that translates to, “The measurement of love is love without measurement.”  Underneath the words was the date Arthur and Jennea first met: December 15, 2013.  Proposal and marriage  Jennea and Arthur on their wedding day in Curacao. Arthur calls the day ""incredible and very memorable."" Claudia Sanches/Wow Wedding Details  After a couple of years enjoying London life, Arthur proposed to Jennea while they were on vacation in Bruges, Belgium.  “Arthur proposed after giving me a heartfelt letter about his love for me and got down on one knee,” says Jennea.  In the spring of 2017, Jennea and Arthur got married in Curacao, a Dutch Caribbean island.  “We chose a place that inconvenienced guests equally,” jokes Jennea before adding that they were attracted to the beauty of the island, and the fact it was “neither a ‘his’ nor ‘hers’ wedding destination.”  It was, says Arthur, “incredible and very memorable — having all of our closest family and friends in Curacao for a four day party.”  “For the entire week, when we walked down the street we always bumped into friends or family,” recalls Jennea.  “The day itself was sunny, clear blue skies and warm. I had had a sleepover with the bridesmaids/girls the night before and I was ready to party and say yes to living the rest of my life with Arthur by my side. It was just such a great buzz.”  The speeches included a couple of mentions of Arthur and Jennea’s unlikely train station meeting — including three of Arthur’s friends performing a little skit about the meeting, and the couple’s life together since.  “I have a lot of happy memories of that day. It’s definitely a moment in time I like to relive and enjoy,” says Jennea.  Arthur says he also felt “deeply happy” and also really “grateful” to be marrying Jennea.  Tougher times  From the early days of their relationship, Arthur and Jennea had talked about wanting children. The couple first discussed this mutual desire on one of their many long, in-depth cross-continental phone calls.  They figured once they were married, and more settled with careers and life, they’d start trying for kids.  “But this turned out to be very difficult,” says Jennea. “We really struggled with infertility, and that was something that was really hard, because everything else was so easy between us. When we started trying for kids, it just kind of felt ‘What’s wrong?’ This life we had envisioned together — it wasn’t necessarily clear whether or not we would ever have that.”  As the uncertainty and heartbreak stretched over several years, Jennea and Arthur navigated the ups and downs as a team.  “We’d be open about the challenges, having those conversations emotionally,” says Arthur. “But then also not being stuck in that anxiety or concern or frustration, but trying to convert that into, ‘Where do we go from here, together?’”  Arthur also credits the couple’s “wider social circle, family and friends” who helped support them through this period.  And then, in 2020, Jennea and Arthur had a successful round of IVF, welcoming a daughter.  “We got very lucky,” says Jennea.  A few years later, in summer 2023, the couple had a second child, a son.  “We have another little baby, also with the help of IVF,” says Jennea. “We just feel very fortunate to have what we have now.”  Life today  Jennea, Arthur and their two kids now live in the Netherlands. Arthur and Jennea  Today, Jennea and Arthur live in the Hague, in the Netherlands, with their two young children. The couple moved to Arthur’s home country when they became parents.  This was partly a career decision after Britain left the European Union, and partly a personal decision.  “Arthur’s career was moved from London to Amsterdam following Brexit, and then Arthur’s family also lives here,” explains Jennea. “So as I was pregnant and about to give birth, the thought was, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be nice to be closer to Arthur’s immediate family?’”  Today, says Jennea, the couple are nostalgic about their London life — “all the museums, going for drinks with your friends — there’s just so much going on in London, how could you not love it?”  They always enjoy returning — especially to King’s Cross station, where it all began.  “Kings Cross station definitely holds a special place in our hearts,” says Jennea. “We always hold hands and kiss when we walk through together. When we brought our daughter there the first time, that was a magical moment. I’m looking forward to bringing our son there in the future.”  It’s that wonderful festive energy, the exciting chaos, that engulfs the days leading up to Christmas that I associate with our love story. Jennea  Over a decade later, Jennea says she still thinks “meeting at a train station is romantic. It feels nostalgic in a way, like an old movie meet-cute.”  Jennea and Arthur also always associate the month of December with their love story.  “It’s that wonderful festive energy, the exciting chaos, that engulfs the days leading up to Christmas that I associate with our love story,” she says.  The couple always take a moment to “set aside time to be with just each other at this point in the year, and tell each other just how grateful we are that we met,” adds Jennea.  “To our friends/family, it has been compared to a Bollywood scene,” says Arthur, who adds he has a strong feeling that bumping into Jennea that day was “meant to be.”  “I honestly still count myself incredibly lucky because it was so serendipitous,” agrees Jennea.  “If things had gone to ‘plan’ — no delayed plane or luggage, not having missed my original trains to Cambridge, etc. I never would have met Arthur. Our paths just wouldn’t have crossed. We were living in two totally different worlds and this really feels like it was fate. Eleven years later, we’re still together and with two kids, all due to a chance encounter on a train platform.”"
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/science/december-full-moon/index.html,CNN,left,Politics,December full moon will shine bright this weekend. Here’s how to best view it,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  As the winter nights grow longer, those in the Northern Hemisphere will want to keep an eye out this weekend for the last full moon of the year. The silvery orb will shine bright in the sky for a hair more than 16 hours on Saturday evening into Sunday morning.  Known as the long night moon or the cold moon, it’s set to reach peak illumination at 4:02 a.m. ET Sunday, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. However, the moon will appear round to the naked eye for about three days, according to NASA.  For those in the Southern Hemisphere, which had a long visibility moon in June, the December full moon will appear for a shorter time and will follow a lower arch in the sky, said Sara Russell, research scientist and head of the Planetary Materials Group at London’s Natural History Museum.  “For those of us in the northern hemisphere, the Moon will seem to reach higher in the sky than you might expect,” Russell said in an email.  The sun, moon and Earth are on about the same plane, with the full moon occurring when Earth is between the moon and the sun as the moon orbits our planet. “In December, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, the Sun is low and has a short track across the sky, so the opposite Moon has a high and long track,” Russell added.  Observing the cold moon  The cold moon’s name is a nod to the bitter weather typically found in the Northern Hemisphere this time of year. The name comes from the Mohawk people, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac, which has names for each full moon that historically derive from Native Americans, Colonial Americans or other sources.  For best viewing of the cold moon, Russell recommended looking when it has just risen or is about to set to see it near the horizon. Wrap up in warm layers if you’re in colder weather and aim to look when there are clear skies in your area, she said.  “We are so lucky on Earth to have the Moon. There’s nowhere else in our Solar system where there is a planet and moon so proportionately close in size — the Moon is almost like our smaller twin,” Russell said. “It is better at preserving all of its history than is the surface of the Earth, and we can look up to its cratered surface to see how battered by impacts both the Moon and Earth have been over their 4.5 billion-year history.”  Those observing the moon can ponder the questions yet to be answered about the neighboring celestial object, such as the mysteries surrounding the far side of the moon, theories about the water-rich lunar poles or the possibility of humans one day living on permanent bases there, Russell said.  Upcoming celestial events  This year, the December full moon occurs one week before the winter solstice, an astronomical event caused by the Earth’s tilt, that marks the Northern Hemisphere’s longest night and shortest day and vice versa for the Southern Hemisphere.  This year’s winter solstice, when Earth’s axis is tilted the farthest away from the sun, will be at 4:21 a.m. ET December 21, according to EarthSky.  The next full moon will be the wolf moon on January 25, according to the Farmers’ Almanac.  Meanwhile, there are two meteor showers to close out the year; the Geminids will be seen blazing in the night sky until the shower’s finality on December 21, while the Ursids will peak December 21-22, according to the American Meteor Society."

Don’t cancel your flight just yet,"Editor’s note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.  CNN —  In travel news this week: the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards, why you shouldn’t gift-wrap methamphetamine, plus infrastructure megaprojects around the world.  Bridge and tunnel crowd  There’s been a whole bunch of international infrastructure projects in the news this week, with a strong focus on digging.  Busy beavers and merry moles have been chattering about resurfaced plans for a $20 trillion transatlantic tunnel that could theoretically link London and New York in just an hour using vacuum tube technology. That’s 3,000 miles of burrowing, mind, which Newsweek estimates could take the best part of a millennium if construction proceeded at the same rate as Europe’s Channel Tunnel.  In plans that are actually happening, Norway broke ground last month on its Rogfast project, which promises to be the world’s longest, deepest undersea road tunnel. Elsewhere in northern Europe, the world’s longest road and rail tunnel, the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel between Denmark and Germany, is slated to open in 2029.  Southern Europe isn’t shy of a project or two, either. Construction of a new bridge linking Greece and Turkey might be closer to getting underway, the Greek Reporter said Friday.  Over near the western end of Europe, the UK is busy building one of the world’s most expensive railway projects, known as HS2 (High Speed 2), which now costs an almighty $416 million per mile. However, many people think it’s pointless.  That comes a few years after the UK resurfaced plans for what would have been one of the world’s most ambitious bridges, linking Britain and Ireland. It was to cross just a 12-mile stretch, but the waters were deep enough to submerge the Eiffel Tower. Then there was the matter of all the radioactive waste and unexploded munitions. Unsurprisingly, plans were dropped.  Baggage blues  A top musician who played at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was forced to cancel a concert this week after Air Canada refused to give his multi-million-dollar cello a seat on the plane.  For others, the trouble only starts at the baggage carousel, although there’s progress on easing some of the pain of that. United Airlines has rolled out a new way to track lost luggage with AirTags, with users being able to share location information directly with the airline. Other carriers, including Delta, Lufthansa and Qantas, are set to follow suit.  Finally, Japan Airlines has announced a baggage delivery service for travelers that will allow luggage to be dropped off at customers’ hotels for a fee. The idea is to reduce overcrowding on Tokyo’s public transport.  Naughty or nice?  It’s always a bad idea to put wrapped Christmas presents in your airplane luggage – if they raise concerns with airport security, they’re likely to be unwrapped.  It’s an even worse idea when the “presents” are actually 10 kilos of methamphetamine, as happened at a New Zealand airport this week.  This Christmas, we hope that your holidays are not felonious, but felicitous — like American Jennea and Dutchman Arthur.  Jennea’s flight from Mozambique was delayed and she missed her train out of London to see her loved ones for Christmas. Then she met her future husband on the platform.  Should you have the misfortune of finding yourself similarly in the winter chill this holiday season, but without the comfort of a lover’s hand to hold, you can always console yourself with a pair of heated gloves.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.  CNN —  “Even though you want to try to, never grow up,” Peter Pan said in the titular novel by J.M. Barrie, echoing a sentiment long expressed by the human race in an effort to cheat death.  The quest to unlock the secrets of longevity has been the topic of scientific study for decades. And some of the greatest lessons about living a long life come from nature itself.  Take Jonathan the giant tortoise, for instance. It is believed that the tortoise, a resident of the remote South Atlantic island of St. Helena, was likely born in 1832 — but he may be more than 200 years old since the exact date of his birth remains unknown.  Although blind and lacking a sense of smell, Jonathan still has sharp hearing for his advanced age and sunbathes during mild weather.  But even though giant tortoises are known for their exceptionally long lives, they may be outranked by an elusive creature of the deep.  Ocean secrets  A Greenland shark is seen swimming beneath the ice near northern Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. Avalon.red/Alamy Stock Photo  The rarely seen Greenland shark is a sluggish creature, slowly swimming through the deep waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The polar fish is the only species of shark that can withstand the freezing temperatures year-round.  The large sharks also live to be more than 400 years old, and some of them may have been alive since colonial times.  After mapping and studying their extraordinary genomes, scientists think the sharks’ unusually long lifespans are rooted in their unique genetic makeup — with insights that could be used to extend human lifespans.  Other worlds  The “Black Beauty” meteorite opened a window into studying ancient Mars when it was found in the Sahara Desert in 2011.  Astronomers believe the space rock was ejected from the Martian surface 5 million to 10 million years ago. And now, a single mineral grain inside the meteorite has revealed the oldest direct evidence of water on Mars 4.45 billion years ago.  The mineral grain was altered by hot water on Mars, which suggests that habitable environments such as hot springs may have existed on the red planet early in its history.  Meanwhile, the Perseverance rover just completed its 3 ½-month ascent up the steep rim of Jezero Crater on Mars, spotting an unusual zebra-striped rock along the way. Next up? The robotic explorer will investigate the oldest rocks on Mars to uncover more about the planet’s mysterious past.  Wild kingdom  A monarch butterfly drinks nectar from a flower in the pollinator habitat bed near the Chicago Park District storehouse in August. Tess Crowley/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images  With distinctive orange-and-black wings, monarch butterflies are easy to spot as they flit among the flowers, helping pollinate plants and encouraging biodiversity.  But monarch populations have seen a steep decline due to insecticides, habitat loss and the climate crisis — troubling enough that the US Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed adding the fragile species to the threatened species list.  If the butterflies receive the designation, more action could be taken to protect the important pollinators. But officials warn that without action, monarchs could vanish before the end of the century with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems.  Fantastic creatures  When a creature washed ashore in New Zealand in July, experts wondered whether it might be a spade-toothed whale, the world’s rarest whale that’s considered to be almost mythical because it has never been seen alive at sea.  Now, scientists studying the remains have confirmed the “really stocky, powerful-looking little animal” is indeed one of the elusive marine mammals, said Anton van Helden, an expert on some of the world’s rarest whales.  The carcass, studied by whale scientists and members of the local Māori community, yielded precious clues about the deep-sea-diving animal.

Tom Björklund/Max Planck Institute  Ancient DNA retrieved from bone fragments found in a cave beneath a medieval castle have helped scientists pinpoint when prehistoric humans encountered Neanderthals and made babies with them.  The bones belonged to a mother, daughter and distant cousins who lived in what’s now eastern Germany about 45,000 years ago. Their genomes revealed evidence of Neanderthal ancestry, meaning that early Homo sapiens living in the region mated with Neanderthals 1,500 years earlier.  “We were far more similar than we were different,” said Priya Moorjani, assistant professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley.  “They seem to have mixed with each other for a long period of time.”  In addition to shedding light on the shared history between humans and Neanderthals, the study also showed that the fragments belonged to a lost branch of the human family tree.

Police were called to a bar in Victoria in central London – a short walk from the palace – on Tuesday evening when a festive celebration turned violent.  A 24-year-old woman, who has not been identified, was arrested on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and of being drunk and disorderly, London’s Metropolitan Police told CNN.  The woman, who subsequently spent Tuesday night and much of the following day in a police cell, is believed to be a maid at the palace and was on a night out with around 50 members of palace staff at the time, according to The Sun newspaper.

She reportedly smashed some glasses and turned on a member of the bar staff.  Management at the royal residence say the matter is now being investigated and that disciplinary action could follow.  A palace spokesperson told the BBC: “We are aware of an incident outside the workplace involving a number of Household staff who had previously attended an early evening reception at the Palace.  “While this was an informal social gathering, not an official Palace Christmas party, the facts will be fully investigated, with a robust disciplinary process followed in relation to individual staff and appropriate action taken.”  The spokesperson told the BBC that the post-reception drinks, which staff went on to at the bar, were informal and had not been arranged by the palace.  A palace spokesperson confirmed the statement to CNN.  A spokesperson for London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed the incident to CNN in an email, saying: “At 21:21hrs on Tuesday, 10 December officers were called to a bar in Victoria Street, SW1 following reports that a customer had smashed glasses and attempted to assault a member of staff.  “Officers attended and arrested a 24-year-old woman on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly.  “She was taken into custody and released the following evening having been given a penalty notice for disorder.”"
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/world/israel-syria-golan-mount-hermon/index.html,CNN,left,International,Why Israel captured Syria’s tallest mountain just hours after Assad fell,"CNN —  Israel wasted no time after Bashar al-Assad’s fall to bomb all the Syrian military assets it wanted to keep out of the rebels’ hands – striking nearly 500 targets, destroying the navy, and taking out, it claims, 90% of Syria’s known surface-to-air missiles.  But it is Israel’s capture of Syria’s highest peak, the Mount Hermon summit, that may prove among the most lasting prizes – though officials have insisted that its occupation is temporary.  “This is the highest place in the region, looking upon Lebanon, upon Syria, Israel,” said Efraim Inbar, director of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS). “It’s strategically extremely important. There is no substitute for mountains.”  Israeli armored vehicles at the demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights. Matias Delacroix/AP  The summit of Mount Hermon lies in Syria, in a buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces for fifty years until last weekend, when Israeli troops took control of it. Until Sunday, the summit was demilitarized and patrolled by UN peacekeepers – their highest permanent position in the world.  Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, on Friday ordered the military to prepare for the harsh conditions of winter deployment. “Due to developments in Syria, it is of immense security importance to maintain our control over the summit of Mount Hermon,” he said in a statement.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has advanced beyond the summit, as far as Beqaasem, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Syrian capital, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. CNN could not independently confirm that claim. An Israeli military spokesperson this week denied that forces were “advancing toward” Damascus.  Israeli artillery on Mount Hermon in 1974. Alain Dejean/Sygma/Getty Images  Israel captured the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau in southwestern Syria that abuts Mount Hermon, in the 1967 war and has occupied it since. Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981. The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration.  Israel has for decades held some lower slopes of Mount Hermon, and even operates a ski resort there, but the peak remained in Syria proper.  “We have no intention to intervene in Syria’s internal affairs,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video days after Israel bombed hundreds of Syrian targets and seized the demilitarized buffer zone. “But we certainly intend to do everything necessary to take care of our security.”  Mount Hermon’s summit is a tremendous asset under Israel’s control. At 9,232 feet (2,814 meters), it is higher than any point in Syria or Israel, and second to only one peak in Lebanon.  “People sometimes say in the age of missiles, land is not important – it’s simply untrue,” Inbar said.  In an academic paper published in 2011, he wrote of the many advantages presented by Mount Hermon.  “It enables the use of electronic surveillance deep into Syrian territory, giving Israel early-warning capacity in case of an impending attack,” he wrote. Advanced technological alternatives like airborne surveillance, he argued, was simply not comparable. “In contrast to an installation on a mountain, these cannot carry heavy equipment such as big antennas, and they can be shot down by anti-air missiles.”  Israeli military forces on Mount Hermon on Sunday. Social Media  The peak is just over 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) from Damascus, which means that control of its Syrian foothills – also now in IDF hands – put the Syrian capital within range for artillery cannons.  The Israeli prime minister has said his “hand is extended” to the new government in Syria. But in the post-October 7 world, he and other national security heavyweights have made clear they are not going to take any chances.  “Mostly, it’s a comfort for us,” retired Brigadier General Israel Ziv said of Israel’s operations in Syria. “We have learned what happened in other countries when you have a terror organization that captures military equipment.”  Netanyahu has also insisted that the occupation is temporary. “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7 style attacks,” he said. His criteria for withdrawing, he said, was a Syrian force “that is committed to the 1974 agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed.”  It is unclear when that may be achieved.  Whether the military withdraws “is a political decision,” Inbar said. “The military would love to stay there.”  Mike Schwartz and Tim Lister contributed to this report."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/middleeast/can-islamist-rebels-govern-syria-intl/index.html,CNN,left,International,Can Syria’s Islamist rebels govern the country? Their rule in Idlib offers clues,"CNN —  When Syria’s rebel-appointed prime minister sat down with officials from the ousted Assad regime for the first time on Tuesday, the backdrop included the flag of the Syrian revolution alongside another bearing the Islamic declaration of faith that is often displayed by jihadists.  The choice of optics for the rebels’ first publicized cabinet meeting to discuss the transition of power since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime sparked controversy, with sceptics taking to social media to criticize the move.  The rebels may have taken note. In a later televised interview with Al Jazeera, caretaker Prime Minister Mohammad Al Bashir, who until this week ruled the small, conservative province of Idlib on the rebels’ behalf, appeared only with the new Syrian flag.  How the rebels governed Idlib, in northwest Syria, offers insight into how they might rule the country. Experts and residents of Idlib describe their governance as pragmatic and influenced by both internal and external pressure, with efforts to distance themselves from a jihadist past and gain international acceptance. However, their rule was far from democratic or liberal. Governing a large, diverse nation like Syria, they warn, will be an entirely different challenge.  Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that led the rebel offensive to topple the Assad regime and is proscribed as a terrorist organization by the United States, has opted to rule from the shadows. Jolani, who now uses his real name Ahmad al-Sharaa, picked a technocrat – Bashir – to lead Syria in the interim. He has said his officials gained valuable experience while governing Idlib but acknowledged that may not be enough.  “They (rebels) started from nothing, Idlib is small and without resources but thank God we were able to do really good things in the past… their experience is not zero and there are (areas) they were successful in,” Jolani told Mohammed Jalali, Assad’s prime minister, in a meeting on Monday to discuss the transfer of power. “However, we cannot do without the old (guard) and we have to benefit from them.”  Syrian caretaker Prime Minister Mohamed al-Bashir attends a meeting with the transitional cabinet after Syrian rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday. AL ARABIYA TV/Reuters  In just 13 days, Jolani’s ministers went from ruling the small province of Idlib to aspiring to govern Syria following its first regime change in six decades. Experts and residents who lived under the rebel-led Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) say the inexperienced cabinet will need to significantly adapt if they are to lead the transitional period effectively.  Dr. Walid Tamer, a resident of Idlib who witnessed the province’s transformation under rebel rule and said he personally interacted with Jolani, commended the SSG’s governance in Idlib, saying freedom of expression was protected. But he cautioned that the rebels aren’t prepared to rule the rest of the country.  “You went from governing Idlib to governing an entire nation… I don’t think the capabilities of the government we saw are enough for the task of governing the whole of Syria,” said Tamer, the head of northern Syria’s Free Doctors Union who describes himself as a liberal.  Idlib was “very safe” under the SSG, he said, adding that the rebels placed no restrictions on travel and movement inside the HTS-controlled province.  “Syria as a whole was a difficult place to live in, but the (SSG) never interfered in your personal life. Products were available and no limitations were imposed on your clothing or how you lived your life,” he said.  Life in the province was not one of prosperity, however. Abdel Latif Zakoor, a resident of Idlib who lived under rebel rule but has now moved to Turkey, told CNN the economic conditions under the SSG were “very difficult.”  “There wasn’t enough work, and a lot of people just stayed at home,” he said.  Taking control  When Jolani expanded his influence in Idlib in 2017, he eliminated rival Islamist groups and backed a new project to install a civilian government made up of local technocrats and academics, breaking from other jihadist methods that saw religious coercion under the rule of the sword in territories they captured.  “Before the Salvation Government you had many different factions that had their own courts of justice, prisons and social services,” Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst who has researched HTS for the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think tank, told CNN. “It imposed itself on other factions and took out their governing responsibilities.”  Displaced Syrians arrive from Lebanon to Idlib on October 10. In the center of the picture, the minister of interior in the Syrian Salvation Government, affiliated with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Muhammad Abd al-Rahman, appears as he inspects the registration procedures for displaced Syrians fleeing Lebanon. Ghaith Alsayed/Getty Images  Upon its establishment in 2017, the SSG issued a communique outlining four principles, one of which was that Islamic Sharia law is the “sole source of legislation,” emphasizing the need to “maintain the people’s Syrian and Islamic identity,” Al Jazeera reported.  The SSG operated as a functional government, holding publicized cabinet meetings with suited officials, issuing press statements and overseeing eleven ministries, including justice, sports, and education. It collected taxes, managed Idlib’s limited resources to govern 4 million people, and coordinated with international humanitarian groups to deliver aid to the 3 million displaced people in the region.  But the government wasn’t democratically elected, with ministers appointed through the approval of the shura, or consultative council, made up of prominent local figures, some of whom were selected by Jolani’s HTS. No women served in SSG leadership positions during its seven years of rule.  “It’s an Islamic governance in a technocratic way. What they wanted to do is control how religion is understood and how it’s implemented,” said Drevon.  A United Nations report from 2022 painted a grim picture of what life under HTS’ leadership was like.  “People were detained following comments made in private conversations pertaining to the cost of living or religious matters,” the UN Human Rights Council report on Syria said. “These comments were qualified as slander and blasphemy, with the latter leading to a sentence of one year of imprisonment.” Authorities “continued to arrest women for being ‘inappropriately’ dressed, and for non-compliance with entertainment-related bans.”  Tamer, who said he negotiated with HTS and SSG officials over medical matters, said that over the years, Jolani took a back seat in the daily affairs of the government and gave it more agency, only intervening on larger issues that endangered his group’s influence.  Rule by decree  Lacking a constitution or an elected legislature, the rebels ruled Idlib by decree, setting up a hybrid civil-Islamic court structure that included defense lawyers, a prosecutor and an appeals process.  Jolani was pragmatic in adapting to the requirements of the society he ruled over, Drevon said. Responding to the public’s displeasure, he slowly phased out the strict application of Islamic law, turned a blind eye to gender mixing and smoking and allowed protests against him. A Sharia law-based morality unit was disbanded but women were encouraged to cover their hair.  “It was a successful project in practice because there was also some buy in from the population. It was stable, the economy was working better (than the rest of Syria) and even the type of authoritarianism was nothing compared to Assad’s family,” Drevon said.  But there were exceptions. Last year, the SSG issued a “morality decree” instructing children to adhere to an Islamic dress code and limiting music in educational facilities. Jolani intervened to freeze the decree, fearing that an international uproar could affect aid donations, Drevon said.  Another issue was the arrest and alleged torture of dissidents that caused significant protests against Jolani in Idlib last year. Jolani told CNN last week that abuses in prisons “were not done under our orders or directions” and that HTS had already penalized the perpetrators.  Drevon said that Syria’s transition to democracy is going to be a lengthy and complicated process after six decades of dictatorship.  “It was a very new form of governance (in Idlib),” he said. “You can’t expect an armed group in war controlling a region that’s very tiny to create a social democratic system… They had to be realistic on what’s possible at war. Syria hasn’t had democracy in five, six decades. You will not become democratic in one week.”"

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/europe/lutsenko-ukraine-replaces-commander-russia-intl-latam/index.html,CNN,left,International,Ukraine replaces commander following Russian advances on key city of Pokrovsk,"CNN —  The commander of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk group of forces has been replaced following Russian advances in the region, a military official said Saturday.  General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy would take over as head of the operational and tactical group, replacing General Oleksandr Lutsenko, the official told CNN.  The move comes after Lutsenko faced heavy criticism for failing to stop recent Russian advances on the key city of Pokrovsk.  Russian forces have been spotted just three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the city, according to Ukrainian mapping service DeepState.  Pokrovsk has been the site of some of the fiercest battles on the eastern front for months, as Russia attempts to close in on the city.  Lying around 11 miles from Ukraine’s Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, it is a strategic target for Moscow.  Its fall to Russian forces would mark the largest setback for Ukraine in months and compound Ukraine’s struggles to get off the backfoot while Russian troops pile severe pressure on the eastern front lines.  Losing it would also add to the anxiety Ukraine’s military faces over the looming Donald Trump presidency in the United States, which has raised the risk that military aid from Kyiv’s largest source could dry up as the grinding conflict approaches its fourth year.  Elsewhere in the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that Moscow’s forces had begun to deploy a “significant” number of North Korean soldiers in its effort to drive Ukraine’s army out of Russia’s Kursk region.  Ukraine launched an incursion into Kursk in August and still retains some settlements there.  “Today, there is already preliminary evidence that the Russians have begun to use soldiers from North Korea in assaults – a significant number of them,” Zelensky said.  “The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in the Kursk region,” Zelensky said, adding there had already been “noticeable” losses among these soldiers.  He added that Ukraine had information that North Korean soldiers may be being used along other parts of the front line."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/asia/south-korea-yoon-second-impeachment-hnk-intl/index.html,CNN,left,International,South Korea’s parliament votes to impeach president over martial law debacle,"Seoul, South Korea CNN —  South Korea’s parliament voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday in an extraordinary rebuke that came about after his own ruling party turned on him following his refusal to resign over his short-lived martial law attempt.  It is the second time in less than a decade that a South Korean leader has faced impeachment proceedings in office and means Yoon is suspended from exercising his powers until the decision is finally adjudicated by the country’s Constitutional Court.  Following the vote, which sparked jubilation among protesters outside parliament, Yoon conceded that he will “stop temporarily for now, but the journey to the future that I’ve walked with the people for the past two years should not stop.”  “I will not give up,” he said in a statement shared by the country’s presidential office.  “With all the encouragement and support for me in mind, I will do my best until the last moment for the nation,” he added.  The country’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who will serve as acting president under South Korean law, told reporters that he would “devote all my strength and effort to stable operation of state affairs.”  Kang Sun-woo, a lawmaker with the Democratic Party, told CNN Saturday that the “great democracy of South Korea will survive and will be born again” after the impeachment.  The dramatic decision marks the culmination of a stunning political showdown after Yoon briefly declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers to parliament, where lawmakers fought past troops to enter the building and vote down the decree.  Yoon’s gamble backfired spectacularly, galvanizing many in the vibrant Asian democracy to call for his removal.  Opposition parties tried impeaching him a week ago – but Yoon survived after members of his ruling People Power Party boycotted the vote, saying they hoped the president would voluntarily resign instead.  Yoon then doubled down – giving a defiant speech on Thursday in which he defended his martial law decision, lambasted the opposition, claimed he was trying to save the country and vowed to “fight until the last moment with the people.”  Yet moments before that speech, the leader of Yoon’s party withdrew his support for the president and backed impeachment as the “only way… to defend democracy”, instructing lawmakers to vote with their conscience.  Thousands of protesters gathered in Seoul on Saturday, braving the cold to call for Yoon to resign ahead of the vote, which was passed by 204 lawmakers with 85 voting against it.  “He surely tried to have a war against the citizens so this is just what he deserved,” one protestor, Lim Dong Eon, told CNN outside the National Assembly building after the vote, where protesting has now turned into partying.  Another protestor kept their message short, telling CNN: “Democracy is back!”  Protesters participate in a rally calling for Yoon's impeachment in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14. Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters  People celebrate after the South Korean parliament passed an impeachment motion against Yoon on December 14. Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters  Meanwhile, thousands of the president’s supporters gathered in downtown Seoul, with many waving US and South Korean flags, chanting slogans and holding up signs in support of the embattled Yoon.  Yoon, who has been immediately suspended of his powers, now awaits a ruling by the Constitutional Court – one of the country’s highest courts – to confirm his fate, which can take up to six months.  Acting chief justice of the Constitutional Court, Moon Hyung-bae, said in a statement Saturday that a meeting will take place on Monday to discuss the case schedule, adding that the process will be conducted “swiftly and fairly.”  If confirmed, he will become the second South Korean president to be thrown out of office by impeachment after Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female leader.  The now acting president, Han Duck-soo, also faces his own political problems and is being investigated over his role in the martial law decision, adding to the political uncertainty in the weeks ahead.  A former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office, mired in low approval ratings and political scandals involving his wife and political appointments.  Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the Democratic Party, speaks during the plenary session for the impeachment vote at the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14 Woohae Cho/Pool/AFP/Getty Images  Since he took office in 2022 he has also faced political gridlock with an opposition-majority parliament – which prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill.  His administration cracked down what he referred to as “fake news” with police and prosecutors raiding multiple media outlets, including MBC and JTBC, as well as the homes of journalists.  Yoon argued that his frustration with the political deadlock drove him to take a bold power move, surprising not only members of his own party but also many military leaders.  Police raids and treason investigations  In his late-night address declaring martial law, Yoon accused the opposition of “anti-state” activities and being in cahoots with North Korea, without providing evidence – a charge his opponents have strenuously denied. He also portrayed his act as the only way to break the political deadlock in parliament.  But it was met with shock and anger across the country, which remains deeply scarred by the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it transitioned into hard-won democracy in the 1980s.  Dramatic scenes from that night showed security forces breaking through windows in the National Assembly to try and prevent lawmakers from gathering, and protesters confronting riot police.  Soldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on December 4, after Yoon's declaration of martial law. Jung Yeon-je/AFP/Getty Images  Since then, pressure on the president has grown, with police, parliament, prosecutors and the anti-corruption body launching separate investigations into Yoon on treason allegations. On Tuesday, lawmakers approved a special counsel to investigate whether Yoon committed insurrection and abused his power by issuing martial law.  The following day, South Korean police raided the presidential office, a presidential security official confirmed to CNN. Yoon has also been barred from leaving the country.  Last week, South Korean prosecutors detained former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who allegedly recommended the martial law imposition and resigned in the wake of the scandal. Kim attempted to end his own life in custody late Tuesday, according to the head of the country’s correctional service.  On Thursday, Yoon said he had only discussed the martial law decree with Kim before declaring it. Meanwhile parliament has already impeached both Yoon’s justice minister and his police chief.  Senior government officials have testified at various government hearings over the last week revealing some extraordinary details about the night of the martial law order.  Special Warfare Command Commander Kwak Jong-geun testified that he received a direct order from President Yoon to break the doors of the National Assembly and drag out the lawmakers, but he did not comply.  South Korea, one of East Asia’s most important economies and vital US regional ally, now faces months of protracted political uncertainty of the kind that dominated the country during the last impeachment crisis in 2016 and 2017.  Then-president Park Geun-hye was ultimately impeached by lawmakers over corruption allegations, kicked out of office by the Constitutional Court, jailed and later pardoned.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/entertainment/chappell-charli-sabrina-pop-cec/index.html,CNN,left,International,"Pop music is messier, for the better, because of Chappell Roan, Charli XCX and Sabrina Carpenter","CNN —  This year brought us new albums from some of the biggest artists in the world: Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift all put out music that thrilled fans.  And yet some of the most impactful pop music of 2024 came not from Tay or Bey, but from three rising pop stars whose songs took us out to the clubs (Pink Pony and otherwise) and back home to the bedroom. They embraced romantic ugliness and cutting self-reflection — and pushed pop forward.  The year arguably belonged to Charli XCX, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter.  “People like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, who’ve dominated for so long — they have a sheen and a polish to them that’s somewhat unrelatable as a listener,” said Sam Murphy, a music curator who analyzes and dissects pop on his popular TikTok account. “What people really craved this year, the TikTok generation, was to see more mess and chaos in people’s lives. We wanted pop stars that we were able to see the flaws within and the charisma coming out.”  The year saw Charli, a boundary-pushing yet oft-overlooked pop veteran, finally escape what the New York Times once called “pop’s middle class” with her defiant, sweat-soaked, goopy-green opus, “Brat.”  This year, Carpenter went from a supporting act on the highest-grossing tour in history to a leading lady herself, with her endearingly silly, sexy songs topping the charts. (Here’s where she’d make a sex joke.)  And it was the year when everyone wanted to take things H-O-T T-O G-O, dance in the Pink Pony Club and wish their exes good luck, babe. Roan’s debut album came out over a year ago, but it rapidly grew an audience this year as she took her act on the road and won us over.  We loved this trio of stars because they weren’t impenetrable like Beyoncé or as towering as Swift. These artists were accessible to us, interacting with fans online and touring prolifically. Their music was personal and specific, with confessional lyrics about self-hatred, unrequited love and lust.  It helps, of course, that their music is exciting and compulsively listenable, said Mike Errico, a musician and visiting assistant arts professor at New York University’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, who teaches songwriting.  “The songs are great. They’re great writers and vocalists, and they’re working with great teams,” Errico said. “ But they also have something very urgent to say.”  None of these women became stars overnight — they’ve been recording music since they were teenagers, steadily building an audience who jibed with their unique sound. Their music doesn’t reinvent pop. But by adding their unique flavors to a well-trodden genre that’s been stuck in a rut of sameness, they’re forcing it into a looser, freer future.  “It’s been a while since there’s been a changing of the guards for people at the top,” Murphy said.  Fans want authenticity — and these artists delivered  Charli XCX belts at a Denmark music festival in July. Joseph Okpako/WireImage/Getty Images  There will always be room for artists like Swift, who’s “etched a place in history that can’t be erased,” Murphy said. But her titanic popularity has led to some “fatigue” among pop fans, he said.  “I think there’s a level of polish that is really reflective of a bygone era of pop that people aren’t relating to,” Murphy said.  Part of why Charli, Roan and Carpenter are so magnetic is because their music wasn’t made for everyone. They weren’t the biggest pop stars in the world when they were writing their breakthrough albums, so they weren’t beholden to an audience of millions. They’ve each cultivated a sound so specific that it can’t be mistaken for anything else.  “The ubiquitous, all-satisfying pop star has disappeared, and instead these niches are becoming bigger and bigger,” Murphy said. “I think that’s why it worked, that push that kept so much on that niche fanbase. It became so big to the point that it was able to start penetrating the mainstream conversation.”  Mainstream, indeed. Some of the biggest songs of the year were made by this pop trifecta. “Espresso,” especially, was inescapable, as Spotify’s most-streamed song globally with over 1.6 billion plays. “Good Luck, Babe!” also scored over one billion streams, and it was Roan’s only new single of the year.  The craving for authentic pop stars reminds Murphy of the “transition from Instagram to TikTok, where your Instagram feed was all about being polished and showing the incredible life that you were leading, even if things were really falling apart behind the scenes.”  On TikTok, meanwhile, users approach their content with inspiring candor, sharing their lives, warts and all, he said.  Charli, Roan and Carpenter take the same approach to their music. Their respective breakout albums, “Brat,” “The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess” and “Short n’ Sweet,” are all deeply personal, vibrant and, crucially, danceable records. That their voices or hearts might break along the way only adds to their considerable charms.  Works from established artists who have a quality and reputation to uphold, like Grande’s “Eternal Sunshine” or Lipa’s “Radical Optimism” — even “Cowboy Carter” and “The Tortured Poets Department,” which are both nominated for album of the year at the Grammys — ”all just got blown out of the water by these moments that felt more exciting,” Murphy said.  Live performances going viral helped artists like Chappell become stars  TikTok virality can turn a song into a hit, but it’s the art of performance that turns an artist into a star.  “I don’t think what happened to Chappell this year (would have) happened without her live stage presence,” Murphy said.  Roan cut her teeth on Olivia Rodrigo’s “Guts” tour earlier this year before joining the lineups of spring and summer musical festivals. We watched as her star rose steadily with every performance: In April, a clip of Roan performing the bridge of “Good Luck, Babe!” dressed in sleazy latex and leather at Coachella won new fans who went back and discovered her debut album. Four months later, at Lollapalooza, she played to the largest crowd in the festival’s history — organizers said as many as 110,000 people may’ve been in her audience.  Chappell Roan, pictured performing in Tennessee in October, had a busy touring schedule this year. With every tour stop, her audience grew. Jason Kempin/Getty Images  “We were watching that growth in real time, in tandem with incredible presentations of her music live,” Murphy said. “It’s difficult to imagine that kind of thing happening even five years ago, pre-pandemic.”  Carpenter’s trajectory was similar, supporting Swift on the Eras Tour before making some festival stops on her own and releasing the smash that introduced us all to the nonsensical phrase “that me espresso.”  These artists are meeting audiences where they’re at, which is, overwhelmingly, on TikTok. Charli and Chappell regularly connect with their fans on the platform, candidly delivering news directly to followers in a video instead of a manager-approved statement.  They also shirk the traditional promotional model of aiming for radio play to grow their fanbases, said music writer Reanna Cruz, who’s written for New York magazine, Rolling Stone and NPR. Now, radio is trying to play catch-up with the young fans it used to influence.  “We’re seeing younger artists that know how to access those hyper-online audiences more effectively have more success,” Cruz said.  We’re living the adjustment to mega-fame with the stars, too. Charli took a victory lap with the remix album “Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat,” on which she warped her original songs into meditations on sudden superstardom. Roan’s public grappling with invasions of privacy sparked conversations about how much stars owe their fans. And clips from Carpenter’s tour routinely go viral, most recently when Marcello Hernandez of “Saturday Night Live” stopped by, in character, as doctor-model-loverboy Domingo.  They have clear POVs that speaks to our time  Over the last decade, hip-hop has reigned as the most popular genre, Cruz and Murphy said, where innovation thrived and stars were reliably discovered. Until this year, pop, with a few exceptions, had been stuck in a rut.  The genre has been suffering from sameness throughout the back-half of the 2010s and into the 2020s, when many artists tried to appeal to all kinds of listeners without carving out their own recognizable sound. There was still room for breakouts like Lipa, Rodrigo and Billie Eilish, plus artists that blended pop and hip-hop, like Doja Cat and SZA, but pop was overwhelmingly plagued by monotony.  Enter Charli, Roan and Carpenter. While their sounds are clearly influenced by earlier acts — “Good Luck, Babe!” builds to a Kate Bush-style bridge; Carpenter’s latest album borrows from Shania Twain and Grande in parts; and Charli has mentioned electronic pioneers like Sophie and titans like Lou Reed and Daft Punk in “Brat” press — it’s their approach to the genre whose rules and boundaries are well-known that make them such exciting artists.  The artists make few compromises in their music. Charli’s beats are tailor-made for the club, with lyrics vacillating between braggadocious bombast to reflections on grief and insecurity. (“Nowadays I only eat at the good restaurants, but honestly I’m always thinkin’ ‘bout my weight,” she sings in “Rewind.”)  Roan’s campy, drag-inspired musical aesthetic has drawn more than a few comparisons to Lady Gaga’s similarly theatrical sound. It lends itself well to songs about hooking up with and falling hard for other women — still a rarity in mainstream pop. (“She did it right there, out on the deck — put her canine teeth in the side of my neck,” goes the first verse of “Red Wine Supernova.”)  Carpenter stuffs a dozen double entendres and innuendos into each deliriously raunchy song on “Short n’ Sweet.” And then sometimes, she drops the artifice and just says what she means: “I’m so f**king horny!” Here’s a pop star plainly confessing and celebrating her lust, something artists like Madonna were once lambasted for. Flirting with cheeky controversy, as with Madonna, has only boosted her profile.  Sabrina Carpenter, pictured at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, has won fans over with her retro pop sensibility and raunchy lyrics. Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty Images  Their music isn’t necessarily political, though Charli, who’s British, famously waded into the conversation when she posted, “kamala IS brat” shortly after the vice president’s candidacy in the US presidential election was announced. But the candid, confident music these pop stars make is meaningful during this turbulent moment, Errico said.  Songs like Charli’s “I think about it all the time,” in which the avowed party girl weighs motherhood, Roan’s various queer love songs and even Carpenter’s lusty, lightweight “Juno,” take on a new gravity at a time when, in the US, bodily autonomy for women and LGBTQ people is fraught and uncertain, Errico said.  “I think they’re sensing the clock turning back, and coming up with hooky, clever ways to say, ‘Over my dead body,’” Errico said. “They’re building a new army for a newly perilous time, while also having a blast.”  The future of pop, Murphy says, is tipping toward honest excess. We saw it this year with Charli transforming massive arenas into sweaty clubs, Roan painting herself with the patina of the Statue of Liberty, Carpenter enraging pearl-clutchers by striking provocative poses on tour. None of the over-the-top flourishes would work, though, without confessional bangers that both transport and ring true.  “People sometimes joke that we’re living in ‘the worst timeline,’ but these artists are determined to throw the best party anyone’s ever tried to shut down,” Errico said."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/federal-government-workers-what-matters/index.html,CNN,left,International,How many people work for the federal government?,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.  CNN —  The US grew a lot in the past 40 years.  The US population expanded by about 100 million people  One of them was Vivek Ramaswamy, who was born in 1985 and is one of two wealthy men tasked by President-elect Donald Trump with shrinking the size of the federal government.  Government spending skyrocketed  The US spent around $900 billion in 1984 ($2.7 trillion in 2024 dollars), compared with more than $7 trillion in 2024. Some of that money goes via contracts to Elon Musk, the world’s richest man who is working with Ramaswamy on the Department of Government Efficiency, a new nongovernmental commission.  The national debt has more than exploded  It went from less than $1.6 trillion in 1984 ($4.8 trillion in 2024 dollars) to more than $35.5 trillion today, which should concern every American and is plenty of reason to make any effort to control federal spending a serious and bipartisan push.  Cut federal workers?  The current effort, run by Ramaswamy and Musk, has made a show of eyeing the size of the federal workforce. One percolating idea, according to CNN’s reporting, is that they could recommend firing every federal worker hired in the last year.  Hold on a sec  In those 40 years of explosive population, spending and debt growth, the size of the federal workforce – this is actually kind of shocking – has stayed pretty much the same, confounding the popular presumption that the number of federal workers must have skyrocketed with federal spending.  “The number of federal employees have skyrocketed over the past four years, especially the number that are working from home and not even coming to work,” the House Oversight Committee chairman, Rep. James Comer, told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Thursday, expressing that view.  A closer look at available data shows a variation of a few hundred thousand workers – which seems large but is not a grand expansion of the federal workforce.  Close to 3 million federal civilian workers for decades  There were about 2.96 million civilians, including postal workers, getting full-time paychecks from the federal government at the end of 1984, before Ramaswamy was born, and there are a hair over 3 million working for the federal government today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The official tally from the Office of Personnel Management is a smidge lower, at about 2.87 million, including postal workers.  In fact, the number of full-time federal workers has been relatively static, within a few hundred thousand civilians, since the 1960s.  Even a drawdown of the size of the military and Pentagon during the George H.W. Bush administration and of the federal workforce by hundreds of thousands during the Clinton administration did not markedly change the size of the federal workforce, which has hovered within a few hundred thousand of 3 million workers for decades.  Hundreds of thousands in, hundreds of thousands out every year  Of people who come into and go out of the federal workforce each year, there were hundreds of thousands of civilian employees (not counting postal workers) – about 250,000 to just over 300,000 – newly hired by the federal government in each of the past three years. Those are largely offset by the hundreds of thousands of civilian employees who leave the civil service each year.  Peter Morrissey is the senior director of talent and strategy at The Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for improvements to public service and commissioned a 2017 study to determine the true size of government.  “When you think about the long sweep of it, the number of public servants – people with a .gov email who work for the federal government – has been basically static as the responsibility sets have grown and grown and grown and grown and grown,” he told me. “They serve more people, and they do more stuff.”  Rising costs of social programs like Social Security and Medicare, along with rising costs of material goods, have helped drive government spending.  “People are an absolutely essential part, but in terms of the cost structure, are a comparatively small part,” he said.  In some agencies that Republicans have said they want to shutter, there are relatively few employees – such as the smallest Cabinet-level agency, the Department of Education. It employs about 4,400 employees, according to OPM. The largest federal agencies, like Veterans Affairs and the Pentagon, employ hundreds of thousands of workers.  Most federal workers are not in the DC area  Another thing to know about the federal workforce is that while its largest concentration is in the Washington, DC, metro area, the vast majority, 80%, is spread around the country in every state, but with concentrations in California, Texas, Colorado, Alabama and other states.  Concentrating on improving government might not mean shrinking it, according to Jenny Mattingley, vice president of government affairs at the Partnership for Public Service, which advocates for smarter government.  “What we keep trying to pivot the conversation to is say, let’s make sure we’re fixing government in a way that doesn’t hurt service delivery and doesn’t hurt the American public in terms of getting the things from agencies that they depend on,” she said.  ‘Giant holding company’  The government does indeed do many things. Elaine Kamarck is founding director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, and she helped spearhead an effort to reduce the size of government during the Clinton administration.  She told me it’s important not to view the US government as one monolithic thing, but rather as “essentially a giant holding company.”  “It’s doing everything from training pilots to fly advanced aircraft to tracking down cryptosporidium in your hamburger meat to cutting checks for retired people,” she said.  Firing only the most recent hires, as may be suggested by Musk and Ramaswamy, would have the added impact of scaring away future hires, as well as displacing people hired for specific roles, such as to implement the bipartisan infrastructure law passed during the Biden administration.  Once funded, agencies never go away  But Comer said people hired for specific roles and programs funded once have a tendency to stick around.  “The problem now in government, it’s been the problem for decades … is that you create a government program or create a government agency, it never goes away, even when it becomes obsolete or inefficient,” Comer told Brown on CNN.  The real deep state  On the one hand, the use of contractors and grant employees has risen as those workers, who don’t get a paycheck directly from the government but still do government work, have shouldered more of the burden.  John DiIulio, who worked in both the Barack Obama and George W. Bush administrations, wrote recently that the intersecting system of companies and local officials clamoring for federal dollars represents their own form of a deep state, and deconstructing it will be, he wrote, way harder than rocket science. Here’s an excerpt of what DiIulio wrote:  The citizens of the real deep state stoke nonstop federal deficit spending on everything from Medicare to missiles. They steer funding through intentionally maze-like federal programs. They use federal tax dollars to privately employ millions of people. They are behind the ‘waste, fraud, and abuse’ that everyone typically blames on ‘bureaucrats’ who are mostly mere grant and contract managers in a workforce that has not grown since the 1960s.  Musk, who has built companies on government contracts and subsidies, may be able to offer some insight into how the system works.  How many people actually work for the government, including contractors?  That review of “The True Size of Government” conducted for The Volcker Alliance by researcher Paul Light determined that in 1984, there were more than 6.9 million people working as civilians for the federal government when including contractors and grant employees. Add in the military and postal workers and the figure jumped to 9.8 million.  Intervening years saw a drawdown in the military after the Cold War and then a buildup during the Global War on terror. The study concluded with data from 2015, when there was a total of 9.1 million workers, or 7.3 million without the military or postal service.  Certainly the figure of contract and grant employees must have grown along with major spending bills in the past few years – with the infrastructure bill, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, which earmarked billions to transition the US to a greener economy. Comer said Musk and Ramaswamy, who will take a year and a half to make recommendations, could recommend trying to claw back unspent funds.  “There has been some pressure over years to not increase head count, and that usually leads to greater contracting,” Morrissey said, although there’s evidence that contractors frequently end up costing the government more money.  Everyone I talked to for this story agrees there is plenty of room for bipartisanship in a government efficiency effort to modernize the workforce and improve the way the federal government functions. Both Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Musk have talked about the need to control Pentagon spending, for instance. One complication for Musk will be that his firm SpaceX, in particular, is the recipient of billions in contracts."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,International,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process that would have the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items that may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/health/unitedhealth-children-autism-propublica/index.html,CNN,left,International,UnitedHealth is strategically limiting access to critical treatment for kids with autism,"This story was originally published by ProPublica.  ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive its biggest stories as soon as they’re published.  There was a time when Sharelle Menard thought her son would never be able to speak. She couldn’t soothe Benji when he cried, couldn’t read him books he could follow, couldn’t take him out in public. “The screaming, and screaming, and screaming,” she said. “He would get so frustrated because he couldn’t communicate.”  Benji was nearly 3 when he was diagnosed with severe autism and soon after started a specialized therapy to help him develop basic skills. After two years in treatment, his murmuring gave way to small words, with “bubbles” among the first. To celebrate, Menard powered up a bubble machine she found at the dollar store, and for hours, they watched the iridescent orbs drift over their porch.  Menard, who is raising Benji alone in south-central Louisiana, began to picture a future for her son that diverged from the stories she’d heard about some kids with similar diagnoses, who grew up still unable to manage their frustrations and had to live in nursing homes or institutions.  But now, she’s worried again.  The insurer that has been paying for her son’s therapy, UnitedHealthcare, has begun — to the befuddlement of his clinical team — denying him the hours they say he requires to maintain his progress. Inside the insurance conglomerate, the nation’s largest and most profitable, the slashing of care to children like Benji does have a reason, though it has little to do with their needs. It is part of a secret internal cost-cutting campaign that targets a growing financial burden for the company: the treatment of thousands of children with autism across the country.  ProPublica has obtained what is effectively the company’s strategic playbook, developed by Optum, the division that manages mental health benefits for United. In internal reports, the company acknowledges that the therapy, called applied behavior analysis, is the “evidence-based gold standard treatment for those with medically necessary needs.” But the company’s costs have climbed as the number of children diagnosed with autism has ballooned; experts say greater awareness and improved screening have contributed to a fourfold increase in the past two decades — from 1 in 150 to 1 in 36.  So Optum is “pursuing market-specific action plans” to limit children’s access to the treatment, the reports said.  “Key opportunities” are outlined in bullets in the documents. While acknowledging some areas have “very long waitlists” for the therapy, the company said it aims to “prevent new providers from joining the network” and “terminate” existing ones, including “cost outliers.” If an insurer drops a provider from its network, patients may have to find a new clinician that accepts their insurance or pay up to tens of thousands of dollars a year out of pocket for the therapy. The company has calculated that, in some states, this reduction could impact more than two-fifths of its ABA therapy provider groups in network and up to 19% of its patients in therapy.  Internal company documents reveal the strategy by Optum, a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary, to prevent ABA providers from participating in its network. Obtained by ProPublica  The strategy targets kids covered through the company’s state-contracted Medicaid plans, funded by the government for the nation’s poorest and most vulnerable patients. To manage Medicaid benefits, states often pay private insurers a fixed amount of funds per patient, regardless of the frequency or intensity of services used. When companies spend less than the allotted payment, they are typically allowed to keep some or all of what remains, which federal investigators and experts acknowledge may be incentivizing insurers to limit care.  United administers Medicaid plans or benefits in about two dozen states and for more than 6 million people, including nearly 10,000 children with autism spectrum disorder. Optum expects to spend about $290 million for ABA therapy within its Medicaid plans this year, and it anticipates the need increasing, documents show. The number of its Medicaid patients accessing the specialized therapy has increased by about 20% over the past year, with expenses rising about $75 million year-on-year.  So Optum — whose parent company, UnitedHealth Group, earned $22 billion in net profits last year — is “heavily investing” in its plan to save millions by limiting access to such care.  In addition to culling providers from its network, the company is scrutinizing the medical necessity of the therapy for individual patients with “rigorous” clinical reviews, which can lead to denials of covered treatment. Optum has developed an “approach to authorizing less units than requested,” the records state.  Internal company documents reveal Optum is deploying “rigorous utilization management” in response to an increased need for ABA therapy. Obtained by ProPublica  Mental health and autism experts and advocates reviewed ProPublica’s findings and expressed outrage over the company’s strategy. Karen Fessel, whose Mental Health and Autism Insurance Project helps families access care, called the tactics “unconscionable and immoral.”  “They’re denying access to treatment and shrinking a network at a time when they clearly know that there is an urgent need,” she said.  United and Optum declined a request ProPublica made more than a month ago for an on-the-record interview about their coverage of behavioral health care. They have not answered questions emailed 11 days ago, citing the Dec. 4 killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO as the reason. In an email, a spokesperson said “we are in mourning” and could not engage with a “non-urgent story during this incredibly difficult moment in time.” Offered an additional day or two, the company would not agree to a deadline for comment.  Benji, who is now 10, requires 33 hours of weekly therapy to be able to progress, his therapists have concluded. They have documented the consequences of having even a few hours less: toppled furniture, scratched-up classroom aides, a kid in unremitting tears, unable to learn. But in a letter to Menard, Optum said it was refusing to pay for the full hours, stating that her son had been in therapy for too long and was not showing enough progress to ultimately graduate from it.  “Your child still has a lot of difficulty with all autism-related needs,” Optum wrote. “Your child still needs help, but it does not appear that your child will improve enough to end ABA.”  The response confounded experts who spoke with ProPublica, who said such an approach misunderstands the long-term nature of his condition. “Challenges that often come with autism shouldn’t be looked at like an injury that you’re going to get better from quickly and then the treatment can stop,” said Christa Stevens, who directs state government affairs for the advocacy group Autism Speaks. “Treatment may still be medically necessary even if it’s for skill maintenance or the prevention of regression.”  The company’s denial also appears to contrast with recent professional guidelines for the therapy — which are cited as a reference in Optum’s own clinical criteria — that state “there is no specific limit on the duration of a course of treatment.”  The appropriate duration of treatment, according to those standards and experts interviewed by ProPublica, should be based on the patients’ needs, as evaluated by the clinicians working directly with the patients.  “This is a very blunt instrument to chase after excessive costs,” said Tim Clement, the vice president of federal government affairs at the nonprofit group Mental Health America.  Several advocates told ProPublica the company’s strategy is legally questionable.  The federal mental health parity law requires insurers to provide the same access to mental health and physical care. As ProPublica recently reported, United has gotten in trouble in the past for targeting therapy coverage in a way that violates the law; while denying the allegations, it agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement. It continues to use arbitrary and one-size-fits-all thresholds to scrutinize its therapy claims, ProPublica previously found.  It would raise legal questions if the company restricted ABA more stringently than comparable physical care, the advocates said.  “Medicaid managed care organizations are subject to the parity act,” said Deborah Steinberg, a senior health policy attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Legal Action Center. The company may be violating Medicaid regulations, she said, which require managed care organizations to maintain networks sufficient to provide covered services to all enrollees.  Last year, the federal government formally affirmed that ABA therapy is a protected benefit, and it recently investigated health plans for entirely excluding its coverage; legislators have passed laws in every state requiring insurance companies to pay for it.  “Yes, this therapy can be expensive,” said Dan Unumb, an attorney and president of the Autism Legal Resource Center. “But solving the problem by denying kids access to medically necessary care is a terrible solution.”  ‘What happens if we withdraw the care?’  Benji dances with his behavior analyst, Whitney Newton, at Aspire Behavioral Health Center in Lafayette. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  Benji was making progress about three years ago.  For more than 33 hours a week in the specialized therapy, his clinicians broke down the learning process into basic steps, using repetition and positive reinforcement to affirm behaviors. The state’s Medicaid contractor, UnitedHealthcare, covered the bill.  Researchers have found that about a quarter of kids diagnosed with autism are severely affected; these children are often minimally or non-speaking or require extensive assistance for basic daily needs. “Things a lot of people take for granted,” said Menard. While experts continue to debate which therapies are most effective and appropriate for these kids, ABA is one of the most widely recommended.  By 7, Benji had accumulated a few dozen words, and his aggressive, prolonged tantrums had grown less frequent, allowing his mother to take him grocery shopping and to mass on Sundays. It was time for him to go to school, she thought.  Menard enrolled him in their public school district, St. Martin Parish. He attended Breaux Bridge Primary twice a week in a special education classroom and continued therapy the other days. Menard urged the district to allow a therapeutic technician to shadow him in school, but it refused. (The district declined to respond to ProPublica’s questions, citing privacy restrictions.)  With the diminished hours of treatment, Benji grew increasingly disruptive. “It was a disaster,” said Menard. He snapped a swing in gym class and struggled to sit still during lessons. When teachers tried to give him instructions, he hit them. His speech plateaued and eventually regressed.  Menard, who cleans pools for a living, grew to fear the moment her phone rang. School employees, unable to soothe Benji’s tantrums, frequently called her to take him home. One morning last spring, they told her Benji had lashed out when an aide tried to persuade him to work, aggressively poking their hand with a pencil. He hadn’t broken the skin, but after a dozen incidents, the situation was becoming unsalvageable. The district made her sign a behavioral contract, his second in two years: If Benji didn’t behave, he could be suspended or expelled.  Menard felt she had no choice but to withdraw Benji. She enrolled him full time in a home-study program run by his therapy group, Aspire Behavioral Health Center in Lafayette, which costs about $10,000 a year in tuition, a substantial portion of her paycheck. That was in addition to the therapy cost, which his insurance still covered.  Benji’s clinicians determined he needed direct support for most of the day and told Optum they wanted him to scale up his therapy from 24 hours a week to 33. They expected the insurer would approve the request; after all, it was less than what was previously covered and only nine hours more than it was currently paying for.  But Optum denied the increase in a letter to Menard this past May. “Your child has been in ABA for six years,” the insurer wrote. “After six years, more progress would be expected.”  The response disturbed Whitney Newton, Benji’s behavior analyst and a clinical director at Aspire; it didn’t seem rooted in the established medical standards for the treatment. She’d seen firsthand how critical the therapy had been to his growth. “We know what he needs. It’s in our scope of practice and it’s our right as the provider to determine that,” she said. “They’re cutting and denying an unethical amount.”  The center’s founder, psychologist Joslyn McCoy, has grown accustomed to battling insurers. Her practice serves about 160 patients between the ages of 2 and 19 across five centers, and many have Medicaid coverage. In 2022, Louisiana expanded its Medicaid parameters, allowing parents with higher incomes to access coverage for children with complex medical needs.  “What I’m seeing is that children now have this ticket to access this care, but then once they go to try to access it, it’s being denied,” she said.  Nearly two years ago, Optum selected her center for a payment integrity audit, demanding to inspect its clinical and billing records. After her team turned over thousands of pages of documentation, Optum conducted a separate in-person quality review.  Internal company records show Optum is targeting ABA providers for scrutiny based on how much they invoice and how many services they provide. Groups like McCoy’s can be flagged for patterns that providers told ProPublica are typical in the delivery of ABA therapy: billing on weekends or holidays, serving multiple family members in one practice, having long clinician or patient days, providing an “above average delivery” of services, or abruptly increasing or decreasing the number of patients or claims.  Internal company documents reveal Optum’s strategy for identifying ABA providers for scrutiny based on “outlier patterns.” Obtained by ProPublica  McCoy said that a company executive who visited her office for the quality review told her that she approved of the center’s work and thought Aspire should expand across the state.  But Optum has continued to challenge her patients’ individual therapy claims.  When her team received the denial for Benji’s care, McCoy set out to gather hard evidence to demonstrate the necessity of his treatment. “It’s what we call a reversal to baseline, where we will withdraw the treatment for a short period of time,” McCoy said. “The reason is to demonstrate what happens because we’re curious, too: What happens if we withdraw the care?”  Much of the therapy is driven by positive reinforcement; for example, if Benji pays attention and engages in his academic exercises, he can take a break to play on his iPad. But the reward is contingent on him not hitting anyone for at least 10 minutes at a time. During the experiment, the clinicians took away the possibility of his reward, and without an incentive, they had limited leverage to manage his behavior.  Joslyn McCoy, founder and director of Aspire Behavioral Health Center. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  At first, Benji lightly hit the staff, they said, as though testing the limits. But when there was no response to his behavior, it began to escalate. He tossed chairs and flipped tables. He pushed Newton into a bookshelf, which collapsed to the ground. He hit walls and windows, eventually turning his fists on his aide. They stopped the experiment early, both for his safety and theirs.  Once they resumed the interventions, Benji was able to calm down.  Newton drafted a report, including line charts that quantified his behavior with and without the interventions and photographs of her team’s injuries. She faxed it to Optum, asking the company to reconsider the denial.  The insurer did not change its decision.  ‘The need is not going away’  Last month, inside a cubicle decorated with posters of Minions and Mario Brothers, a behavior technician placed a laminated card with an image of a sneaker in front of Benji.  “What is this?” she asked him.  Benji paused, rubbing the edge of his baseball cap and pursing his lips. “Sh,” he said, stuck on the consonant.  “Shoes, that’s right,” the technician responded. She pulled out another card, showing a slice topped with white frosting. “Is this cake?”  “No,” Benji said.  “Is this cake?” she repeated, before adding, “yes.”  “Yes,” echoed Benji, but her correction appeared to frustrate him. He hit the technician on the leg, softly but with determination.  “We’ll let it go,” she warned with a sugared voice, “but hands to self, OK?”  Benji works with registered behavioral technician Hortencia Cervantez during ABA treatment. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  After 10 minutes, a timer beeped. It was time for Benji’s reward, getting to hear a reggaeton hit by Daddy Yankee. “It’s a big reinforcer here,” Newton said.  Even though Optum denied the additional hours of treatment, Benji has continued to receive them. “We’re giving the hours even if they were not approved,” McCoy said. “We don’t think it would be safe for him to do what the insurance is saying.”  Next month, a state administrative law judge will hear an appeal for the additional hours. If the request is approved, Benji’s clinicians will be paid for the six months of services that they’ve provided without reimbursement.  Even if that happens, their battle with the insurer will go back to square one. Each insurance authorization typically lasts for only six months, and soon after the hearing date, the clinicians will have to request coverage for his treatment again.  They will be doing so at a time when internal records show Optum has deployed more than 90 “care advocates” to question clinicians about the medical necessity of their patients’ ABA treatment, using “quality initiatives to decrease overutilization and cost.”  Optum is focusing on states whose Medicaid plans yield the highest costs for ABA therapy, including Arizona, Nebraska, Tennessee, Virginia, New Jersey, Indiana and Louisiana, where Menard and her son live. ProPublica reached out to the state Medicaid programs with questions about their oversight of United’s practices. Arizona’s Medicaid agency told ProPublica that all managed care organizations, including United, are required to provide timely services within their networks, and that the agency has been closely monitoring ABA networks. (Read its full response.) No other state Medicaid agencies responded to ProPublica’s questions.  Internal company documents reveal Optum’s strategy for managing its ABA coverage. Obtained by ProPublica  Autism experts said such a strategy may not only be harmful to children, it could also ultimately be more expensive for states, as children age and require more intensive services, like residential or nursing care.  “If these kids get the intervention they need as children, then there will be tremendous cost savings over the course of their lives,” said Lorri Unumb, an attorney and CEO of the Council of Autism Service Providers.  Menard worries about what will happen to her son’s hard-fought gains if he can’t get the level of therapy he needs. And even if the additional nine hours are approved, she fears that with the next authorization, they could face a more drastic denial that could be challenging to overturn.

She just hopes the therapy helps him to be better able to advocate for himself and, ultimately, be safe. “There’s nothing else that I’ve known to work,” she said.  McCoy resents being put in the position of scaling back care that her patient needs because an insurer is refusing to pay. “It puts us in a tough place, because we don’t want to discontinue therapy of our client who’s not ready,” she said.  When such denials become common, it disincentivizes clinicians from working with insurance companies, she said, and can ultimately drive clinics into the ground. “The patients can’t afford it,” she said, “so eventually the private provider goes out of business.”  But even if children like Benji get pushed out of treatment, there is no shortage of children seeking care. McCoy’s center currently has a waitlist of about 260 children.  That list may likely expand. Internal documents show Optum is aiming to exclude from its network about 40% of Louisiana groups that offer ABA therapy. About 1 in 5 children whose treatment is covered by the company’s Medicaid plan in the state could lose access to care.  “If the insurance company wants to deny all of our clients, we’re going to replace them,” she said. “The need is not going away.”"

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  Flybys of Jupiter’s fiery moon Io, carried out by NASA’s Juno spacecraft, are helping to solve the enduring mystery of why the small moon is the most volcanically active body in our solar system.  Similar in size to Earth’s moon, Io has an estimated 400 volcanoes that continuously release plumes and lava that coat that moon’s surface.  The Juno mission, which has been orbiting and observing Jupiter and its moons since July 2016, made incredibly close flybys of Io in December 2023 and February. The spacecraft zipped within 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) of the moon’s surface, capturing images and data. Together, Juno’s flybys have enabled an unprecedented look at the smoldering moon, including taking observations of its poles for the first time.  Researchers presented some of the results from an analysis of the flyby data Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in Washington, DC. A paper detailing some of the findings was also published Thursday in the journal Nature.  “Io is one of the most intriguing objects in the whole solar system,” said study coauthor Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator and an associate vice president at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “We can see that this body is completely covered with volcanoes over both poles and all across its middle, (which are) constantly going off.”  Volcanoes on the surface of Io erupt continuously, as depicted in this animation. NASA  The new data suggests that Io’s numerous volcanoes are each likely powered by their own chamber of hot magma, rather than being fed by a global ocean of magma beneath the surface. The latter had long been a prevailing hypothesis by astronomers.  The finding could change the way astronomers understand moons dominated by subsurface global oceans in our solar system, such as Jupiter’s moon Europa and planets beyond our solar system.  Spotting a cosmic pizza  Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, known as the father of modern astronomy, discovered Io on January 8, 1610.  But the moon’s wild volcanic activity wasn’t detected until Voyager 1 flew by Jupiter and its moons in 1979, revealing Io’s dynamic surface that resembled a pepperoni pizza, Bolton said.  NASA's Juno spacecraft captures the north polar region of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io on December 30, 2023. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS  That year, Linda Morabito, an imaging scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, became the first person to identify a volcanic plume as she studied an image of Io captured by Voyager 1.  The revelation sparked a decades-long mystery as astronomers wondered about the origins of Io’s constant volcanic activity.  “Since Morabito’s discovery, planetary scientists have wondered how the volcanoes were fed from the lava underneath the surface,” Bolton said. “Was there a shallow ocean of white-hot magma fueling the volcanoes, or was their source more localized? We knew data from Juno’s two very close flybys could give us some insights on how this tortured moon actually worked.”  This sequence of images taken by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2007 shows a giant plume from Io's Tvashtar volcano. NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute  Flyby revelations  Io orbits around Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, which Bolton calls a “monster.” The moon’s orbit is imperfect, meaning that sometimes it comes closer to Jupiter during its orbit, and other times it is farther away. Io completes one orbit around the planet every 42.5 hours.  Jupiter’s massive gravitational influence squeezes Io as it orbits the planet, like a hand squeezing a rubber ball, which warms up the moon. This phenomenon is called tidal flexing, or friction from tidal forces that generate internal heat.  “That’s what’s happening inside Io,” Bolton said. “That squeezing is generating heat, and it’s getting so hot that (Io’s) insides are literally melting and popping out. The eruptions are constant. It’s like a nonstop rainstorm. It’s just always erupting all over the place.”  Io is tiny in comparison with Jupiter, as seen in this animation, and the giant planet's gravitational forces cause the inhospitable conditions on the fiery moon. CNN/NASA  The constant flexing of Jupiter’s tug on Io generates immense energy, which would melt part of the moon’s interior, Bolton said. And if the melting was substantial enough, it would create a global magma ocean that Juno could use its instruments to detect.  During its close flybys, Juno captured high-precision Doppler data, which measured Io’s gravity by tracking how zipping closely to the moon affected the spacecraft’s acceleration. The data was compared with observations from previous missions that have flown by Jupiter and its moons, such as NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, as well as ground-based telescopes.  Together, the observations point to a rigid, mostly solid interior beneath Io’s surface, rather than a global magma ocean — solving a 45-year mystery started by Voyager 1’s observations. Instead, the volcanoes are powered by more local sources, and each one has its own pocket of magma beneath it.  “Juno’s discovery that tidal forces do not always create global magma oceans does more than prompt us to rethink what we know about Io’s interior,” said lead study author Ryan Park, a Juno co-investigator and supervisor of the Solar System Dynamics Group at JPL, in a statement. “It has implications for our understanding of other moons, such as (Saturn’s) Enceladus and Europa, and even exoplanets and super-Earths. Our new findings provide an opportunity to rethink what we know about planetary formation and evolution.”  The mission has also helped to capture an array of imagery that showcases Io’s “primordial fantasy land surface,” said Heidi Becker, a planetary scientist at JPL who was not involved in the study. The images are bringing different features on Io into focus like never before, including islands spotted on massive lava lakes, such as one called Loki Patera, which is so large that astronomers compare it more to a lava sea sitting on Io’s surface.  This animation shows the harsh features created by lava on the surface of Io. CNN/JPL  The Juno spacecraft continues to contribute new insights about Jupiter and its moons, having recently completed a flyby over Jupiter’s swirling cloud tops on November 24. Next, Juno will swing by 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers) above Jupiter’s center on December 27, logging 645.7 million miles (1.04 billion kilometers) since beginning its investigation of Jupiter eight years ago."
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/from-true-crimes-to-terror-when-is-dark-tourism-too-dark/index.html,CNN,left,International,From true crimes to terror: When is ‘dark tourism’ too dark?,"CNN —  Fifty years ago, parishioners from Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple in San Francisco began to settle a rural commune in the South American country of Guyana. The Jonestown experiment ended four years later in one of the most tragic and bizarre murder-suicide incidents in American history. More than 900 people died on November 18, 1978, including a US congressman named Leo Ryan.  Now that Guyana is considering a proposal by a government-backed tour operator to open the now-overgrown compound to visitors, it raises a fascinating debate about the appeal, ethics and sensitivities of so-called “dark tourism” — the visiting of sites associated with tragedy.  Why are the locations of past atrocities, natural disasters, infamous deaths and incarcerations so popular with visitors? What does it say about us that we want to get close to these vortexes of disaster and evil? What obligations do governments have to give or deny access? Who gets to decide how history is presented to visitors? And what impact do such events and the subsequent visitors have on those who live near these spots?  There are no simple answers, but it’s important to explore the questions anyway.  Is it not simply history?  The welcome sign at the entrance of Jonestown, Guyana in 2022.

Design Pics Inc/Shutterstock dark tourism Prev Next  On my first cross-country trip, in college, my girlfriend and I stopped at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, the site of a battle in which nearly 200 died, including a former US congressman named Davy Crockett. Then a week later in Los Angeles, local relatives of mine took us on a driving tour that included the crime scene address of then-recently murdered Nicole Brown Simpson. The former visit felt like a US history lesson, the latter like morbid gawking. And somewhere in between is the subjective line that dark tourism dances around.  Dark tourism (also known as memorial tourism, or thanatourism, from the Greek “Thanatos” meaning death, or more derogatorily as morbid tourism, or grief tourism) comes in various shades.  Gettysburg was the single deadliest battle in the US Civil War, where 51,000 souls took their last breath, and yet where countless school field trips and, according to the National Park Service, 1.5 million visitors flock every year. Is that dark tourism? How about visiting the beaches in France where between 8,000 and 14,000 soldiers died in the D-Day invasions that turned the tide for Allies winning World War II? And what of Ground Zero and Flight 93 memorials for more than 3,000 who died on September 11, 2001?  I have toured Cambodia’s Killing Fields, with a survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide that left between 1.5 and 3 million murdered (in the four years following the Jonestown tragedy). Isn’t it important to visit atrocities such as that one, and former Nazi concentration camps?  The point of visiting these places is to feel uncomfortable, to bear witness, to share what you’ve seen and how it made you feel. Travel changes us, and sometimes because of exposure to the worst of human nature.  You’ve heard of the Disneyfication of places. Dark tourism is the opposite of that. These are the unhappiest places on earth. Yet they are places you should never forget. To go there honors the dead, their memory, their pain.  How far is too far?  There are examples when the line seems less clear, where bearing witness to past events feels more like slowing down to see the aftermath of a fatal car accident.  The first time I visited Savannah, Georgia I took a “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” tour. This was not long after the best-selling book of that name became a Hollywood film chronicling a real double murder that took place less than 10 years earlier. On the tour I kept thinking, “The people who live next door to these places may actually remember the victims, may have even been friends with them.”  People outside the Beverly Hills, California mansion where brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents in 1989 David Swanson/AFP/Getty Images  Just last month we reported on how the Los Angeles mansion where Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents has become the latest “dark tourism” hot spot. The brothers are back in the news and the subject of a recent documentary, but it’s hard to imagine what visitors are learning by simply staring at a crime scene. It reminded me of my Simpson murder scene visit, or the time I tried to find LA’s Cielo Drive, the site of the 1969 murders by the Manson “family.”  But how many degrees are those stops from touring Ford’s Theatre in Washington DC where a president was shot, or the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas from which another was? Is it ok to see thousands of Mount Vesuvius’ victims in Pompei, Italy because they were killed 2,000 years ago? How about going on an entertaining tour of Jack the Ripper’s victims in London from the late 1800s? Or paying a lot of money to go deep underwater for a view of the Titanic – where visitors themselves died last year while exploring a shipwreck where about 1,500 died just over 100 years ago? Does time desensitize us to these crimes and tragedies?  What is your intention?  In the early 2000s, while visiting friends living in Gloucester, Massachusetts, I felt an undertow pulling me toward the Crow’s Nest, the local bar made famous in a book by Sebastian Junger and the subsequent film of the same name, “The Perfect Storm.” They document the 1991 storm and final days of six fishermen from the small, tight knit community who frequented the Crow’s Nest.  On one visit I was walking along Gloucester’s small harbor when I saw a new ice cream shop had opened called The Perfect Scoop. I thought it rather distasteful, a description I’ve never before nor since used to describe ice cream, and it left me feeling embarrassed for having wanted to visit the Crow’s Nest. I decided to leave the salty bar to the locals.  The bookcase to the secret annex in the renovated Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Frank died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945 at the age of 15. Koen Van Weel/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock  But I’ve enjoyed the murder-heavy night tour of San Francisco’s Alcatraz prison island; walked through the “Bloody Sunday” neighborhood of Derry, Northern Ireland; visited Anne Frank’s home in Amsterdam and was equally moved by The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, inside the old Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. This summer I’m planning a family trip to Japan and added Hiroshima to the itinerary because I feel it’s important for my daughters to make a connection to the violence our country unleashed on another country, killing at least 66,000 in that city alone.  And I’ve long wanted to visit Jonestown. When I lived in San Francisco, just before seeing a show at the famous Fillmore auditorium, I popped around the corner to see the location of Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple, the last stop before Guyana. I feel drawn to follow that nightmare of a story into the real world, where it has been sitting in situ since the mass deaths. I want to talk to those who live nearby, understand the events more clearly, bear witness, go into the heart of darkness.  Perhaps the salient question to ask oneself before planning such a trip is: What is the intention? Is it to learn and understand? Or is it merely to scratch the itch of a morbid curiosity? Think about the locals, of the friends and family who are connected to the tragedy and ask whether visiting honors a legacy or exploits a tragedy. In the end, you may be the only one who can judge the ethics of visiting these places."

Nancy Pelosi underwent a “successful” hip replacement surgery Saturday and is “well on the mend,” according to a spokesperson, one day after being hospitalized from an injury sustained during an official engagement in Luxembourg.  Pelosi was admitted to a hospital in Luxembourg as the result of a fall on the stairs, three sources told CNN. Pelosi’s office declined to comm﻿ent on how the California congresswoman was injured.  Pelosi, 84, is receiving “excellent care” from doctors and medical professionals, Ian Krager, the spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday.  The US military had medevaced the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. The medical center is a major military hospital that for years has treated US troops injured in combat.  “While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,” Krager said Friday.  Pelosi is “currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals. She continues to work and regrets that she is unable to attend the remainder of the CODEL engagements to honor the courage of our servicemembers during one of the greatest acts of American heroism in our nation’s history,” Krager said, adding that Pelosi “looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.”  The injury sustained by Pelosi came just days after longtime Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell tripped and fell at the US Capitol, spraining his wrist and cutting his face.  McConnell sustained a “minor cut to the face” and was “cleared to resume his schedule,” a spokesperson for the 82-year-old Kentucky Republican said in a statement Tuesday.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/entertainment/jay-z-lawsuit-response/index.html,CNN,left,International,Jay-Z says inconsistencies in rape accuser’s story proves her attorney was looking for ‘money and fame’,"CNN —  Jay-Z is doubling down on his denial that he ever raped a teenage girl alongside Sean “Diddy” Combs, saying that newly revealed inconsistencies in her story prove that her account is not credible.  Earlier this week, an anonymous Jane Doe filed an amended complaint against Combs and Jay-Z, whose given name is Shawn Carter, which revealed that a previously unnamed celebrity in her original complaint against Combs, initially filed in October, was Carter. In the amended complaint, Carter is accused of raping the then-13-year-old Jane Doe at an afterparty for the MTV Video Music Awards in the year 2000.  The amended complaint made Carter the first celebrity to be accused of sexual assault in connection to Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to three federal charges and is awaiting a criminal trial.  In a new interview on Friday, the Jane Doe said she is standing by her rape accusation against Carter, but admits to inconsistencies in her original story, including key corroborating witnesses.  “I have made some mistakes,” the Jane Doe told NBC News. “You should always advocate for yourself and be a voice for yourself. You should never let what somebody else did ruin or run your life. I just hope I can give others the strength to come forward like I came forward.”  In her initial complaint, Jane Doe said that she asked her father to pick her up in 2000 after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Carter and Combs. But her father now said that he does not recall picking her up, according to NBC News, which also reported that Jane Doe said that she spoke to a celebrity the night she alleged she was raped, but that celebrity said they were not in New York at the time her allegations took place.  Jane Doe’s attorney, Tony Buzbee, said that he is still vetting his client’s claims, but is standing by her accusations.  “Our client remains fiercely adamant that what she has stated is true, to the best of her memory. We will continue to vet her claims and collect corroborating data to the extent it exists. Because we have interrogated her intensely, she has even agreed to submit to a polygraph. I’ve never had a client suggest that before,” Buzbee told CNN via email on Friday evening. “In any event, we always do our best to vet each claim made, just as we did in this case. This has been extremely distressing for her, to the point she has experienced seizures and had to seek medical treatment due to the stress.”  In a statement issued to CNN, Carter said that the woman’s inconsistencies “proves” that Buzbee “filed a false complaint against me in the pursuit of money and fame.”  “This incident didn’t happen and yet he filed it in court and doubled down in the press,” Carter’s statement continued. “True Justice is coming. We fight FROM victory, not FOR victory. This was over before it began. This 1-800 lawyer doesn’t realize it yet, but, soon.”  Carter’s attorney, Alex Spiro, told CNN: “It is stunning that a lawyer would not only file such a serious complaint without proper vetting, but would make things worse by further peddling this false story in the press. We are asking the Court to dismiss this frivolous case today, and will take up the matter of additional discipline for Mr. Buzbee and all the lawyers that filed the complaint.”  Spiro also filed a letter to the judge on Friday night, regarding the inconsistencies in Jane Doe’s account, calling her allegations a “sham.”  “Basic facts in her narrative – the who, what, when, and where – are wrong,” Spiro wrote to the judge. “When pressed, the Plaintiff admitted she was ‘guessing’ about key details… She admits she has no single corroborating witness over the last 24 years.”  Prior to Buzbee filing Jane Doe’s amended complaint in which Carter was named, Carter’s lawyers had filed an extortion suit against Buzbee, claiming that the Houston-based attorney was trying to “shakedown innocent celebrities, politicians, and businesspeople with an army of masked accusers.”  Lawyers for Combs, who has previously denied all civil allegations against him, criticized Buzbee in a statement to CNN.  “This is the beginning of the end of this shameful money grab.”"

The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said. Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and about 300 miles northwest of Sacramento."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,International,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,International,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/india/india-pollution-kids-health-hnk-intl/index.html,CNN,left,International,Delhi smog: Meet the kids struggling to breathe in India’s choked capital,"New Delhi CNN —  As pollution worsens in the Indian capital, parents are facing an impossible choice: stay or go.  Amrita Rosha, 45, is among those choosing to flee with her children. Both of them — Vanaaya, 4, and Abhiraj, 9 — suffer from respiratory problems due to rising pollution and need medication.  “We have no other option but to leave Delhi,” Rosha, a housewife who is married to a businessman, told CNN last month from her home in an affluent South Delhi neighborhood as she completed last-minute packing before leaving for the Gulf state of Oman.  Every year for the past decade, a blanket of smog has enveloped Delhi when winter approaches, turning day into night and disrupting the lives of millions of people. Some of them, particularly young children with less developed immune systems, are forced to seek medical care for breathing issues.  Rosha ensures her children get top health care — including doctors’ visits, steamers, inhalers and steroids — and trips outside Delhi to escape the choking air.  Amrita Rosha with her children Vanaaya, 4, and Abhiraj, 9, in her bungalow in South Delhi. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  While wealthy families like the Roshas can escape, it’s a different story for those without the means to leave.  About 15 miles away in a Delhi slum, Muskan, who goes by her first name, looks on with worry at the remaining medicine drops for her children’s nebulizer, a machine which turns liquid medication into fine mist to be inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece.  The mother rations its use because she struggles to afford more.  “We give half-half (of the dosage) of the medicines to our children,” she said, referring to Chahat, 3, and Diya, 1. They’ve been on nebulizers since each of their first winters, as early as they were born.  Muskan bought the $9 nebulizer after weeks of hard work on the streets. She makes a living picking up rags and other pieces of refuse, and her husband is a day laborer.  “When they cough, I feel scared that my children may die. I’m filled with regret, as I keep worrying about something awful happening to them,” she said.  Muskan holds her daughter Diya while while her 3-year-old son Chahat uses the nebulizer. “He thinks it is a toy,” she said as he puts it on himself with ease. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  Leaving Delhi  The suffering of Delhi’s children, year after year, has become impossible to ignore.  “Children are having to rely on steroids and inhalers to breathe … all of north India has been pushed into a medical emergency,” Delhi’s Chief Minister Atishi, who goes by her first name, said last month.  The Supreme Court has stepped in to monitor the measures introduced to curb pollution, which is generally caused by a combination of factors including vehicular emissions, crop burning and construction work, along with unfavorable meteorological and climatic conditions.  This has included banning cars, demolition and construction work, and spraying roads with water. Authorities have also increased public transport and cracked down on crop burning.  Despite these measures, Delhi has remained the most polluted city across India in November for eight years, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.  Manjinder Singh Randhawa, a doctor in the pediatric intensive care unit at the Rainbow Children’s Hospital, said this year he has been diagnosing younger children with asthma in “a very critical state” for the first time.  Video Ad Feedback India's toxic smog puts children at risk 02:54 - Source: CNN  In the long-term, pollution can have a serious impact on the respiratory, immune and cardiovascular systems, he added.  CNN has reached out for comment to the central and state government, and the Commission for Air Quality Management responsible for maintaining air quality in the region.  In some parts of Delhi last month, pollution levels exceeded 1,750 on the Air Quality Index, according to IQAir, which monitors global air pollution. Any reading above 300 is considered a health hazard.  During these weeks the pollution levels for PM 2.5, smaller particles which can penetrate deep into the lungs, spiked to more than 70 times the health limits set by the World Health Organization. It was over 20 times that level this week. Studies indicate that inhaling PM 2.5 can lead to cognitive impairment in children.  A costly escape  Some parents, like Deepthi Ramdas, prioritized their children’s health and relocated years ago. When her son Rudra was born three years ago, she did not think leaving Delhi would ever be on the cards. But that changed when she saw him admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in January 2022.  The doctors told her she should leave Delhi if she wanted her son’s lungs to develop, Deepthi recalled. Since she had family in the southern state of Kerala, she decided to go.  “It was not an easy decision. I had to quit my job which I loved… and because my husband had to continue to be in Delhi for work… we got into a long-distance marriage,” she said.  Deepthi Ramdas' son was hospitalized when he was less than a year old in 2022. “We keep this as a keepsake to remember one of his worst times yet,” she said. Deepthi Ramdas  But Deepthi finds relief in knowing Rudra has had no breathing issues in Kerala. They visited Delhi in the first week of December to meet their father. “We hoped since he is 3 now (that) his lungs would be stronger, but within a few days Rudra had an attack and was on nebulizers again,” Deepthi said.  “Looking at him like that was heartbreaking. There is no way I am moving back to Delhi,” she said, sharing pictures of Rudra from when he was in hospital in 2022 to him playing outdoors in Kerala in October.  Anxiety in the air  Many parents in Delhi are living under anxiety fueled by their inability to escape the city due to work and other commitments.  “This is not something you just do, you have to plan it, and be fortunate enough,” 29-year-old mother Urvee Parasramka told CNN. Her daughter Reva, 2, has been on nebulizers since her first winter, she said.  When Urvee was expecting, she recalls her husband, Prateek Tulsyan, responding to news of pollution by saying he’d ensure there were enough air purifiers at home to protect his child. However, nine months after delivery, Reva had her first attack.  “There was a lot of panic then. It was hard to understand why she even needed such heavy medication. I was very scared. It took me a while to come around,” Prateek told CNN.  Urvee added: “I am constantly checking her temperature, do not allow her to go out or eat anything that may exacerbate her condition. I am now an over-protective parent.”  If she hears Reva sneeze, she knows a cough is coming, followed by congestion and then the need for the nebulizer.  Urvee said they’ve decided to move to Guwahati, northeast India, where the air quality is better, during the high pollution months next year.  “I am born and brought up here, comfortable here, so to create another home there won’t be easy but we have no choice,” she said.  No way out  Muskan and her neighbors in the Delhi slum are not as fortunate.  She runs to the shared nebulizer when her children show symptoms like chest pain, coughing or vomiting. She says the children ask for it themselves and use it with practiced precision. But not everyone is able to afford to have the machine at home.  Some of her neighbors rush to the nearest private clinic and pay about 80 rupees or $1 for each treatment.  One of them is Deepak Kumar, a daily wage worker with four children. His youngest and only daughter, Kripa, 1, is using a nebulizer for the second consecutive winter season since her birth.  Deepak Kumar holds his daughter Kripa, 1, for whom he has had to take on debt to pay for urgent medical expenses. “If I put her down she starts crying,” he said. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  “The doctor asked us to buy it, but we do not have that kind of money,” he said.  One visit to the doctor costs more than his daily wage.  Nights are the worst. When there are no doctors available, he relies on balms and steam to help his daughter get through the night. Even when she is sleeping well, the mounting debt due to medical expenses keeps him awake.  “Yes, I am in debt of 20,000 rupees ($235) and to pay that off I am trying to work even harder,” he said.  Many like Kumar have come to Delhi from different parts of India to seek a better life, but they’re stuck.  “It should not be so hard to live in the capital,” he said."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/science/oldest-human-dna-neanderthal-ancestry/index.html,CNN,left,International,Oldest human DNA helps pinpoint when early humans interbred with Neanderthals,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  Scientists say they have recovered the oldest known Homo sapiens DNA from human remains found in Europe, and the information is helping to reveal our species’ shared history with Neanderthals.  The ancient genomes sequenced from 13 bone fragments unearthed in a cave beneath a medieval castle in Ranis, Germany, belonged to six individuals, including a mother, daughter and distant cousins who lived in the region around 45,000 years ago, according to the study that published Thursday in the journal Nature.  The genomes carried evidence of Neanderthal ancestry. Researchers determined that the ancestors of those early humans who lived in Ranis and the surrounding area likely encountered and made babies with Neanderthals about 80 generations earlier, or 1,500 years earlier, although that interaction did not necessarily happen in the same place.  Scientists have known since the first Neanderthal genome was sequenced in 2010 that early humans interbred with Neanderthals, a bombshell revelation that bequeathed a genetic legacy still traceable in humans today.  However, exactly when, how often and where this critical and mysterious juncture in human history took place has been hard to pin down. Scientists have believed interspecies relations would have occurred somewhere in the Middle East as a wave of Homo sapiens left Africa and bumped into Neanderthals, who had lived across Eurasia for 250,000 years.  The cave where the ancient human remains were found is located beneath a castle in Ranis, Germany. Martin Schutt/picture alliance/Getty Images  A broader study on Neanderthal ancestry, published Thursday in the journal Science, that analyzed information from the genomes of 59 ancient humans and those of 275 living humans corroborated the more precise timeline, finding that the majority of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans can be attributed to a “single, shared extended period of gene flow.”  “We were far more similar than we were different,” Priya Moorjani, a senior author of the Science study and an assistant professor in the department of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, said at a news briefing.  “The differences that we imagined between these groups to be very big, actually, were very small, genetically speaking. They seem to have mixed with each other for a long period of time and were living side by side for a long period of time.”  The research pinpointed a pivotal period that began about 50,500 years ago and ended around 43,500 years ago — not long before the now extinct Neanderthals began to disappear from the archaeological record. Over this 7,000-year time frame, early humans encountered Neanderthals, had sex and gave birth to children on a fairly regular basis. The height of the activity was 47,000 years ago, the study suggested.  The research also showed how certain genetic variants inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors, which make up between 1% and 3% of our genomes today, varied over time. Some, such as those related to the immune system, were beneficial to humans as they lived through the last ice age, when temperatures were much cooler, and they continue to confer benefits today.  The two studies lend “substantial confidence” to the timing of when humans and Neanderthals exchanged genes, something geneticists describe as introgression, said evolutionary geneticist Tony Capra, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics in the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute at the University of California, San Francisco.  “Genetic data from this crucial period in our evolution are very rare,” said Capra, who wasn’t involved in the research, via email. “These studies underscore how having even a few ancient genomes provides powerful perspective that enabled the authors to refine our understanding of human migration and Neanderthal introgression.”  A skull found in Zlatý kůň in the Czech Republic contains DNA that linked the woman to the Ranis individuals. Marek Jantač  The scientists working on the two research projects decided to publish their work at the same time when they realized they had separately reached a similar conclusion.  How Neanderthal ancestry has shaped human genes  The research in Science found that genetic variants inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors are unevenly distributed across the human genome.  Some regions, which the scientists call “archaic deserts,” are devoid of Neanderthal genes. These deserts likely developed quickly after the two groups interbred, within 100 generations, perhaps because they resulted in birth defects or diseases that would have affected the survival chances of the offspring.  “It suggests that hybrid individuals who had Neanderthal DNA in these regions were substantially less fit, likely to due to severe disease, lethality, or infertility,” Capra said via email.  In particular, the X chromosome was a desert. Capra said the effects of Neanderthal variants that cause disease could be greater on the X chromosome, perhaps because it is present in two copies in females, but only present in one copy in males.  “The X chromosome also has many genes that are linked to male fertility when modified, so it has been proposed that some of this effect could have come from introgression leading to male hybrid sterility,” he said.  The Neanderthal gene variants detected most frequently in ancient and modern Homo sapiens genomes are related to traits and functions that included immune function, skin pigmentation and metabolism, with some increasing in frequency over time.  “Neanderthals were living outside Africa in harsh, ice age climates and were adapted to the climate and to the pathogens in these environments. When modern humans left Africa and interbred with Neanderthals, some individuals inherited Neanderthal genes that presumably allowed them to adapt and thrive better in the environment,” said Leonardo Iasi, co-lead author of the Science paper and a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.  The individuals living at Ranis had 2.9% Neanderthal ancestry, not dissimilar to most people today, the Nature study found.  The new timeline allows scientists to understand better when humans left Africa and migrated around the world. It suggested that the main wave of migration out of Africa was essentially done by 43,500 years ago because most humans outside Africa today have Neanderthal ancestry originating from this period, the Science study suggested.  However, there is still much scientists don’t know. It’s not clear why people in East Asia today have more Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans, or why Neanderthal genomes from this period show little evidence of Homo sapiens DNA.  While the genomes sequenced from the Ranis individuals are the oldest Homo sapiens ones, scientists have previously recovered and analyzed DNA from Neanderthal remains that date back 400,000 years.  Lost branch of the human family tree  The individuals who called the cave in Ranis home were among the first Homo sapiens to live in Europe.  These early Europeans numbered a few hundred and included a woman who lived 230 kilometers (143 miles) away in Zlatý kůň in the Czech Republic. DNA from her skull was sequenced in a previous study, and researchers involved in the Nature study were able to connect her to the Ranis individuals.  These individuals had dark skin, dark hair and brown eyes, according to the study, perhaps reflecting their relatively recent arrival from Africa. Scientists are continuing to study remains from the site to piece together their diet and how they lived.  The family group was part of a pioneer population that eventually died out, leaving no trace of ancestry in people alive today. Other lineages of ancient humans also went extinct around 40,000 years ago and disappeared just like the Neanderthals ultimately did, said Johannes Krause, director at the department of archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. These extinctions may suggest that Homo sapiens did not play a role in the demise of Homo neanderthalensis.  “It’s kind of interesting to see that human story is not always a story of success,” said Krause, a senior author of the Nature study."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/sport/lindsey-vonn-world-cup-skiing-return-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,left,International,Lindsey Vonn to make World Cup skiing return in St. Moritz,"CNN —  Skiing great Lindsey Vonn has announced that she will make her World Cup return at St Moritz, Switzerland next weekend.  In a video posted by her sponsor, Red Bull, on Friday, the 40-year-old Vonn said: “So, I have some news. My body is finally put back together and I hear St Moritz is pretty nice this time of year.”  Vonn announced her retirement from competitive skiing in 2019 after 18 years on the World Cup circuit. In that time, she recorded 82 World Cup race wins, eight world championship medals and three Winter Olympic medals.  After undergoing successful partial knee replacement surgery earlier this year, the American star decided to return to ski racing.  “I feel stronger now than I did in my late 20s,” she said, per Reuters. “The passion for skiing has never gone away, I just wasn’t physically able to do it anymore.  “It was pretty soon after surgery and in the rehab process that I was already doing things that I hadn’t done in years,” she added.  “My body was just functioning better. Obviously, I am a lot happier because I’m not in pain 24 hours a day. I’m getting stronger and better and faster than I was for a long, long period of time.”  Vonn recently competed in lower-level events in Copper Mountain, Colorado in order to gain eligibility to compete at World Cup races.  According to The Associated Press, she will race in two super-G events in St. Moritz, where she has previously won five World Cup titles. The super-G competitions in the Swiss resort are scheduled to take place on December 21 and 22.  The US Ski Team confirmed to CNN that Vonn will compete in St. Moritz.  “One thing I realized is that life is really short,” Vonn said in the video posted by Red Bull. “If you have an opportunity, you have to take it. There’s nothing that I love more than ski racing.”  Vonn’s haul of 82 World Cup wins puts her third on the all-time list behind Sweden’s Ingemar Stenmark on 86 and compatriot Mikaela Shiffrin on 99."
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/christmas-railway-station-romance-chance-encounters/index.html,CNN,left,International,Her flight was delayed and she missed her train home for Christmas. Then she met her future husband on the platform,"CNN —  When frazzled twentysomething traveler Jennea arrived at London’s King’s Cross railway station on December 15, 2013, the station was absolutely packed.  Carol singers in one corner were singing with gusto, collecting money for charity in brightly colored buckets. Gathered in the middle of the Victorian concourse, crowds of travelers stood, wrapped in coats and scarfs, looking up at the departure boards, waiting for their platform to be announced.  Passengers jostled past each other, armed with bags of gifts and large suitcases. Exhausted and a little overwhelmed, Jennea still found time to be charmed by the festive atmosphere. She took a moment to put down her heavy bag and check the departure board, searching for her train.  Jennea, who’d grown up in the US, had spent the last 18 months in Mozambique, where she’d been volunteering for the US Peace Corps. She hadn’t seen her loved ones in almost two years, and now she was en route to reunite with them in Cambridge, England.  The thought of hugging her mom, catching up with her aunt and uncle and distributing her gifts to her family kept Jennea going as she hoisted her heavy backpack onto her back, and headed towards her platform.  “I was absolutely loaded down — two suitcases, a backpackers’ backpack, my handbag…” Jennea tells CNN Travel today. “It’s Christmastime. I’m packed to the brim with Christmas presents. Making my way through King’s Cross Station, completely absorbed.”  When Jennea got to the platform, it was unnervingly empty. This was surprising.  “I remember thinking, ‘This platform is very quiet. It’s so close to Christmas and it’s King’s Cross, that’s bizarre. I don’t even know if I’m in the right place. What if I’ve misread the platform number incorrectly?’”  Jennea glanced around for someone to ask. She couldn’t see a train guard or another passenger.  “And not only that, there were two trains on the platform as well.”  It wasn’t clear which was the right train.  Jennea felt herself start to panic. She was already leaving London much later than she’d initially planned. And she was exhausted from traveling from the Mozambique village where she was volunteering to Malawi, then to Kenya, then to the UK.  “It took four days,” Jennea recalls. “And even then, when I finally landed in London, there was this massive delay on the airplane.  “Because of this, I had missed my plan A train, my plan B train, my plan everything train… It was 2013 and I didn’t have an iPhone yet. I couldn’t get a hold of my aunt and uncle who were going to be picking me up.”  Just as Jennea felt the stress and tiredness start to overwhelm her, she heard a voice behind her.  “Excuse me, is this the train to Cambridge?”  A train station conversation  Jennea and Arthur immediately hit it off at King's Cross railway station in December 2013. Dreamcapture Fotografie  Jennea turned around and saw a man, also wrapped in a hat and scarf, but significantly less weighed down by luggage.  “I was so relieved,” recalls Jennea. “I replied, ‘Oh I hope it’s going to Cambridge. That’s where I’m going.’”  As she spoke, Jennea realized she hadn’t had a conversation in four days — other than perfunctory airport and airplane interactions. She felt a strange feeling of ease with this stranger, who smiled at her and offered to help her with her bags as they boarded the train together.  As Jennea apologized for the heaviness of her luggage and the guy told her not to worry about it, Jennea thought she detected something familiar in his voice.  “Are you American?” she asked.  “No, I’m Dutch,” he said, smiling. “But I live in London. I’m Arthur.”  “I’m Jennea,” said Jennea, smiling back.  In mutual, unspoken agreement, Jennea and Arthur — who have requested their last names not be included in this story for privacy reasons — sat down on the train, opposite one another. They carried on talking.  “It was just very easy conversation,” recalls Jennea.  The carriage gradually filled up, and an overhead announcement confirmed the train was heading to Cambridge.  Arthur asked Jennea what brought her to the UK, and Jennea explained her mother was Irish, that she had family in Ireland and the UK, and they were all gathering there for the festive period.  As for Arthur, he explained he’d moved to London for college a few years previously. He was currently working in finance while he studied part time for a PhD — and he wasn’t heading to Cambridge for the holidays, but for something a little more unusual.  “I’d been invited to go to Cambridge by a friend of mine who was a novice monk,” Arthur tells CNN Travel today. “He basically invited me to spend a few days as a mini retreat away from the Big Smoke.”  Arthur had approached Jennea on the platform because he was confused about the train.  “It was initially purely functional dialogue,” is how Arthur puts it. “Trying to get on the train, trying to get to Cambridge… but then it quickly morphed into a very easygoing conversation about lots of different topics. It felt like there was a lot of common ground.”  “People say, ‘Was it love at first sight?’” says Jennea, of that first interaction with Arthur. “And I say this lovingly, but no, no, it wasn’t. It was just relief: ‘Thank God there’s someone else on the platform.’ And then it was functional. ‘Okay, where am I going? What am I doing?’ But then we sat down, and started talking.”  For both Arthur and Jennea, this conversation was the hook. They were intrigued by each other. Arthur knew nothing about the Peace Corps. Jennea was fascinated by the idea of having a friend who was a monk. Their conversation just flowed.  As the train — now full of people — weaved its way through the series of tunnels that carry trains northward out of King’s Cross, Arthur and Jennea kept talking.  “There wasn’t that point where it became awkward and silent and you’re thinking, ‘Do I dig out my book and pretend to read now?’” says Jennea. “No. We chatted the entire time.”  About an hour later, the train pulled into Cambridge station, and Arthur helped Jennea gather her many bags. They exchanged details, promising to add one another on Facebook, and they were still deep in conversation as the train pulled to a halt.  “Then, as we stepped off onto the platform, my aunt and my uncle were actually right there, and I was so relieved because they’d waited for me,” says Jennea. “I hadn’t seen my family in years at this point, it had been a long time, so I just threw my arms around my uncle, and then my aunt.”  Meanwhile Arthur hung back, still holding Jennea’s suitcases.  “He was standing there with my bags — my aunt said, ‘Oh my gosh, look at you. You’ve gone all the way to Mozambique, and you’ve come back, and here’s a man standing with your bags. What have you done?’” recalls Jennea, laughing.  “It was kind of an, ‘Alright, bye,’ moment,” says Arthur, also laughing.  Arthur and Jennea didn’t hug farewell — they both suddenly felt a little awkward in that moment. But as they walked in opposite directions, they each turned around to smile at one another, and wave.  “I was sort of thinking, ‘Oh, that was really nice. What a great start to my Christmas holidays,’” recalls Jennea. “But I had no idea what would happen next.”  Staying in touch  Arthur and Jennea had lots in common from the outset and stayed in touch after their railway meeting. Arthur and Jennea  When Jennea got to her aunt’s house, she spent the next couple of hours catching up with her family, sharing stories of her mammoth journey and her work in Mozambique.  Later, when she finally connected to the Wi-Fi on her cell phone, Jennea saw she had a friend request from Arthur. She accepted, and he sent through a message right away, saying how great it was to meet her.  “And then we just kept exchanging Facebook messages back and forth over the holidays,” says Jennea. “I kept sneaking away into the room I was staying at my aunt’s house to try and message privately.”  Jennea and Arthur picked back up the conversation they’d started on the train, sending instant messages regularly back and forth. After a couple of days, they started talking on the phone.  A few days before Christmas, Jennea’s parents arrived in Cambridge.  “As soon as my mom arrived, my aunt said, ‘I think she’s met someone in the UK.’ And my mom was like, ‘Who did she meet? She’s only just landed?’” recalls Jenna. “And so then I always had a — very well-meaning, but nosy — relative, always coming into the bedroom, just putting laundry away, whenever I was on the phone with Arthur.”  “Which I would hear in the background, by the way, when we would be talking,” adds Arthur. “I’d suddenly hear, ‘Can you see me? I’m the pretty aunt.’”  Jennea was set to return to Mozambique early in the new year. She still had another 12 months of her Peace Corps contract. It wasn’t obvious where this connection with Arthur would or could go. But then Arthur invited Jennea to visit him in London for a couple of days before she returned.  “My mom was like, ‘Absolutely not. He could be an axe murderer. You just don’t know,’” says Jennea. “While my aunt was saying, ‘You’re just young once, and you only live once, so take a chance and see what happens.’”  Jennea tried not to be swayed by either of their opinions.  “I mean, as an adult, I was able to make my own decisions,” she points out.  Jennea knew she wanted to see Arthur again. So she got the train back from Cambridge to London, where Arthur was waiting, smiling, in the station concourse.  “We were in London together for just 24 hours,” says Arthur. “It was quite special. We were able to squeeze basically lots of different dates into that period of time.”  It was the end of December — that time between Christmas and the new year when many people in the UK are off work, the Christmas lights are still twinkling and there’s a sense of expectation in the air as January 31 gets ever closer. It was the perfect backdrop for falling in love.  “It was a very magical day,” says Jennea. “We went to different restaurants, museums, and saw a show.”  Arthur had planned out the whole day.  “And all the things that he had planned, they were things that I really enjoy doing as well,” says Jennea. “So there was this thought of, ‘What you like doing is what I like doing,.’”  “It was just one day in London. But it really sealed the deal.”  Arthur felt the same way, saying this time together, “helped establish a strong bond.”  But when Jennea left for Mozambique, she and Arthur promised to take “everything one day at a time.”  Neither of them had been looking for romance when they met. And both were conscious that Jennea living on another continent would be tough to navigate.  “My approach to it was, ‘If I keep talking to Arthur, that’s wonderful, and that’s great. And if not, I had a great time. Everything was lovely,’” says Jennea.  “And so I think because I wasn’t expecting and hoping and putting that pressure on, it always remained a very safe space, if that makes sense — super organic. It was just very relaxed, one day at a time without the pressure and I think the distance permitted that — but also knowing that the distance was temporary, I think that’s a really important mixture in starting a long-distance relationship.”  Jennea and Arthur kept in touch while she was away via regular phone calls.  “We would call and chat, building the relationship and getting to know each other,” says Jennea. “I looked forward to those phone calls. We’d ask: ‘What are your hopes and dreams for the future? What’s your family like? Do you have siblings? Happiest memory…’ That kind of thing… And also just, ‘How do you like your toast?’”  “Jennea was someone that liked going into depth on different things,” says Arthur. “And also someone I could laugh with. Someone with a sense of humor. I think that was very appealing.”  A few months in, Arthur visited Jennea in Mozambique in spring 2015.  “It was surreal when I saw Arthur again,” recalls Jennea. “I couldn’t believe he traveled across the world to come and visit me. I traveled six hours via public transport to meet him at the Nampula airport so it’s safe to say we were both feeling a little more invested in our relationship at that point.”  Jennea waited for Arthur at the airport holding “a giant homemade welcome sign for him in Dutch.”  The Mozambique visit was really exciting for both Arthur and Jennea, and further confirmed their certainty in the relationship and its potential future.  “It gave me a deep appreciation for the volunteering Jennea did, which really was a defining experience for her,” says Arthur.  And as the months rolled on, Jennea started considering what she’d do after her Peace Corps contract ended. She was interested in teaching, but wasn’t sure where she’d end up based.  “My original plan was to return to the US and to go into graduate school. And in the United States, you have to take an entrance exam in order to get into graduate school. So I convinced myself that it would be worth it to go to London and take this exam, because then I could stay with Arthur,” says Jennea.  In the moment, Jennea told herself — and everyone else in her life — that she was saving money by not having to pay for hotel accommodation, even though she could have done the exam somewhere closer and saved the plane fare.  “It was an excuse,” Jennea says. “I wasn’t fooling anyone. But then I went to London and stayed with Arthur for two weeks.”  During that period, Jennea talked to Arthur about her graduate school plans, and interest in teaching, but mentioned nothing was set in stone.  “I’m open to various options,” she told him.  “Well, you know, London is an option,” said Arthur.  Jennea raised an eyebrow, not sure what to make of this.  “I remember thinking, ‘What does that mean? I’m fully aware that I could move to London, but are you asking me to live with you?’” she says today. “And yes, that was his very romantic way of saying, ‘Will you live with me? London’s an option.’”  Life in London  After Jennea introduced Arthur to her extended family during a Minnesota-based Thanksgiving at the end of 2014 — a trip she calls “a lot of fun” — she made the choice to move to the UK to be with Arthur.  This decision was made a little easier thanks to Jennea’s mother’s Irish roots.  “Fortunately, I have dual-citizenship with Ireland and the USA,” she says. “I was therefore spared any visa hardships, luckily.”  And at the beginning of 2015, she moved into Arthur’s apartment in Poplar, east London — which he’d just purchased.  “The wallpaper was a bit 1970s, so we had this shared project of updating this flat together, and I think for us living together for the first time in this big city, and adjusting, it was helpful, because I wasn’t moving into his space right away. We were both starting out in this new space,” Jennea says.  “We were building new memories together, in a new area,” adds Arthur.  Jennea and Arthur moved in together in London in 2015. MoMi Photo  The couple also adopted a cat from Battersea Cats and Dogs Home, an animal rescue center in London.  “That was also really nice, because we had our little friend, and it was nice to come home to him,” says Jennea, who started training to become an elementary school teacher not long after she moved to the UK.  Life in London was an adjustment from her time in the Peace Corps — and living in the UK was also different from Jennea’s childhood in the US. But her Cambridge family weren’t too far away. And Jennea was excited to create her own family unit with Arthur.  “We were just very easy together,” she says. “It just felt cozy. It felt like home when we were together. I found security.”  When Jennea moved to London, she and Arthur and just celebrated their one year “meet-a-versary,” as she calls it.  As a gift, Arthur gave Jennea a ceramic tile, a type of traditional Dutch pottery, with a personalized inscription: “A phrase in Dutch that translates to, “The measurement of love is love without measurement.”  Underneath the words was the date Arthur and Jennea first met: December 15, 2013.  Proposal and marriage  Jennea and Arthur on their wedding day in Curacao. Arthur calls the day ""incredible and very memorable."" Claudia Sanches/Wow Wedding Details  After a couple of years enjoying London life, Arthur proposed to Jennea while they were on vacation in Bruges, Belgium.  “Arthur proposed after giving me a heartfelt letter about his love for me and got down on one knee,” says Jennea.  In the spring of 2017, Jennea and Arthur got married in Curacao, a Dutch Caribbean island.  “We chose a place that inconvenienced guests equally,” jokes Jennea before adding that they were attracted to the beauty of the island, and the fact it was “neither a ‘his’ nor ‘hers’ wedding destination.”  It was, says Arthur, “incredible and very memorable — having all of our closest family and friends in Curacao for a four day party.”  “For the entire week, when we walked down the street we always bumped into friends or family,” recalls Jennea.  “The day itself was sunny, clear blue skies and warm. I had had a sleepover with the bridesmaids/girls the night before and I was ready to party and say yes to living the rest of my life with Arthur by my side. It was just such a great buzz.”  The speeches included a couple of mentions of Arthur and Jennea’s unlikely train station meeting — including three of Arthur’s friends performing a little skit about the meeting, and the couple’s life together since.  “I have a lot of happy memories of that day. It’s definitely a moment in time I like to relive and enjoy,” says Jennea.  Arthur says he also felt “deeply happy” and also really “grateful” to be marrying Jennea.  Tougher times  From the early days of their relationship, Arthur and Jennea had talked about wanting children. The couple first discussed this mutual desire on one of their many long, in-depth cross-continental phone calls.  They figured once they were married, and more settled with careers and life, they’d start trying for kids.  “But this turned out to be very difficult,” says Jennea. “We really struggled with infertility, and that was something that was really hard, because everything else was so easy between us. When we started trying for kids, it just kind of felt ‘What’s wrong?’ This life we had envisioned together — it wasn’t necessarily clear whether or not we would ever have that.”  As the uncertainty and heartbreak stretched over several years, Jennea and Arthur navigated the ups and downs as a team.  “We’d be open about the challenges, having those conversations emotionally,” says Arthur. “But then also not being stuck in that anxiety or concern or frustration, but trying to convert that into, ‘Where do we go from here, together?’”  Arthur also credits the couple’s “wider social circle, family and friends” who helped support them through this period.  And then, in 2020, Jennea and Arthur had a successful round of IVF, welcoming a daughter.  “We got very lucky,” says Jennea.  A few years later, in summer 2023, the couple had a second child, a son.  “We have another little baby, also with the help of IVF,” says Jennea. “We just feel very fortunate to have what we have now.”  Life today  Jennea, Arthur and their two kids now live in the Netherlands. Arthur and Jennea  Today, Jennea and Arthur live in the Hague, in the Netherlands, with their two young children. The couple moved to Arthur’s home country when they became parents.  This was partly a career decision after Britain left the European Union, and partly a personal decision.  “Arthur’s career was moved from London to Amsterdam following Brexit, and then Arthur’s family also lives here,” explains Jennea. “So as I was pregnant and about to give birth, the thought was, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be nice to be closer to Arthur’s immediate family?’”  Today, says Jennea, the couple are nostalgic about their London life — “all the museums, going for drinks with your friends — there’s just so much going on in London, how could you not love it?”  They always enjoy returning — especially to King’s Cross station, where it all began.  “Kings Cross station definitely holds a special place in our hearts,” says Jennea. “We always hold hands and kiss when we walk through together. When we brought our daughter there the first time, that was a magical moment. I’m looking forward to bringing our son there in the future.”  It’s that wonderful festive energy, the exciting chaos, that engulfs the days leading up to Christmas that I associate with our love story. Jennea  Over a decade later, Jennea says she still thinks “meeting at a train station is romantic. It feels nostalgic in a way, like an old movie meet-cute.”  Jennea and Arthur also always associate the month of December with their love story.  “It’s that wonderful festive energy, the exciting chaos, that engulfs the days leading up to Christmas that I associate with our love story,” she says.  The couple always take a moment to “set aside time to be with just each other at this point in the year, and tell each other just how grateful we are that we met,” adds Jennea.  “To our friends/family, it has been compared to a Bollywood scene,” says Arthur, who adds he has a strong feeling that bumping into Jennea that day was “meant to be.”  “I honestly still count myself incredibly lucky because it was so serendipitous,” agrees Jennea.  “If things had gone to ‘plan’ — no delayed plane or luggage, not having missed my original trains to Cambridge, etc. I never would have met Arthur. Our paths just wouldn’t have crossed. We were living in two totally different worlds and this really feels like it was fate. Eleven years later, we’re still together and with two kids, all due to a chance encounter on a train platform.”"

Here’s how to best view it,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  As the winter nights grow longer, those in the Northern Hemisphere will want to keep an eye out this weekend for the last full moon of the year. The silvery orb will shine bright in the sky for a hair more than 16 hours on Saturday evening into Sunday morning.  Known as the long night moon or the cold moon, it’s set to reach peak illumination at 4:02 a.m. ET Sunday, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. However, the moon will appear round to the naked eye for about three days, according to NASA.  For those in the Southern Hemisphere, which had a long visibility moon in June, the December full moon will appear for a shorter time and will follow a lower arch in the sky, said Sara Russell, research scientist and head of the Planetary Materials Group at London’s Natural History Museum.  “For those of us in the northern hemisphere, the Moon will seem to reach higher in the sky than you might expect,” Russell said in an email.  The sun, moon and Earth are on about the same plane, with the full moon occurring when Earth is between the moon and the sun as the moon orbits our planet. “In December, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, the Sun is low and has a short track across the sky, so the opposite Moon has a high and long track,” Russell added.  Observing the cold moon  The cold moon’s name is a nod to the bitter weather typically found in the Northern Hemisphere this time of year. The name comes from the Mohawk people, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac, which has names for each full moon that historically derive from Native Americans, Colonial Americans or other sources.  For best viewing of the cold moon, Russell recommended looking when it has just risen or is about to set to see it near the horizon. Wrap up in warm layers if you’re in colder weather and aim to look when there are clear skies in your area, she said.  “We are so lucky on Earth to have the Moon. There’s nowhere else in our Solar system where there is a planet and moon so proportionately close in size — the Moon is almost like our smaller twin,” Russell said. “It is better at preserving all of its history than is the surface of the Earth, and we can look up to its cratered surface to see how battered by impacts both the Moon and Earth have been over their 4.5 billion-year history.”  Those observing the moon can ponder the questions yet to be answered about the neighboring celestial object, such as the mysteries surrounding the far side of the moon, theories about the water-rich lunar poles or the possibility of humans one day living on permanent bases there, Russell said.  Upcoming celestial events  This year, the December full moon occurs one week before the winter solstice, an astronomical event caused by the Earth’s tilt, that marks the Northern Hemisphere’s longest night and shortest day and vice versa for the Southern Hemisphere.  This year’s winter solstice, when Earth’s axis is tilted the farthest away from the sun, will be at 4:21 a.m. ET December 21, according to EarthSky.  The next full moon will be the wolf moon on January 25, according to the Farmers’ Almanac.  Meanwhile, there are two meteor showers to close out the year; the Geminids will be seen blazing in the night sky until the shower’s finality on December 21, while the Ursids will peak December 21-22, according to the American Meteor Society."

Don’t cancel your flight just yet,"Editor’s note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.  CNN —  In travel news this week: the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards, why you shouldn’t gift-wrap methamphetamine, plus infrastructure megaprojects around the world.  Bridge and tunnel crowd  There’s been a whole bunch of international infrastructure projects in the news this week, with a strong focus on digging.  Busy beavers and merry moles have been chattering about resurfaced plans for a $20 trillion transatlantic tunnel that could theoretically link London and New York in just an hour using vacuum tube technology. That’s 3,000 miles of burrowing, mind, which Newsweek estimates could take the best part of a millennium if construction proceeded at the same rate as Europe’s Channel Tunnel.  In plans that are actually happening, Norway broke ground last month on its Rogfast project, which promises to be the world’s longest, deepest undersea road tunnel. Elsewhere in northern Europe, the world’s longest road and rail tunnel, the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel between Denmark and Germany, is slated to open in 2029.  Southern Europe isn’t shy of a project or two, either. Construction of a new bridge linking Greece and Turkey might be closer to getting underway, the Greek Reporter said Friday.  Over near the western end of Europe, the UK is busy building one of the world’s most expensive railway projects, known as HS2 (High Speed 2), which now costs an almighty $416 million per mile. However, many people think it’s pointless.  That comes a few years after the UK resurfaced plans for what would have been one of the world’s most ambitious bridges, linking Britain and Ireland. It was to cross just a 12-mile stretch, but the waters were deep enough to submerge the Eiffel Tower. Then there was the matter of all the radioactive waste and unexploded munitions. Unsurprisingly, plans were dropped.  Baggage blues  A top musician who played at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was forced to cancel a concert this week after Air Canada refused to give his multi-million-dollar cello a seat on the plane.  For others, the trouble only starts at the baggage carousel, although there’s progress on easing some of the pain of that. United Airlines has rolled out a new way to track lost luggage with AirTags, with users being able to share location information directly with the airline. Other carriers, including Delta, Lufthansa and Qantas, are set to follow suit.  Finally, Japan Airlines has announced a baggage delivery service for travelers that will allow luggage to be dropped off at customers’ hotels for a fee. The idea is to reduce overcrowding on Tokyo’s public transport.  Naughty or nice?  It’s always a bad idea to put wrapped Christmas presents in your airplane luggage – if they raise concerns with airport security, they’re likely to be unwrapped.  It’s an even worse idea when the “presents” are actually 10 kilos of methamphetamine, as happened at a New Zealand airport this week.  This Christmas, we hope that your holidays are not felonious, but felicitous — like American Jennea and Dutchman Arthur.  Jennea’s flight from Mozambique was delayed and she missed her train out of London to see her loved ones for Christmas. Then she met her future husband on the platform.  Should you have the misfortune of finding yourself similarly in the winter chill this holiday season, but without the comfort of a lover’s hand to hold, you can always console yourself with a pair of heated gloves.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.  CNN —  “Even though you want to try to, never grow up,” Peter Pan said in the titular novel by J.M. Barrie, echoing a sentiment long expressed by the human race in an effort to cheat death.  The quest to unlock the secrets of longevity has been the topic of scientific study for decades. And some of the greatest lessons about living a long life come from nature itself.  Take Jonathan the giant tortoise, for instance. It is believed that the tortoise, a resident of the remote South Atlantic island of St. Helena, was likely born in 1832 — but he may be more than 200 years old since the exact date of his birth remains unknown.  Although blind and lacking a sense of smell, Jonathan still has sharp hearing for his advanced age and sunbathes during mild weather.  But even though giant tortoises are known for their exceptionally long lives, they may be outranked by an elusive creature of the deep.  Ocean secrets  A Greenland shark is seen swimming beneath the ice near northern Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. Avalon.red/Alamy Stock Photo  The rarely seen Greenland shark is a sluggish creature, slowly swimming through the deep waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The polar fish is the only species of shark that can withstand the freezing temperatures year-round.  The large sharks also live to be more than 400 years old, and some of them may have been alive since colonial times.  After mapping and studying their extraordinary genomes, scientists think the sharks’ unusually long lifespans are rooted in their unique genetic makeup — with insights that could be used to extend human lifespans.  Other worlds  The “Black Beauty” meteorite opened a window into studying ancient Mars when it was found in the Sahara Desert in 2011.  Astronomers believe the space rock was ejected from the Martian surface 5 million to 10 million years ago. And now, a single mineral grain inside the meteorite has revealed the oldest direct evidence of water on Mars 4.45 billion years ago.  The mineral grain was altered by hot water on Mars, which suggests that habitable environments such as hot springs may have existed on the red planet early in its history.  Meanwhile, the Perseverance rover just completed its 3 ½-month ascent up the steep rim of Jezero Crater on Mars, spotting an unusual zebra-striped rock along the way. Next up? The robotic explorer will investigate the oldest rocks on Mars to uncover more about the planet’s mysterious past.  Wild kingdom  A monarch butterfly drinks nectar from a flower in the pollinator habitat bed near the Chicago Park District storehouse in August. Tess Crowley/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images  With distinctive orange-and-black wings, monarch butterflies are easy to spot as they flit among the flowers, helping pollinate plants and encouraging biodiversity.  But monarch populations have seen a steep decline due to insecticides, habitat loss and the climate crisis — troubling enough that the US Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed adding the fragile species to the threatened species list.  If the butterflies receive the designation, more action could be taken to protect the important pollinators. But officials warn that without action, monarchs could vanish before the end of the century with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems.  Fantastic creatures  When a creature washed ashore in New Zealand in July, experts wondered whether it might be a spade-toothed whale, the world’s rarest whale that’s considered to be almost mythical because it has never been seen alive at sea.  Now, scientists studying the remains have confirmed the “really stocky, powerful-looking little animal” is indeed one of the elusive marine mammals, said Anton van Helden, an expert on some of the world’s rarest whales.  The carcass, studied by whale scientists and members of the local Māori community, yielded precious clues about the deep-sea-diving animal.  We are family  An illustration depicts early Europeans who lived in what's now Ranis, Germany, around 45,000 years ago and likely traveled together across the open steppe landscape. Tom Björklund/Max Planck Institute  Ancient DNA retrieved from bone fragments found in a cave beneath a medieval castle have helped scientists pinpoint when prehistoric humans encountered Neanderthals and made babies with them.  The bones belonged to a mother, daughter and distant cousins who lived in what’s now eastern Germany about 45,000 years ago. Their genomes revealed evidence of Neanderthal ancestry, meaning that early Homo sapiens living in the region mated with Neanderthals 1,500 years earlier.  “We were far more similar than we were different,” said Priya Moorjani, assistant professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley.  “They seem to have mixed with each other for a long period of time.”  In addition to shedding light on the shared history between humans and Neanderthals, the study also showed that the fragments belonged to a lost branch of the human family tree.

Police were called to a bar in Victoria in central London – a short walk from the palace – on Tuesday evening when a festive celebration turned violent.  A 24-year-old woman, who has not been identified, was arrested on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and of being drunk and disorderly, London’s Metropolitan Police told CNN.  The woman, who subsequently spent Tuesday night and much of the following day in a police cell, is believed to be a maid at the palace and was on a night out with around 50 members of palace staff at the time, according to The Sun newspaper.

She reportedly smashed some glasses and turned on a member of the bar staff.  Management at the royal residence say the matter is now being investigated and that disciplinary action could follow.  A palace spokesperson told the BBC: “We are aware of an incident outside the workplace involving a number of Household staff who had previously attended an early evening reception at the Palace.  “While this was an informal social gathering, not an official Palace Christmas party, the facts will be fully investigated, with a robust disciplinary process followed in relation to individual staff and appropriate action taken.”  The spokesperson told the BBC that the post-reception drinks, which staff went on to at the bar, were informal and had not been arranged by the palace.  A palace spokesperson confirmed the statement to CNN.  A spokesperson for London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed the incident to CNN in an email, saying: “At 21:21hrs on Tuesday, 10 December officers were called to a bar in Victoria Street, SW1 following reports that a customer had smashed glasses and attempted to assault a member of staff.  “Officers attended and arrested a 24-year-old woman on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly.  “She was taken into custody and released the following evening having been given a penalty notice for disorder.”"
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/world/israel-syria-golan-mount-hermon/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Why Israel captured Syria’s tallest mountain just hours after Assad fell,"CNN —  Israel wasted no time after Bashar al-Assad’s fall to bomb all the Syrian military assets it wanted to keep out of the rebels’ hands – striking nearly 500 targets, destroying the navy, and taking out, it claims, 90% of Syria’s known surface-to-air missiles.  But it is Israel’s capture of Syria’s highest peak, the Mount Hermon summit, that may prove among the most lasting prizes – though officials have insisted that its occupation is temporary.  “This is the highest place in the region, looking upon Lebanon, upon Syria, Israel,” said Efraim Inbar, director of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS). “It’s strategically extremely important. There is no substitute for mountains.”  Israeli armored vehicles at the demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights. Matias Delacroix/AP  The summit of Mount Hermon lies in Syria, in a buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces for fifty years until last weekend, when Israeli troops took control of it. Until Sunday, the summit was demilitarized and patrolled by UN peacekeepers – their highest permanent position in the world.  Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, on Friday ordered the military to prepare for the harsh conditions of winter deployment. “Due to developments in Syria, it is of immense security importance to maintain our control over the summit of Mount Hermon,” he said in a statement.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has advanced beyond the summit, as far as Beqaasem, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Syrian capital, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. CNN could not independently confirm that claim. An Israeli military spokesperson this week denied that forces were “advancing toward” Damascus.  Israeli artillery on Mount Hermon in 1974. Alain Dejean/Sygma/Getty Images  Israel captured the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau in southwestern Syria that abuts Mount Hermon, in the 1967 war and has occupied it since. Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981. The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration.  Israel has for decades held some lower slopes of Mount Hermon, and even operates a ski resort there, but the peak remained in Syria proper.  “We have no intention to intervene in Syria’s internal affairs,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video days after Israel bombed hundreds of Syrian targets and seized the demilitarized buffer zone. “But we certainly intend to do everything necessary to take care of our security.”  Mount Hermon’s summit is a tremendous asset under Israel’s control. At 9,232 feet (2,814 meters), it is higher than any point in Syria or Israel, and second to only one peak in Lebanon.  “People sometimes say in the age of missiles, land is not important – it’s simply untrue,” Inbar said.  In an academic paper published in 2011, he wrote of the many advantages presented by Mount Hermon.  “It enables the use of electronic surveillance deep into Syrian territory, giving Israel early-warning capacity in case of an impending attack,” he wrote. Advanced technological alternatives like airborne surveillance, he argued, was simply not comparable. “In contrast to an installation on a mountain, these cannot carry heavy equipment such as big antennas, and they can be shot down by anti-air missiles.”  Israeli military forces on Mount Hermon on Sunday. Social Media  The peak is just over 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) from Damascus, which means that control of its Syrian foothills – also now in IDF hands – put the Syrian capital within range for artillery cannons.  The Israeli prime minister has said his “hand is extended” to the new government in Syria. But in the post-October 7 world, he and other national security heavyweights have made clear they are not going to take any chances.  “Mostly, it’s a comfort for us,” retired Brigadier General Israel Ziv said of Israel’s operations in Syria. “We have learned what happened in other countries when you have a terror organization that captures military equipment.”  Netanyahu has also insisted that the occupation is temporary. “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7 style attacks,” he said. His criteria for withdrawing, he said, was a Syrian force “that is committed to the 1974 agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed.”  It is unclear when that may be achieved.  Whether the military withdraws “is a political decision,” Inbar said. “The military would love to stay there.”  Mike Schwartz and Tim Lister contributed to this report."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/middleeast/can-islamist-rebels-govern-syria-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Can Syria’s Islamist rebels govern the country? Their rule in Idlib offers clues,"CNN —  When Syria’s rebel-appointed prime minister sat down with officials from the ousted Assad regime for the first time on Tuesday, the backdrop included the flag of the Syrian revolution alongside another bearing the Islamic declaration of faith that is often displayed by jihadists.  The choice of optics for the rebels’ first publicized cabinet meeting to discuss the transition of power since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime sparked controversy, with sceptics taking to social media to criticize the move.  The rebels may have taken note. In a later televised interview with Al Jazeera, caretaker Prime Minister Mohammad Al Bashir, who until this week ruled the small, conservative province of Idlib on the rebels’ behalf, appeared only with the new Syrian flag.  How the rebels governed Idlib, in northwest Syria, offers insight into how they might rule the country. Experts and residents of Idlib describe their governance as pragmatic and influenced by both internal and external pressure, with efforts to distance themselves from a jihadist past and gain international acceptance. However, their rule was far from democratic or liberal. Governing a large, diverse nation like Syria, they warn, will be an entirely different challenge.  Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that led the rebel offensive to topple the Assad regime and is proscribed as a terrorist organization by the United States, has opted to rule from the shadows. Jolani, who now uses his real name Ahmad al-Sharaa, picked a technocrat – Bashir – to lead Syria in the interim. He has said his officials gained valuable experience while governing Idlib but acknowledged that may not be enough.  “They (rebels) started from nothing, Idlib is small and without resources but thank God we were able to do really good things in the past… their experience is not zero and there are (areas) they were successful in,” Jolani told Mohammed Jalali, Assad’s prime minister, in a meeting on Monday to discuss the transfer of power. “However, we cannot do without the old (guard) and we have to benefit from them.”  Syrian caretaker Prime Minister Mohamed al-Bashir attends a meeting with the transitional cabinet after Syrian rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday. AL ARABIYA TV/Reuters  In just 13 days, Jolani’s ministers went from ruling the small province of Idlib to aspiring to govern Syria following its first regime change in six decades. Experts and residents who lived under the rebel-led Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) say the inexperienced cabinet will need to significantly adapt if they are to lead the transitional period effectively.  Dr. Walid Tamer, a resident of Idlib who witnessed the province’s transformation under rebel rule and said he personally interacted with Jolani, commended the SSG’s governance in Idlib, saying freedom of expression was protected. But he cautioned that the rebels aren’t prepared to rule the rest of the country.  “You went from governing Idlib to governing an entire nation… I don’t think the capabilities of the government we saw are enough for the task of governing the whole of Syria,” said Tamer, the head of northern Syria’s Free Doctors Union who describes himself as a liberal.  Idlib was “very safe” under the SSG, he said, adding that the rebels placed no restrictions on travel and movement inside the HTS-controlled province.  “Syria as a whole was a difficult place to live in, but the (SSG) never interfered in your personal life. Products were available and no limitations were imposed on your clothing or how you lived your life,” he said.  Life in the province was not one of prosperity, however. Abdel Latif Zakoor, a resident of Idlib who lived under rebel rule but has now moved to Turkey, told CNN the economic conditions under the SSG were “very difficult.”  “There wasn’t enough work, and a lot of people just stayed at home,” he said.  Taking control  When Jolani expanded his influence in Idlib in 2017, he eliminated rival Islamist groups and backed a new project to install a civilian government made up of local technocrats and academics, breaking from other jihadist methods that saw religious coercion under the rule of the sword in territories they captured.  “Before the Salvation Government you had many different factions that had their own courts of justice, prisons and social services,” Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst who has researched HTS for the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think tank, told CNN. “It imposed itself on other factions and took out their governing responsibilities.”  Displaced Syrians arrive from Lebanon to Idlib on October 10. In the center of the picture, the minister of interior in the Syrian Salvation Government, affiliated with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Muhammad Abd al-Rahman, appears as he inspects the registration procedures for displaced Syrians fleeing Lebanon. Ghaith Alsayed/Getty Images  Upon its establishment in 2017, the SSG issued a communique outlining four principles, one of which was that Islamic Sharia law is the “sole source of legislation,” emphasizing the need to “maintain the people’s Syrian and Islamic identity,” Al Jazeera reported.  The SSG operated as a functional government, holding publicized cabinet meetings with suited officials, issuing press statements and overseeing eleven ministries, including justice, sports, and education. It collected taxes, managed Idlib’s limited resources to govern 4 million people, and coordinated with international humanitarian groups to deliver aid to the 3 million displaced people in the region.  But the government wasn’t democratically elected, with ministers appointed through the approval of the shura, or consultative council, made up of prominent local figures, some of whom were selected by Jolani’s HTS. No women served in SSG leadership positions during its seven years of rule.  “It’s an Islamic governance in a technocratic way. What they wanted to do is control how religion is understood and how it’s implemented,” said Drevon.  A United Nations report from 2022 painted a grim picture of what life under HTS’ leadership was like.  “People were detained following comments made in private conversations pertaining to the cost of living or religious matters,” the UN Human Rights Council report on Syria said. “These comments were qualified as slander and blasphemy, with the latter leading to a sentence of one year of imprisonment.” Authorities “continued to arrest women for being ‘inappropriately’ dressed, and for non-compliance with entertainment-related bans.”  Tamer, who said he negotiated with HTS and SSG officials over medical matters, said that over the years, Jolani took a back seat in the daily affairs of the government and gave it more agency, only intervening on larger issues that endangered his group’s influence.  Rule by decree  Lacking a constitution or an elected legislature, the rebels ruled Idlib by decree, setting up a hybrid civil-Islamic court structure that included defense lawyers, a prosecutor and an appeals process.  Jolani was pragmatic in adapting to the requirements of the society he ruled over, Drevon said. Responding to the public’s displeasure, he slowly phased out the strict application of Islamic law, turned a blind eye to gender mixing and smoking and allowed protests against him. A Sharia law-based morality unit was disbanded but women were encouraged to cover their hair.  “It was a successful project in practice because there was also some buy in from the population. It was stable, the economy was working better (than the rest of Syria) and even the type of authoritarianism was nothing compared to Assad’s family,” Drevon said.  But there were exceptions. Last year, the SSG issued a “morality decree” instructing children to adhere to an Islamic dress code and limiting music in educational facilities. Jolani intervened to freeze the decree, fearing that an international uproar could affect aid donations, Drevon said.  Another issue was the arrest and alleged torture of dissidents that caused significant protests against Jolani in Idlib last year. Jolani told CNN last week that abuses in prisons “were not done under our orders or directions” and that HTS had already penalized the perpetrators.  Drevon said that Syria’s transition to democracy is going to be a lengthy and complicated process after six decades of dictatorship.  “It was a very new form of governance (in Idlib),” he said. “You can’t expect an armed group in war controlling a region that’s very tiny to create a social democratic system… They had to be realistic on what’s possible at war. Syria hasn’t had democracy in five, six decades. You will not become democratic in one week.”"

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/europe/lutsenko-ukraine-replaces-commander-russia-intl-latam/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Ukraine replaces commander following Russian advances on key city of Pokrovsk,"CNN —  The commander of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk group of forces has been replaced following Russian advances in the region, a military official said Saturday.  General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy would take over as head of the operational and tactical group, replacing General Oleksandr Lutsenko, the official told CNN.  The move comes after Lutsenko faced heavy criticism for failing to stop recent Russian advances on the key city of Pokrovsk.  Russian forces have been spotted just three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the city, according to Ukrainian mapping service DeepState.  Pokrovsk has been the site of some of the fiercest battles on the eastern front for months, as Russia attempts to close in on the city.  Lying around 11 miles from Ukraine’s Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, it is a strategic target for Moscow.  Its fall to Russian forces would mark the largest setback for Ukraine in months and compound Ukraine’s struggles to get off the backfoot while Russian troops pile severe pressure on the eastern front lines.  Losing it would also add to the anxiety Ukraine’s military faces over the looming Donald Trump presidency in the United States, which has raised the risk that military aid from Kyiv’s largest source could dry up as the grinding conflict approaches its fourth year.  Elsewhere in the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that Moscow’s forces had begun to deploy a “significant” number of North Korean soldiers in its effort to drive Ukraine’s army out of Russia’s Kursk region.  Ukraine launched an incursion into Kursk in August and still retains some settlements there.  “Today, there is already preliminary evidence that the Russians have begun to use soldiers from North Korea in assaults – a significant number of them,” Zelensky said.  “The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in the Kursk region,” Zelensky said, adding there had already been “noticeable” losses among these soldiers.  He added that Ukraine had information that North Korean soldiers may be being used along other parts of the front line."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/asia/south-korea-yoon-second-impeachment-hnk-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Business,South Korea’s parliament votes to impeach president over martial law debacle,"Seoul, South Korea CNN —  South Korea’s parliament voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday in an extraordinary rebuke that came about after his own ruling party turned on him following his refusal to resign over his short-lived martial law attempt.  It is the second time in less than a decade that a South Korean leader has faced impeachment proceedings in office and means Yoon is suspended from exercising his powers until the decision is finally adjudicated by the country’s Constitutional Court.  Following the vote, which sparked jubilation among protesters outside parliament, Yoon conceded that he will “stop temporarily for now, but the journey to the future that I’ve walked with the people for the past two years should not stop.”  “I will not give up,” he said in a statement shared by the country’s presidential office.  “With all the encouragement and support for me in mind, I will do my best until the last moment for the nation,” he added.  The country’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who will serve as acting president under South Korean law, told reporters that he would “devote all my strength and effort to stable operation of state affairs.”  Kang Sun-woo, a lawmaker with the Democratic Party, told CNN Saturday that the “great democracy of South Korea will survive and will be born again” after the impeachment.  The dramatic decision marks the culmination of a stunning political showdown after Yoon briefly declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers to parliament, where lawmakers fought past troops to enter the building and vote down the decree.  Yoon’s gamble backfired spectacularly, galvanizing many in the vibrant Asian democracy to call for his removal.  Opposition parties tried impeaching him a week ago – but Yoon survived after members of his ruling People Power Party boycotted the vote, saying they hoped the president would voluntarily resign instead.  Yoon then doubled down – giving a defiant speech on Thursday in which he defended his martial law decision, lambasted the opposition, claimed he was trying to save the country and vowed to “fight until the last moment with the people.”  Yet moments before that speech, the leader of Yoon’s party withdrew his support for the president and backed impeachment as the “only way… to defend democracy”, instructing lawmakers to vote with their conscience.  Thousands of protesters gathered in Seoul on Saturday, braving the cold to call for Yoon to resign ahead of the vote, which was passed by 204 lawmakers with 85 voting against it.  “He surely tried to have a war against the citizens so this is just what he deserved,” one protestor, Lim Dong Eon, told CNN outside the National Assembly building after the vote, where protesting has now turned into partying.  Another protestor kept their message short, telling CNN: “Democracy is back!”  Protesters participate in a rally calling for Yoon's impeachment in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14.

Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters  Meanwhile, thousands of the president’s supporters gathered in downtown Seoul, with many waving US and South Korean flags, chanting slogans and holding up signs in support of the embattled Yoon.  Yoon, who has been immediately suspended of his powers, now awaits a ruling by the Constitutional Court – one of the country’s highest courts – to confirm his fate, which can take up to six months.  Acting chief justice of the Constitutional Court, Moon Hyung-bae, said in a statement Saturday that a meeting will take place on Monday to discuss the case schedule, adding that the process will be conducted “swiftly and fairly.”  If confirmed, he will become the second South Korean president to be thrown out of office by impeachment after Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female leader.  The now acting president, Han Duck-soo, also faces his own political problems and is being investigated over his role in the martial law decision, adding to the political uncertainty in the weeks ahead.  A former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office, mired in low approval ratings and political scandals involving his wife and political appointments.  Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the Democratic Party, speaks during the plenary session for the impeachment vote at the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14 Woohae Cho/Pool/AFP/Getty Images  Since he took office in 2022 he has also faced political gridlock with an opposition-majority parliament – which prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill.  His administration cracked down what he referred to as “fake news” with police and prosecutors raiding multiple media outlets, including MBC and JTBC, as well as the homes of journalists.  Yoon argued that his frustration with the political deadlock drove him to take a bold power move, surprising not only members of his own party but also many military leaders.  Police raids and treason investigations  In his late-night address declaring martial law, Yoon accused the opposition of “anti-state” activities and being in cahoots with North Korea, without providing evidence – a charge his opponents have strenuously denied. He also portrayed his act as the only way to break the political deadlock in parliament.  But it was met with shock and anger across the country, which remains deeply scarred by the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it transitioned into hard-won democracy in the 1980s.  Dramatic scenes from that night showed security forces breaking through windows in the National Assembly to try and prevent lawmakers from gathering, and protesters confronting riot police.  Soldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on December 4, after Yoon's declaration of martial law. Jung Yeon-je/AFP/Getty Images  Since then, pressure on the president has grown, with police, parliament, prosecutors and the anti-corruption body launching separate investigations into Yoon on treason allegations. On Tuesday, lawmakers approved a special counsel to investigate whether Yoon committed insurrection and abused his power by issuing martial law.  The following day, South Korean police raided the presidential office, a presidential security official confirmed to CNN. Yoon has also been barred from leaving the country.  Last week, South Korean prosecutors detained former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who allegedly recommended the martial law imposition and resigned in the wake of the scandal. Kim attempted to end his own life in custody late Tuesday, according to the head of the country’s correctional service.  On Thursday, Yoon said he had only discussed the martial law decree with Kim before declaring it. Meanwhile parliament has already impeached both Yoon’s justice minister and his police chief.  Senior government officials have testified at various government hearings over the last week revealing some extraordinary details about the night of the martial law order.  Special Warfare Command Commander Kwak Jong-geun testified that he received a direct order from President Yoon to break the doors of the National Assembly and drag out the lawmakers, but he did not comply.  South Korea, one of East Asia’s most important economies and vital US regional ally, now faces months of protracted political uncertainty of the kind that dominated the country during the last impeachment crisis in 2016 and 2017.  Then-president Park Geun-hye was ultimately impeached by lawmakers over corruption allegations, kicked out of office by the Constitutional Court, jailed and later pardoned.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/entertainment/chappell-charli-sabrina-pop-cec/index.html,CNN,left,Business,"Pop music is messier, for the better, because of Chappell Roan, Charli XCX and Sabrina Carpenter","CNN —  This year brought us new albums from some of the biggest artists in the world: Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift all put out music that thrilled fans.  And yet some of the most impactful pop music of 2024 came not from Tay or Bey, but from three rising pop stars whose songs took us out to the clubs (Pink Pony and otherwise) and back home to the bedroom. They embraced romantic ugliness and cutting self-reflection — and pushed pop forward.  The year arguably belonged to Charli XCX, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter.  “People like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, who’ve dominated for so long — they have a sheen and a polish to them that’s somewhat unrelatable as a listener,” said Sam Murphy, a music curator who analyzes and dissects pop on his popular TikTok account. “What people really craved this year, the TikTok generation, was to see more mess and chaos in people’s lives. We wanted pop stars that we were able to see the flaws within and the charisma coming out.”  The year saw Charli, a boundary-pushing yet oft-overlooked pop veteran, finally escape what the New York Times once called “pop’s middle class” with her defiant, sweat-soaked, goopy-green opus, “Brat.”  This year, Carpenter went from a supporting act on the highest-grossing tour in history to a leading lady herself, with her endearingly silly, sexy songs topping the charts. (Here’s where she’d make a sex joke.)  And it was the year when everyone wanted to take things H-O-T T-O G-O, dance in the Pink Pony Club and wish their exes good luck, babe. Roan’s debut album came out over a year ago, but it rapidly grew an audience this year as she took her act on the road and won us over.  We loved this trio of stars because they weren’t impenetrable like Beyoncé or as towering as Swift. These artists were accessible to us, interacting with fans online and touring prolifically. Their music was personal and specific, with confessional lyrics about self-hatred, unrequited love and lust.  It helps, of course, that their music is exciting and compulsively listenable, said Mike Errico, a musician and visiting assistant arts professor at New York University’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, who teaches songwriting.  “The songs are great. They’re great writers and vocalists, and they’re working with great teams,” Errico said. “ But they also have something very urgent to say.”  None of these women became stars overnight — they’ve been recording music since they were teenagers, steadily building an audience who jibed with their unique sound. Their music doesn’t reinvent pop. But by adding their unique flavors to a well-trodden genre that’s been stuck in a rut of sameness, they’re forcing it into a looser, freer future.  “It’s been a while since there’s been a changing of the guards for people at the top,” Murphy said.  Fans want authenticity — and these artists delivered  Charli XCX belts at a Denmark music festival in July. Joseph Okpako/WireImage/Getty Images  There will always be room for artists like Swift, who’s “etched a place in history that can’t be erased,” Murphy said. But her titanic popularity has led to some “fatigue” among pop fans, he said.  “I think there’s a level of polish that is really reflective of a bygone era of pop that people aren’t relating to,” Murphy said.  Part of why Charli, Roan and Carpenter are so magnetic is because their music wasn’t made for everyone. They weren’t the biggest pop stars in the world when they were writing their breakthrough albums, so they weren’t beholden to an audience of millions. They’ve each cultivated a sound so specific that it can’t be mistaken for anything else.  “The ubiquitous, all-satisfying pop star has disappeared, and instead these niches are becoming bigger and bigger,” Murphy said. “I think that’s why it worked, that push that kept so much on that niche fanbase. It became so big to the point that it was able to start penetrating the mainstream conversation.”  Mainstream, indeed. Some of the biggest songs of the year were made by this pop trifecta. “Espresso,” especially, was inescapable, as Spotify’s most-streamed song globally with over 1.6 billion plays. “Good Luck, Babe!” also scored over one billion streams, and it was Roan’s only new single of the year.  The craving for authentic pop stars reminds Murphy of the “transition from Instagram to TikTok, where your Instagram feed was all about being polished and showing the incredible life that you were leading, even if things were really falling apart behind the scenes.”  On TikTok, meanwhile, users approach their content with inspiring candor, sharing their lives, warts and all, he said.  Charli, Roan and Carpenter take the same approach to their music. Their respective breakout albums, “Brat,” “The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess” and “Short n’ Sweet,” are all deeply personal, vibrant and, crucially, danceable records. That their voices or hearts might break along the way only adds to their considerable charms.  Works from established artists who have a quality and reputation to uphold, like Grande’s “Eternal Sunshine” or Lipa’s “Radical Optimism” — even “Cowboy Carter” and “The Tortured Poets Department,” which are both nominated for album of the year at the Grammys — ”all just got blown out of the water by these moments that felt more exciting,” Murphy said.  Live performances going viral helped artists like Chappell become stars  TikTok virality can turn a song into a hit, but it’s the art of performance that turns an artist into a star.  “I don’t think what happened to Chappell this year (would have) happened without her live stage presence,” Murphy said.  Roan cut her teeth on Olivia Rodrigo’s “Guts” tour earlier this year before joining the lineups of spring and summer musical festivals. We watched as her star rose steadily with every performance: In April, a clip of Roan performing the bridge of “Good Luck, Babe!” dressed in sleazy latex and leather at Coachella won new fans who went back and discovered her debut album. Four months later, at Lollapalooza, she played to the largest crowd in the festival’s history — organizers said as many as 110,000 people may’ve been in her audience.  Chappell Roan, pictured performing in Tennessee in October, had a busy touring schedule this year. With every tour stop, her audience grew. Jason Kempin/Getty Images  “We were watching that growth in real time, in tandem with incredible presentations of her music live,” Murphy said. “It’s difficult to imagine that kind of thing happening even five years ago, pre-pandemic.”  Carpenter’s trajectory was similar, supporting Swift on the Eras Tour before making some festival stops on her own and releasing the smash that introduced us all to the nonsensical phrase “that me espresso.”  These artists are meeting audiences where they’re at, which is, overwhelmingly, on TikTok. Charli and Chappell regularly connect with their fans on the platform, candidly delivering news directly to followers in a video instead of a manager-approved statement.  They also shirk the traditional promotional model of aiming for radio play to grow their fanbases, said music writer Reanna Cruz, who’s written for New York magazine, Rolling Stone and NPR. Now, radio is trying to play catch-up with the young fans it used to influence.  “We’re seeing younger artists that know how to access those hyper-online audiences more effectively have more success,” Cruz said.  We’re living the adjustment to mega-fame with the stars, too. Charli took a victory lap with the remix album “Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat,” on which she warped her original songs into meditations on sudden superstardom. Roan’s public grappling with invasions of privacy sparked conversations about how much stars owe their fans. And clips from Carpenter’s tour routinely go viral, most recently when Marcello Hernandez of “Saturday Night Live” stopped by, in character, as doctor-model-loverboy Domingo.  They have clear POVs that speaks to our time  Over the last decade, hip-hop has reigned as the most popular genre, Cruz and Murphy said, where innovation thrived and stars were reliably discovered. Until this year, pop, with a few exceptions, had been stuck in a rut.  The genre has been suffering from sameness throughout the back-half of the 2010s and into the 2020s, when many artists tried to appeal to all kinds of listeners without carving out their own recognizable sound. There was still room for breakouts like Lipa, Rodrigo and Billie Eilish, plus artists that blended pop and hip-hop, like Doja Cat and SZA, but pop was overwhelmingly plagued by monotony.  Enter Charli, Roan and Carpenter. While their sounds are clearly influenced by earlier acts — “Good Luck, Babe!” builds to a Kate Bush-style bridge; Carpenter’s latest album borrows from Shania Twain and Grande in parts; and Charli has mentioned electronic pioneers like Sophie and titans like Lou Reed and Daft Punk in “Brat” press — it’s their approach to the genre whose rules and boundaries are well-known that make them such exciting artists.  The artists make few compromises in their music. Charli’s beats are tailor-made for the club, with lyrics vacillating between braggadocious bombast to reflections on grief and insecurity. (“Nowadays I only eat at the good restaurants, but honestly I’m always thinkin’ ‘bout my weight,” she sings in “Rewind.”)  Roan’s campy, drag-inspired musical aesthetic has drawn more than a few comparisons to Lady Gaga’s similarly theatrical sound. It lends itself well to songs about hooking up with and falling hard for other women — still a rarity in mainstream pop. (“She did it right there, out on the deck — put her canine teeth in the side of my neck,” goes the first verse of “Red Wine Supernova.”)  Carpenter stuffs a dozen double entendres and innuendos into each deliriously raunchy song on “Short n’ Sweet.” And then sometimes, she drops the artifice and just says what she means: “I’m so f**king horny!” Here’s a pop star plainly confessing and celebrating her lust, something artists like Madonna were once lambasted for. Flirting with cheeky controversy, as with Madonna, has only boosted her profile.  Sabrina Carpenter, pictured at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, has won fans over with her retro pop sensibility and raunchy lyrics. Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty Images  Their music isn’t necessarily political, though Charli, who’s British, famously waded into the conversation when she posted, “kamala IS brat” shortly after the vice president’s candidacy in the US presidential election was announced. But the candid, confident music these pop stars make is meaningful during this turbulent moment, Errico said.  Songs like Charli’s “I think about it all the time,” in which the avowed party girl weighs motherhood, Roan’s various queer love songs and even Carpenter’s lusty, lightweight “Juno,” take on a new gravity at a time when, in the US, bodily autonomy for women and LGBTQ people is fraught and uncertain, Errico said.  “I think they’re sensing the clock turning back, and coming up with hooky, clever ways to say, ‘Over my dead body,’” Errico said. “They’re building a new army for a newly perilous time, while also having a blast.”  The future of pop, Murphy says, is tipping toward honest excess. We saw it this year with Charli transforming massive arenas into sweaty clubs, Roan painting herself with the patina of the Statue of Liberty, Carpenter enraging pearl-clutchers by striking provocative poses on tour. None of the over-the-top flourishes would work, though, without confessional bangers that both transport and ring true.  “People sometimes joke that we’re living in ‘the worst timeline,’ but these artists are determined to throw the best party anyone’s ever tried to shut down,” Errico said."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/federal-government-workers-what-matters/index.html,CNN,left,Business,How many people work for the federal government?,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.  CNN —  The US grew a lot in the past 40 years.  The US population expanded by about 100 million people  One of them was Vivek Ramaswamy, who was born in 1985 and is one of two wealthy men tasked by President-elect Donald Trump with shrinking the size of the federal government.  Government spending skyrocketed  The US spent around $900 billion in 1984 ($2.7 trillion in 2024 dollars), compared with more than $7 trillion in 2024. Some of that money goes via contracts to Elon Musk, the world’s richest man who is working with Ramaswamy on the Department of Government Efficiency, a new nongovernmental commission.  The national debt has more than exploded  It went from less than $1.6 trillion in 1984 ($4.8 trillion in 2024 dollars) to more than $35.5 trillion today, which should concern every American and is plenty of reason to make any effort to control federal spending a serious and bipartisan push.  Cut federal workers?  The current effort, run by Ramaswamy and Musk, has made a show of eyeing the size of the federal workforce. One percolating idea, according to CNN’s reporting, is that they could recommend firing every federal worker hired in the last year.  Hold on a sec  In those 40 years of explosive population, spending and debt growth, the size of the federal workforce – this is actually kind of shocking – has stayed pretty much the same, confounding the popular presumption that the number of federal workers must have skyrocketed with federal spending.  “The number of federal employees have skyrocketed over the past four years, especially the number that are working from home and not even coming to work,” the House Oversight Committee chairman, Rep. James Comer, told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Thursday, expressing that view.  A closer look at available data shows a variation of a few hundred thousand workers – which seems large but is not a grand expansion of the federal workforce.  Close to 3 million federal civilian workers for decades  There were about 2.96 million civilians, including postal workers, getting full-time paychecks from the federal government at the end of 1984, before Ramaswamy was born, and there are a hair over 3 million working for the federal government today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The official tally from the Office of Personnel Management is a smidge lower, at about 2.87 million, including postal workers.  In fact, the number of full-time federal workers has been relatively static, within a few hundred thousand civilians, since the 1960s.  Even a drawdown of the size of the military and Pentagon during the George H.W. Bush administration and of the federal workforce by hundreds of thousands during the Clinton administration did not markedly change the size of the federal workforce, which has hovered within a few hundred thousand of 3 million workers for decades.  Hundreds of thousands in, hundreds of thousands out every year  Of people who come into and go out of the federal workforce each year, there were hundreds of thousands of civilian employees (not counting postal workers) – about 250,000 to just over 300,000 – newly hired by the federal government in each of the past three years. Those are largely offset by the hundreds of thousands of civilian employees who leave the civil service each year.  Peter Morrissey is the senior director of talent and strategy at The Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for improvements to public service and commissioned a 2017 study to determine the true size of government.  “When you think about the long sweep of it, the number of public servants – people with a .gov email who work for the federal government – has been basically static as the responsibility sets have grown and grown and grown and grown and grown,” he told me. “They serve more people, and they do more stuff.”  Rising costs of social programs like Social Security and Medicare, along with rising costs of material goods, have helped drive government spending.  “People are an absolutely essential part, but in terms of the cost structure, are a comparatively small part,” he said.  In some agencies that Republicans have said they want to shutter, there are relatively few employees – such as the smallest Cabinet-level agency, the Department of Education. It employs about 4,400 employees, according to OPM. The largest federal agencies, like Veterans Affairs and the Pentagon, employ hundreds of thousands of workers.  Most federal workers are not in the DC area  Another thing to know about the federal workforce is that while its largest concentration is in the Washington, DC, metro area, the vast majority, 80%, is spread around the country in every state, but with concentrations in California, Texas, Colorado, Alabama and other states.  Concentrating on improving government might not mean shrinking it, according to Jenny Mattingley, vice president of government affairs at the Partnership for Public Service, which advocates for smarter government.  “What we keep trying to pivot the conversation to is say, let’s make sure we’re fixing government in a way that doesn’t hurt service delivery and doesn’t hurt the American public in terms of getting the things from agencies that they depend on,” she said.  ‘Giant holding company’  The government does indeed do many things. Elaine Kamarck is founding director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, and she helped spearhead an effort to reduce the size of government during the Clinton administration.  She told me it’s important not to view the US government as one monolithic thing, but rather as “essentially a giant holding company.”  “It’s doing everything from training pilots to fly advanced aircraft to tracking down cryptosporidium in your hamburger meat to cutting checks for retired people,” she said.  Firing only the most recent hires, as may be suggested by Musk and Ramaswamy, would have the added impact of scaring away future hires, as well as displacing people hired for specific roles, such as to implement the bipartisan infrastructure law passed during the Biden administration.  Once funded, agencies never go away  But Comer said people hired for specific roles and programs funded once have a tendency to stick around.  “The problem now in government, it’s been the problem for decades … is that you create a government program or create a government agency, it never goes away, even when it becomes obsolete or inefficient,” Comer told Brown on CNN.  The real deep state  On the one hand, the use of contractors and grant employees has risen as those workers, who don’t get a paycheck directly from the government but still do government work, have shouldered more of the burden.  John DiIulio, who worked in both the Barack Obama and George W. Bush administrations, wrote recently that the intersecting system of companies and local officials clamoring for federal dollars represents their own form of a deep state, and deconstructing it will be, he wrote, way harder than rocket science. Here’s an excerpt of what DiIulio wrote:  The citizens of the real deep state stoke nonstop federal deficit spending on everything from Medicare to missiles. They steer funding through intentionally maze-like federal programs. They use federal tax dollars to privately employ millions of people. They are behind the ‘waste, fraud, and abuse’ that everyone typically blames on ‘bureaucrats’ who are mostly mere grant and contract managers in a workforce that has not grown since the 1960s.  Musk, who has built companies on government contracts and subsidies, may be able to offer some insight into how the system works.  How many people actually work for the government, including contractors?  That review of “The True Size of Government” conducted for The Volcker Alliance by researcher Paul Light determined that in 1984, there were more than 6.9 million people working as civilians for the federal government when including contractors and grant employees. Add in the military and postal workers and the figure jumped to 9.8 million.  Intervening years saw a drawdown in the military after the Cold War and then a buildup during the Global War on terror. The study concluded with data from 2015, when there was a total of 9.1 million workers, or 7.3 million without the military or postal service.  Certainly the figure of contract and grant employees must have grown along with major spending bills in the past few years – with the infrastructure bill, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, which earmarked billions to transition the US to a greener economy. Comer said Musk and Ramaswamy, who will take a year and a half to make recommendations, could recommend trying to claw back unspent funds.  “There has been some pressure over years to not increase head count, and that usually leads to greater contracting,” Morrissey said, although there’s evidence that contractors frequently end up costing the government more money.  Everyone I talked to for this story agrees there is plenty of room for bipartisanship in a government efficiency effort to modernize the workforce and improve the way the federal government functions. Both Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Musk have talked about the need to control Pentagon spending, for instance. One complication for Musk will be that his firm SpaceX, in particular, is the recipient of billions in contracts."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process that would have the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items that may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/health/unitedhealth-children-autism-propublica/index.html,CNN,left,Business,UnitedHealth is strategically limiting access to critical treatment for kids with autism,"This story was originally published by ProPublica.  ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive its biggest stories as soon as they’re published.  There was a time when Sharelle Menard thought her son would never be able to speak. She couldn’t soothe Benji when he cried, couldn’t read him books he could follow, couldn’t take him out in public. “The screaming, and screaming, and screaming,” she said. “He would get so frustrated because he couldn’t communicate.”  Benji was nearly 3 when he was diagnosed with severe autism and soon after started a specialized therapy to help him develop basic skills. After two years in treatment, his murmuring gave way to small words, with “bubbles” among the first. To celebrate, Menard powered up a bubble machine she found at the dollar store, and for hours, they watched the iridescent orbs drift over their porch.  Menard, who is raising Benji alone in south-central Louisiana, began to picture a future for her son that diverged from the stories she’d heard about some kids with similar diagnoses, who grew up still unable to manage their frustrations and had to live in nursing homes or institutions.  But now, she’s worried again.  The insurer that has been paying for her son’s therapy, UnitedHealthcare, has begun — to the befuddlement of his clinical team — denying him the hours they say he requires to maintain his progress. Inside the insurance conglomerate, the nation’s largest and most profitable, the slashing of care to children like Benji does have a reason, though it has little to do with their needs. It is part of a secret internal cost-cutting campaign that targets a growing financial burden for the company: the treatment of thousands of children with autism across the country.  ProPublica has obtained what is effectively the company’s strategic playbook, developed by Optum, the division that manages mental health benefits for United. In internal reports, the company acknowledges that the therapy, called applied behavior analysis, is the “evidence-based gold standard treatment for those with medically necessary needs.” But the company’s costs have climbed as the number of children diagnosed with autism has ballooned; experts say greater awareness and improved screening have contributed to a fourfold increase in the past two decades — from 1 in 150 to 1 in 36.  So Optum is “pursuing market-specific action plans” to limit children’s access to the treatment, the reports said.  “Key opportunities” are outlined in bullets in the documents. While acknowledging some areas have “very long waitlists” for the therapy, the company said it aims to “prevent new providers from joining the network” and “terminate” existing ones, including “cost outliers.” If an insurer drops a provider from its network, patients may have to find a new clinician that accepts their insurance or pay up to tens of thousands of dollars a year out of pocket for the therapy. The company has calculated that, in some states, this reduction could impact more than two-fifths of its ABA therapy provider groups in network and up to 19% of its patients in therapy.  Internal company documents reveal the strategy by Optum, a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary, to prevent ABA providers from participating in its network. Obtained by ProPublica  The strategy targets kids covered through the company’s state-contracted Medicaid plans, funded by the government for the nation’s poorest and most vulnerable patients. To manage Medicaid benefits, states often pay private insurers a fixed amount of funds per patient, regardless of the frequency or intensity of services used. When companies spend less than the allotted payment, they are typically allowed to keep some or all of what remains, which federal investigators and experts acknowledge may be incentivizing insurers to limit care.  United administers Medicaid plans or benefits in about two dozen states and for more than 6 million people, including nearly 10,000 children with autism spectrum disorder. Optum expects to spend about $290 million for ABA therapy within its Medicaid plans this year, and it anticipates the need increasing, documents show. The number of its Medicaid patients accessing the specialized therapy has increased by about 20% over the past year, with expenses rising about $75 million year-on-year.  So Optum — whose parent company, UnitedHealth Group, earned $22 billion in net profits last year — is “heavily investing” in its plan to save millions by limiting access to such care.  In addition to culling providers from its network, the company is scrutinizing the medical necessity of the therapy for individual patients with “rigorous” clinical reviews, which can lead to denials of covered treatment. Optum has developed an “approach to authorizing less units than requested,” the records state.  Internal company documents reveal Optum is deploying “rigorous utilization management” in response to an increased need for ABA therapy. Obtained by ProPublica  Mental health and autism experts and advocates reviewed ProPublica’s findings and expressed outrage over the company’s strategy. Karen Fessel, whose Mental Health and Autism Insurance Project helps families access care, called the tactics “unconscionable and immoral.”  “They’re denying access to treatment and shrinking a network at a time when they clearly know that there is an urgent need,” she said.  United and Optum declined a request ProPublica made more than a month ago for an on-the-record interview about their coverage of behavioral health care. They have not answered questions emailed 11 days ago, citing the Dec. 4 killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO as the reason. In an email, a spokesperson said “we are in mourning” and could not engage with a “non-urgent story during this incredibly difficult moment in time.” Offered an additional day or two, the company would not agree to a deadline for comment.  Benji, who is now 10, requires 33 hours of weekly therapy to be able to progress, his therapists have concluded. They have documented the consequences of having even a few hours less: toppled furniture, scratched-up classroom aides, a kid in unremitting tears, unable to learn. But in a letter to Menard, Optum said it was refusing to pay for the full hours, stating that her son had been in therapy for too long and was not showing enough progress to ultimately graduate from it.  “Your child still has a lot of difficulty with all autism-related needs,” Optum wrote. “Your child still needs help, but it does not appear that your child will improve enough to end ABA.”  The response confounded experts who spoke with ProPublica, who said such an approach misunderstands the long-term nature of his condition. “Challenges that often come with autism shouldn’t be looked at like an injury that you’re going to get better from quickly and then the treatment can stop,” said Christa Stevens, who directs state government affairs for the advocacy group Autism Speaks. “Treatment may still be medically necessary even if it’s for skill maintenance or the prevention of regression.”  The company’s denial also appears to contrast with recent professional guidelines for the therapy — which are cited as a reference in Optum’s own clinical criteria — that state “there is no specific limit on the duration of a course of treatment.”  The appropriate duration of treatment, according to those standards and experts interviewed by ProPublica, should be based on the patients’ needs, as evaluated by the clinicians working directly with the patients.  “This is a very blunt instrument to chase after excessive costs,” said Tim Clement, the vice president of federal government affairs at the nonprofit group Mental Health America.  Several advocates told ProPublica the company’s strategy is legally questionable.  The federal mental health parity law requires insurers to provide the same access to mental health and physical care. As ProPublica recently reported, United has gotten in trouble in the past for targeting therapy coverage in a way that violates the law; while denying the allegations, it agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement. It continues to use arbitrary and one-size-fits-all thresholds to scrutinize its therapy claims, ProPublica previously found.  It would raise legal questions if the company restricted ABA more stringently than comparable physical care, the advocates said.  “Medicaid managed care organizations are subject to the parity act,” said Deborah Steinberg, a senior health policy attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Legal Action Center. The company may be violating Medicaid regulations, she said, which require managed care organizations to maintain networks sufficient to provide covered services to all enrollees.  Last year, the federal government formally affirmed that ABA therapy is a protected benefit, and it recently investigated health plans for entirely excluding its coverage; legislators have passed laws in every state requiring insurance companies to pay for it.  “Yes, this therapy can be expensive,” said Dan Unumb, an attorney and president of the Autism Legal Resource Center. “But solving the problem by denying kids access to medically necessary care is a terrible solution.”  ‘What happens if we withdraw the care?’  Benji dances with his behavior analyst, Whitney Newton, at Aspire Behavioral Health Center in Lafayette. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  Benji was making progress about three years ago.  For more than 33 hours a week in the specialized therapy, his clinicians broke down the learning process into basic steps, using repetition and positive reinforcement to affirm behaviors. The state’s Medicaid contractor, UnitedHealthcare, covered the bill.  Researchers have found that about a quarter of kids diagnosed with autism are severely affected; these children are often minimally or non-speaking or require extensive assistance for basic daily needs. “Things a lot of people take for granted,” said Menard. While experts continue to debate which therapies are most effective and appropriate for these kids, ABA is one of the most widely recommended.  By 7, Benji had accumulated a few dozen words, and his aggressive, prolonged tantrums had grown less frequent, allowing his mother to take him grocery shopping and to mass on Sundays. It was time for him to go to school, she thought.  Menard enrolled him in their public school district, St. Martin Parish. He attended Breaux Bridge Primary twice a week in a special education classroom and continued therapy the other days. Menard urged the district to allow a therapeutic technician to shadow him in school, but it refused. (The district declined to respond to ProPublica’s questions, citing privacy restrictions.)  With the diminished hours of treatment, Benji grew increasingly disruptive. “It was a disaster,” said Menard. He snapped a swing in gym class and struggled to sit still during lessons. When teachers tried to give him instructions, he hit them. His speech plateaued and eventually regressed.  Menard, who cleans pools for a living, grew to fear the moment her phone rang. School employees, unable to soothe Benji’s tantrums, frequently called her to take him home. One morning last spring, they told her Benji had lashed out when an aide tried to persuade him to work, aggressively poking their hand with a pencil. He hadn’t broken the skin, but after a dozen incidents, the situation was becoming unsalvageable. The district made her sign a behavioral contract, his second in two years: If Benji didn’t behave, he could be suspended or expelled.  Menard felt she had no choice but to withdraw Benji. She enrolled him full time in a home-study program run by his therapy group, Aspire Behavioral Health Center in Lafayette, which costs about $10,000 a year in tuition, a substantial portion of her paycheck. That was in addition to the therapy cost, which his insurance still covered.  Benji’s clinicians determined he needed direct support for most of the day and told Optum they wanted him to scale up his therapy from 24 hours a week to 33. They expected the insurer would approve the request; after all, it was less than what was previously covered and only nine hours more than it was currently paying for.  But Optum denied the increase in a letter to Menard this past May. “Your child has been in ABA for six years,” the insurer wrote. “After six years, more progress would be expected.”  The response disturbed Whitney Newton, Benji’s behavior analyst and a clinical director at Aspire; it didn’t seem rooted in the established medical standards for the treatment. She’d seen firsthand how critical the therapy had been to his growth. “We know what he needs. It’s in our scope of practice and it’s our right as the provider to determine that,” she said. “They’re cutting and denying an unethical amount.”  The center’s founder, psychologist Joslyn McCoy, has grown accustomed to battling insurers. Her practice serves about 160 patients between the ages of 2 and 19 across five centers, and many have Medicaid coverage. In 2022, Louisiana expanded its Medicaid parameters, allowing parents with higher incomes to access coverage for children with complex medical needs.  “What I’m seeing is that children now have this ticket to access this care, but then once they go to try to access it, it’s being denied,” she said.  Nearly two years ago, Optum selected her center for a payment integrity audit, demanding to inspect its clinical and billing records. After her team turned over thousands of pages of documentation, Optum conducted a separate in-person quality review.  Internal company records show Optum is targeting ABA providers for scrutiny based on how much they invoice and how many services they provide. Groups like McCoy’s can be flagged for patterns that providers told ProPublica are typical in the delivery of ABA therapy: billing on weekends or holidays, serving multiple family members in one practice, having long clinician or patient days, providing an “above average delivery” of services, or abruptly increasing or decreasing the number of patients or claims.  Internal company documents reveal Optum’s strategy for identifying ABA providers for scrutiny based on “outlier patterns.” Obtained by ProPublica  McCoy said that a company executive who visited her office for the quality review told her that she approved of the center’s work and thought Aspire should expand across the state.  But Optum has continued to challenge her patients’ individual therapy claims.  When her team received the denial for Benji’s care, McCoy set out to gather hard evidence to demonstrate the necessity of his treatment. “It’s what we call a reversal to baseline, where we will withdraw the treatment for a short period of time,” McCoy said. “The reason is to demonstrate what happens because we’re curious, too: What happens if we withdraw the care?”  Much of the therapy is driven by positive reinforcement; for example, if Benji pays attention and engages in his academic exercises, he can take a break to play on his iPad. But the reward is contingent on him not hitting anyone for at least 10 minutes at a time. During the experiment, the clinicians took away the possibility of his reward, and without an incentive, they had limited leverage to manage his behavior.  Joslyn McCoy, founder and director of Aspire Behavioral Health Center. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  At first, Benji lightly hit the staff, they said, as though testing the limits. But when there was no response to his behavior, it began to escalate. He tossed chairs and flipped tables. He pushed Newton into a bookshelf, which collapsed to the ground. He hit walls and windows, eventually turning his fists on his aide. They stopped the experiment early, both for his safety and theirs.  Once they resumed the interventions, Benji was able to calm down.  Newton drafted a report, including line charts that quantified his behavior with and without the interventions and photographs of her team’s injuries. She faxed it to Optum, asking the company to reconsider the denial.  The insurer did not change its decision.  ‘The need is not going away’  Last month, inside a cubicle decorated with posters of Minions and Mario Brothers, a behavior technician placed a laminated card with an image of a sneaker in front of Benji.  “What is this?” she asked him.  Benji paused, rubbing the edge of his baseball cap and pursing his lips. “Sh,” he said, stuck on the consonant.  “Shoes, that’s right,” the technician responded. She pulled out another card, showing a slice topped with white frosting. “Is this cake?”  “No,” Benji said.  “Is this cake?” she repeated, before adding, “yes.”  “Yes,” echoed Benji, but her correction appeared to frustrate him. He hit the technician on the leg, softly but with determination.  “We’ll let it go,” she warned with a sugared voice, “but hands to self, OK?”  Benji works with registered behavioral technician Hortencia Cervantez during ABA treatment. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  After 10 minutes, a timer beeped. It was time for Benji’s reward, getting to hear a reggaeton hit by Daddy Yankee. “It’s a big reinforcer here,” Newton said.  Even though Optum denied the additional hours of treatment, Benji has continued to receive them. “We’re giving the hours even if they were not approved,” McCoy said. “We don’t think it would be safe for him to do what the insurance is saying.”  Next month, a state administrative law judge will hear an appeal for the additional hours. If the request is approved, Benji’s clinicians will be paid for the six months of services that they’ve provided without reimbursement.  Even if that happens, their battle with the insurer will go back to square one. Each insurance authorization typically lasts for only six months, and soon after the hearing date, the clinicians will have to request coverage for his treatment again.  They will be doing so at a time when internal records show Optum has deployed more than 90 “care advocates” to question clinicians about the medical necessity of their patients’ ABA treatment, using “quality initiatives to decrease overutilization and cost.”  Optum is focusing on states whose Medicaid plans yield the highest costs for ABA therapy, including Arizona, Nebraska, Tennessee, Virginia, New Jersey, Indiana and Louisiana, where Menard and her son live. ProPublica reached out to the state Medicaid programs with questions about their oversight of United’s practices. Arizona’s Medicaid agency told ProPublica that all managed care organizations, including United, are required to provide timely services within their networks, and that the agency has been closely monitoring ABA networks. (Read its full response.) No other state Medicaid agencies responded to ProPublica’s questions.  Internal company documents reveal Optum’s strategy for managing its ABA coverage. Obtained by ProPublica  Autism experts said such a strategy may not only be harmful to children, it could also ultimately be more expensive for states, as children age and require more intensive services, like residential or nursing care.  “If these kids get the intervention they need as children, then there will be tremendous cost savings over the course of their lives,” said Lorri Unumb, an attorney and CEO of the Council of Autism Service Providers.  Menard worries about what will happen to her son’s hard-fought gains if he can’t get the level of therapy he needs. And even if the additional nine hours are approved, she fears that with the next authorization, they could face a more drastic denial that could be challenging to overturn.

She just hopes the therapy helps him to be better able to advocate for himself and, ultimately, be safe. “There’s nothing else that I’ve known to work,” she said.  McCoy resents being put in the position of scaling back care that her patient needs because an insurer is refusing to pay. “It puts us in a tough place, because we don’t want to discontinue therapy of our client who’s not ready,” she said.  When such denials become common, it disincentivizes clinicians from working with insurance companies, she said, and can ultimately drive clinics into the ground. “The patients can’t afford it,” she said, “so eventually the private provider goes out of business.”  But even if children like Benji get pushed out of treatment, there is no shortage of children seeking care. McCoy’s center currently has a waitlist of about 260 children.  That list may likely expand. Internal documents show Optum is aiming to exclude from its network about 40% of Louisiana groups that offer ABA therapy. About 1 in 5 children whose treatment is covered by the company’s Medicaid plan in the state could lose access to care.  “If the insurance company wants to deny all of our clients, we’re going to replace them,” she said. “The need is not going away.”"

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  Flybys of Jupiter’s fiery moon Io, carried out by NASA’s Juno spacecraft, are helping to solve the enduring mystery of why the small moon is the most volcanically active body in our solar system.  Similar in size to Earth’s moon, Io has an estimated 400 volcanoes that continuously release plumes and lava that coat that moon’s surface.  The Juno mission, which has been orbiting and observing Jupiter and its moons since July 2016, made incredibly close flybys of Io in December 2023 and February. The spacecraft zipped within 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) of the moon’s surface, capturing images and data. Together, Juno’s flybys have enabled an unprecedented look at the smoldering moon, including taking observations of its poles for the first time.  Researchers presented some of the results from an analysis of the flyby data Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in Washington, DC. A paper detailing some of the findings was also published Thursday in the journal Nature.  “Io is one of the most intriguing objects in the whole solar system,” said study coauthor Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator and an associate vice president at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “We can see that this body is completely covered with volcanoes over both poles and all across its middle, (which are) constantly going off.”  Volcanoes on the surface of Io erupt continuously, as depicted in this animation. NASA  The new data suggests that Io’s numerous volcanoes are each likely powered by their own chamber of hot magma, rather than being fed by a global ocean of magma beneath the surface. The latter had long been a prevailing hypothesis by astronomers.  The finding could change the way astronomers understand moons dominated by subsurface global oceans in our solar system, such as Jupiter’s moon Europa and planets beyond our solar system.  Spotting a cosmic pizza  Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, known as the father of modern astronomy, discovered Io on January 8, 1610.  But the moon’s wild volcanic activity wasn’t detected until Voyager 1 flew by Jupiter and its moons in 1979, revealing Io’s dynamic surface that resembled a pepperoni pizza, Bolton said.  NASA's Juno spacecraft captures the north polar region of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io on December 30, 2023. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS  That year, Linda Morabito, an imaging scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, became the first person to identify a volcanic plume as she studied an image of Io captured by Voyager 1.  The revelation sparked a decades-long mystery as astronomers wondered about the origins of Io’s constant volcanic activity.  “Since Morabito’s discovery, planetary scientists have wondered how the volcanoes were fed from the lava underneath the surface,” Bolton said. “Was there a shallow ocean of white-hot magma fueling the volcanoes, or was their source more localized? We knew data from Juno’s two very close flybys could give us some insights on how this tortured moon actually worked.”  This sequence of images taken by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2007 shows a giant plume from Io's Tvashtar volcano. NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute  Flyby revelations  Io orbits around Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, which Bolton calls a “monster.” The moon’s orbit is imperfect, meaning that sometimes it comes closer to Jupiter during its orbit, and other times it is farther away. Io completes one orbit around the planet every 42.5 hours.  Jupiter’s massive gravitational influence squeezes Io as it orbits the planet, like a hand squeezing a rubber ball, which warms up the moon. This phenomenon is called tidal flexing, or friction from tidal forces that generate internal heat.  “That’s what’s happening inside Io,” Bolton said. “That squeezing is generating heat, and it’s getting so hot that (Io’s) insides are literally melting and popping out. The eruptions are constant. It’s like a nonstop rainstorm. It’s just always erupting all over the place.”  Io is tiny in comparison with Jupiter, as seen in this animation, and the giant planet's gravitational forces cause the inhospitable conditions on the fiery moon. CNN/NASA  The constant flexing of Jupiter’s tug on Io generates immense energy, which would melt part of the moon’s interior, Bolton said. And if the melting was substantial enough, it would create a global magma ocean that Juno could use its instruments to detect.  During its close flybys, Juno captured high-precision Doppler data, which measured Io’s gravity by tracking how zipping closely to the moon affected the spacecraft’s acceleration. The data was compared with observations from previous missions that have flown by Jupiter and its moons, such as NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, as well as ground-based telescopes.  Together, the observations point to a rigid, mostly solid interior beneath Io’s surface, rather than a global magma ocean — solving a 45-year mystery started by Voyager 1’s observations. Instead, the volcanoes are powered by more local sources, and each one has its own pocket of magma beneath it.  “Juno’s discovery that tidal forces do not always create global magma oceans does more than prompt us to rethink what we know about Io’s interior,” said lead study author Ryan Park, a Juno co-investigator and supervisor of the Solar System Dynamics Group at JPL, in a statement. “It has implications for our understanding of other moons, such as (Saturn’s) Enceladus and Europa, and even exoplanets and super-Earths. Our new findings provide an opportunity to rethink what we know about planetary formation and evolution.”  The mission has also helped to capture an array of imagery that showcases Io’s “primordial fantasy land surface,” said Heidi Becker, a planetary scientist at JPL who was not involved in the study. The images are bringing different features on Io into focus like never before, including islands spotted on massive lava lakes, such as one called Loki Patera, which is so large that astronomers compare it more to a lava sea sitting on Io’s surface.  This animation shows the harsh features created by lava on the surface of Io. CNN/JPL  The Juno spacecraft continues to contribute new insights about Jupiter and its moons, having recently completed a flyby over Jupiter’s swirling cloud tops on November 24. Next, Juno will swing by 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers) above Jupiter’s center on December 27, logging 645.7 million miles (1.04 billion kilometers) since beginning its investigation of Jupiter eight years ago."
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/from-true-crimes-to-terror-when-is-dark-tourism-too-dark/index.html,CNN,left,Business,From true crimes to terror: When is ‘dark tourism’ too dark?,"CNN —  Fifty years ago, parishioners from Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple in San Francisco began to settle a rural commune in the South American country of Guyana. The Jonestown experiment ended four years later in one of the most tragic and bizarre murder-suicide incidents in American history. More than 900 people died on November 18, 1978, including a US congressman named Leo Ryan.  Now that Guyana is considering a proposal by a government-backed tour operator to open the now-overgrown compound to visitors, it raises a fascinating debate about the appeal, ethics and sensitivities of so-called “dark tourism” — the visiting of sites associated with tragedy.  Why are the locations of past atrocities, natural disasters, infamous deaths and incarcerations so popular with visitors? What does it say about us that we want to get close to these vortexes of disaster and evil? What obligations do governments have to give or deny access? Who gets to decide how history is presented to visitors? And what impact do such events and the subsequent visitors have on those who live near these spots?  There are no simple answers, but it’s important to explore the questions anyway.  Is it not simply history?  The welcome sign at the entrance of Jonestown, Guyana in 2022.

Design Pics Inc/Shutterstock dark tourism Prev Next  On my first cross-country trip, in college, my girlfriend and I stopped at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, the site of a battle in which nearly 200 died, including a former US congressman named Davy Crockett. Then a week later in Los Angeles, local relatives of mine took us on a driving tour that included the crime scene address of then-recently murdered Nicole Brown Simpson. The former visit felt like a US history lesson, the latter like morbid gawking. And somewhere in between is the subjective line that dark tourism dances around.  Dark tourism (also known as memorial tourism, or thanatourism, from the Greek “Thanatos” meaning death, or more derogatorily as morbid tourism, or grief tourism) comes in various shades.  Gettysburg was the single deadliest battle in the US Civil War, where 51,000 souls took their last breath, and yet where countless school field trips and, according to the National Park Service, 1.5 million visitors flock every year. Is that dark tourism? How about visiting the beaches in France where between 8,000 and 14,000 soldiers died in the D-Day invasions that turned the tide for Allies winning World War II? And what of Ground Zero and Flight 93 memorials for more than 3,000 who died on September 11, 2001?  I have toured Cambodia’s Killing Fields, with a survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide that left between 1.5 and 3 million murdered (in the four years following the Jonestown tragedy). Isn’t it important to visit atrocities such as that one, and former Nazi concentration camps?  The point of visiting these places is to feel uncomfortable, to bear witness, to share what you’ve seen and how it made you feel. Travel changes us, and sometimes because of exposure to the worst of human nature.  You’ve heard of the Disneyfication of places. Dark tourism is the opposite of that. These are the unhappiest places on earth. Yet they are places you should never forget. To go there honors the dead, their memory, their pain.  How far is too far?  There are examples when the line seems less clear, where bearing witness to past events feels more like slowing down to see the aftermath of a fatal car accident.  The first time I visited Savannah, Georgia I took a “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” tour. This was not long after the best-selling book of that name became a Hollywood film chronicling a real double murder that took place less than 10 years earlier. On the tour I kept thinking, “The people who live next door to these places may actually remember the victims, may have even been friends with them.”  People outside the Beverly Hills, California mansion where brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents in 1989 David Swanson/AFP/Getty Images  Just last month we reported on how the Los Angeles mansion where Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents has become the latest “dark tourism” hot spot. The brothers are back in the news and the subject of a recent documentary, but it’s hard to imagine what visitors are learning by simply staring at a crime scene. It reminded me of my Simpson murder scene visit, or the time I tried to find LA’s Cielo Drive, the site of the 1969 murders by the Manson “family.”  But how many degrees are those stops from touring Ford’s Theatre in Washington DC where a president was shot, or the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas from which another was? Is it ok to see thousands of Mount Vesuvius’ victims in Pompei, Italy because they were killed 2,000 years ago? How about going on an entertaining tour of Jack the Ripper’s victims in London from the late 1800s? Or paying a lot of money to go deep underwater for a view of the Titanic – where visitors themselves died last year while exploring a shipwreck where about 1,500 died just over 100 years ago? Does time desensitize us to these crimes and tragedies?  What is your intention?  In the early 2000s, while visiting friends living in Gloucester, Massachusetts, I felt an undertow pulling me toward the Crow’s Nest, the local bar made famous in a book by Sebastian Junger and the subsequent film of the same name, “The Perfect Storm.” They document the 1991 storm and final days of six fishermen from the small, tight knit community who frequented the Crow’s Nest.  On one visit I was walking along Gloucester’s small harbor when I saw a new ice cream shop had opened called The Perfect Scoop. I thought it rather distasteful, a description I’ve never before nor since used to describe ice cream, and it left me feeling embarrassed for having wanted to visit the Crow’s Nest. I decided to leave the salty bar to the locals.  The bookcase to the secret annex in the renovated Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Frank died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945 at the age of 15. Koen Van Weel/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock  But I’ve enjoyed the murder-heavy night tour of San Francisco’s Alcatraz prison island; walked through the “Bloody Sunday” neighborhood of Derry, Northern Ireland; visited Anne Frank’s home in Amsterdam and was equally moved by The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, inside the old Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. This summer I’m planning a family trip to Japan and added Hiroshima to the itinerary because I feel it’s important for my daughters to make a connection to the violence our country unleashed on another country, killing at least 66,000 in that city alone.  And I’ve long wanted to visit Jonestown. When I lived in San Francisco, just before seeing a show at the famous Fillmore auditorium, I popped around the corner to see the location of Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple, the last stop before Guyana. I feel drawn to follow that nightmare of a story into the real world, where it has been sitting in situ since the mass deaths. I want to talk to those who live nearby, understand the events more clearly, bear witness, go into the heart of darkness.  Perhaps the salient question to ask oneself before planning such a trip is: What is the intention? Is it to learn and understand? Or is it merely to scratch the itch of a morbid curiosity? Think about the locals, of the friends and family who are connected to the tragedy and ask whether visiting honors a legacy or exploits a tragedy. In the end, you may be the only one who can judge the ethics of visiting these places."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/politics/pelosi-hospital-injury/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Pelosi undergoes successful hip replacement surgery after fall on stairs in Luxembourg,"CNN —  Rep. Nancy Pelosi underwent a “successful” hip replacement surgery Saturday and is “well on the mend,” according to a spokesperson, one day after being hospitalized from an injury sustained during an official engagement in Luxembourg.  Pelosi was admitted to a hospital in Luxembourg as the result of a fall on the stairs, three sources told CNN. Pelosi’s office declined to comm﻿ent on how the California congresswoman was injured.  Pelosi, 84, is receiving “excellent care” from doctors and medical professionals, Ian Krager, the spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday.  The US military had medevaced the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. The medical center is a major military hospital that for years has treated US troops injured in combat.  “While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,” Krager said Friday.  Pelosi is “currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals. She continues to work and regrets that she is unable to attend the remainder of the CODEL engagements to honor the courage of our servicemembers during one of the greatest acts of American heroism in our nation’s history,” Krager said, adding that Pelosi “looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.”  The injury sustained by Pelosi came just days after longtime Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell tripped and fell at the US Capitol, spraining his wrist and cutting his face.  McConnell sustained a “minor cut to the face” and was “cleared to resume his schedule,” a spokesperson for the 82-year-old Kentucky Republican said in a statement Tuesday.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/entertainment/jay-z-lawsuit-response/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Jay-Z says inconsistencies in rape accuser’s story proves her attorney was looking for ‘money and fame’,"CNN —  Jay-Z is doubling down on his denial that he ever raped a teenage girl alongside Sean “Diddy” Combs, saying that newly revealed inconsistencies in her story prove that her account is not credible.  Earlier this week, an anonymous Jane Doe filed an amended complaint against Combs and Jay-Z, whose given name is Shawn Carter, which revealed that a previously unnamed celebrity in her original complaint against Combs, initially filed in October, was Carter. In the amended complaint, Carter is accused of raping the then-13-year-old Jane Doe at an afterparty for the MTV Video Music Awards in the year 2000.  The amended complaint made Carter the first celebrity to be accused of sexual assault in connection to Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to three federal charges and is awaiting a criminal trial.  In a new interview on Friday, the Jane Doe said she is standing by her rape accusation against Carter, but admits to inconsistencies in her original story, including key corroborating witnesses.  “I have made some mistakes,” the Jane Doe told NBC News. “You should always advocate for yourself and be a voice for yourself. You should never let what somebody else did ruin or run your life. I just hope I can give others the strength to come forward like I came forward.”  In her initial complaint, Jane Doe said that she asked her father to pick her up in 2000 after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Carter and Combs. But her father now said that he does not recall picking her up, according to NBC News, which also reported that Jane Doe said that she spoke to a celebrity the night she alleged she was raped, but that celebrity said they were not in New York at the time her allegations took place.  Jane Doe’s attorney, Tony Buzbee, said that he is still vetting his client’s claims, but is standing by her accusations.  “Our client remains fiercely adamant that what she has stated is true, to the best of her memory. We will continue to vet her claims and collect corroborating data to the extent it exists. Because we have interrogated her intensely, she has even agreed to submit to a polygraph. I’ve never had a client suggest that before,” Buzbee told CNN via email on Friday evening. “In any event, we always do our best to vet each claim made, just as we did in this case. This has been extremely distressing for her, to the point she has experienced seizures and had to seek medical treatment due to the stress.”  In a statement issued to CNN, Carter said that the woman’s inconsistencies “proves” that Buzbee “filed a false complaint against me in the pursuit of money and fame.”  “This incident didn’t happen and yet he filed it in court and doubled down in the press,” Carter’s statement continued. “True Justice is coming. We fight FROM victory, not FOR victory. This was over before it began. This 1-800 lawyer doesn’t realize it yet, but, soon.”  Carter’s attorney, Alex Spiro, told CNN: “It is stunning that a lawyer would not only file such a serious complaint without proper vetting, but would make things worse by further peddling this false story in the press. We are asking the Court to dismiss this frivolous case today, and will take up the matter of additional discipline for Mr. Buzbee and all the lawyers that filed the complaint.”  Spiro also filed a letter to the judge on Friday night, regarding the inconsistencies in Jane Doe’s account, calling her allegations a “sham.”  “Basic facts in her narrative – the who, what, when, and where – are wrong,” Spiro wrote to the judge. “When pressed, the Plaintiff admitted she was ‘guessing’ about key details… She admits she has no single corroborating witness over the last 24 years.”  Prior to Buzbee filing Jane Doe’s amended complaint in which Carter was named, Carter’s lawyers had filed an extortion suit against Buzbee, claiming that the Houston-based attorney was trying to “shakedown innocent celebrities, politicians, and businesspeople with an army of masked accusers.”  Lawyers for Combs, who has previously denied all civil allegations against him, criticized Buzbee in a statement to CNN.  “This is the beginning of the end of this shameful money grab.”"

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Downtown San Francisco experiences first tornado warning in recorded history,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said. Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and about 300 miles northwest of Sacramento."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/india/india-pollution-kids-health-hnk-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Delhi smog: Meet the kids struggling to breathe in India’s choked capital,"New Delhi CNN —  As pollution worsens in the Indian capital, parents are facing an impossible choice: stay or go.  Amrita Rosha, 45, is among those choosing to flee with her children. Both of them — Vanaaya, 4, and Abhiraj, 9 — suffer from respiratory problems due to rising pollution and need medication.  “We have no other option but to leave Delhi,” Rosha, a housewife who is married to a businessman, told CNN last month from her home in an affluent South Delhi neighborhood as she completed last-minute packing before leaving for the Gulf state of Oman.  Every year for the past decade, a blanket of smog has enveloped Delhi when winter approaches, turning day into night and disrupting the lives of millions of people. Some of them, particularly young children with less developed immune systems, are forced to seek medical care for breathing issues.  Rosha ensures her children get top health care — including doctors’ visits, steamers, inhalers and steroids — and trips outside Delhi to escape the choking air.  Amrita Rosha with her children Vanaaya, 4, and Abhiraj, 9, in her bungalow in South Delhi. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  While wealthy families like the Roshas can escape, it’s a different story for those without the means to leave.  About 15 miles away in a Delhi slum, Muskan, who goes by her first name, looks on with worry at the remaining medicine drops for her children’s nebulizer, a machine which turns liquid medication into fine mist to be inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece.  The mother rations its use because she struggles to afford more.  “We give half-half (of the dosage) of the medicines to our children,” she said, referring to Chahat, 3, and Diya, 1. They’ve been on nebulizers since each of their first winters, as early as they were born.  Muskan bought the $9 nebulizer after weeks of hard work on the streets. She makes a living picking up rags and other pieces of refuse, and her husband is a day laborer.  “When they cough, I feel scared that my children may die. I’m filled with regret, as I keep worrying about something awful happening to them,” she said.  Muskan holds her daughter Diya while while her 3-year-old son Chahat uses the nebulizer. “He thinks it is a toy,” she said as he puts it on himself with ease. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  Leaving Delhi  The suffering of Delhi’s children, year after year, has become impossible to ignore.  “Children are having to rely on steroids and inhalers to breathe … all of north India has been pushed into a medical emergency,” Delhi’s Chief Minister Atishi, who goes by her first name, said last month.  The Supreme Court has stepped in to monitor the measures introduced to curb pollution, which is generally caused by a combination of factors including vehicular emissions, crop burning and construction work, along with unfavorable meteorological and climatic conditions.  This has included banning cars, demolition and construction work, and spraying roads with water. Authorities have also increased public transport and cracked down on crop burning.  Despite these measures, Delhi has remained the most polluted city across India in November for eight years, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.  Manjinder Singh Randhawa, a doctor in the pediatric intensive care unit at the Rainbow Children’s Hospital, said this year he has been diagnosing younger children with asthma in “a very critical state” for the first time.  Video Ad Feedback India's toxic smog puts children at risk 02:54 - Source: CNN  In the long-term, pollution can have a serious impact on the respiratory, immune and cardiovascular systems, he added.  CNN has reached out for comment to the central and state government, and the Commission for Air Quality Management responsible for maintaining air quality in the region.  In some parts of Delhi last month, pollution levels exceeded 1,750 on the Air Quality Index, according to IQAir, which monitors global air pollution. Any reading above 300 is considered a health hazard.  During these weeks the pollution levels for PM 2.5, smaller particles which can penetrate deep into the lungs, spiked to more than 70 times the health limits set by the World Health Organization. It was over 20 times that level this week. Studies indicate that inhaling PM 2.5 can lead to cognitive impairment in children.  A costly escape  Some parents, like Deepthi Ramdas, prioritized their children’s health and relocated years ago. When her son Rudra was born three years ago, she did not think leaving Delhi would ever be on the cards. But that changed when she saw him admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in January 2022.  The doctors told her she should leave Delhi if she wanted her son’s lungs to develop, Deepthi recalled. Since she had family in the southern state of Kerala, she decided to go.  “It was not an easy decision. I had to quit my job which I loved… and because my husband had to continue to be in Delhi for work… we got into a long-distance marriage,” she said.  Deepthi Ramdas' son was hospitalized when he was less than a year old in 2022. “We keep this as a keepsake to remember one of his worst times yet,” she said. Deepthi Ramdas  But Deepthi finds relief in knowing Rudra has had no breathing issues in Kerala. They visited Delhi in the first week of December to meet their father. “We hoped since he is 3 now (that) his lungs would be stronger, but within a few days Rudra had an attack and was on nebulizers again,” Deepthi said.  “Looking at him like that was heartbreaking. There is no way I am moving back to Delhi,” she said, sharing pictures of Rudra from when he was in hospital in 2022 to him playing outdoors in Kerala in October.  Anxiety in the air  Many parents in Delhi are living under anxiety fueled by their inability to escape the city due to work and other commitments.  “This is not something you just do, you have to plan it, and be fortunate enough,” 29-year-old mother Urvee Parasramka told CNN. Her daughter Reva, 2, has been on nebulizers since her first winter, she said.  When Urvee was expecting, she recalls her husband, Prateek Tulsyan, responding to news of pollution by saying he’d ensure there were enough air purifiers at home to protect his child. However, nine months after delivery, Reva had her first attack.  “There was a lot of panic then. It was hard to understand why she even needed such heavy medication. I was very scared. It took me a while to come around,” Prateek told CNN.  Urvee added: “I am constantly checking her temperature, do not allow her to go out or eat anything that may exacerbate her condition. I am now an over-protective parent.”  If she hears Reva sneeze, she knows a cough is coming, followed by congestion and then the need for the nebulizer.  Urvee said they’ve decided to move to Guwahati, northeast India, where the air quality is better, during the high pollution months next year.  “I am born and brought up here, comfortable here, so to create another home there won’t be easy but we have no choice,” she said.  No way out  Muskan and her neighbors in the Delhi slum are not as fortunate.  She runs to the shared nebulizer when her children show symptoms like chest pain, coughing or vomiting. She says the children ask for it themselves and use it with practiced precision. But not everyone is able to afford to have the machine at home.  Some of her neighbors rush to the nearest private clinic and pay about 80 rupees or $1 for each treatment.  One of them is Deepak Kumar, a daily wage worker with four children. His youngest and only daughter, Kripa, 1, is using a nebulizer for the second consecutive winter season since her birth.  Deepak Kumar holds his daughter Kripa, 1, for whom he has had to take on debt to pay for urgent medical expenses. “If I put her down she starts crying,” he said. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  “The doctor asked us to buy it, but we do not have that kind of money,” he said.  One visit to the doctor costs more than his daily wage.  Nights are the worst. When there are no doctors available, he relies on balms and steam to help his daughter get through the night. Even when she is sleeping well, the mounting debt due to medical expenses keeps him awake.  “Yes, I am in debt of 20,000 rupees ($235) and to pay that off I am trying to work even harder,” he said.  Many like Kumar have come to Delhi from different parts of India to seek a better life, but they’re stuck.  “It should not be so hard to live in the capital,” he said."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/science/oldest-human-dna-neanderthal-ancestry/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Oldest human DNA helps pinpoint when early humans interbred with Neanderthals,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  Scientists say they have recovered the oldest known Homo sapiens DNA from human remains found in Europe, and the information is helping to reveal our species’ shared history with Neanderthals.  The ancient genomes sequenced from 13 bone fragments unearthed in a cave beneath a medieval castle in Ranis, Germany, belonged to six individuals, including a mother, daughter and distant cousins who lived in the region around 45,000 years ago, according to the study that published Thursday in the journal Nature.  The genomes carried evidence of Neanderthal ancestry. Researchers determined that the ancestors of those early humans who lived in Ranis and the surrounding area likely encountered and made babies with Neanderthals about 80 generations earlier, or 1,500 years earlier, although that interaction did not necessarily happen in the same place.  Scientists have known since the first Neanderthal genome was sequenced in 2010 that early humans interbred with Neanderthals, a bombshell revelation that bequeathed a genetic legacy still traceable in humans today.  However, exactly when, how often and where this critical and mysterious juncture in human history took place has been hard to pin down. Scientists have believed interspecies relations would have occurred somewhere in the Middle East as a wave of Homo sapiens left Africa and bumped into Neanderthals, who had lived across Eurasia for 250,000 years.  The cave where the ancient human remains were found is located beneath a castle in Ranis, Germany. Martin Schutt/picture alliance/Getty Images  A broader study on Neanderthal ancestry, published Thursday in the journal Science, that analyzed information from the genomes of 59 ancient humans and those of 275 living humans corroborated the more precise timeline, finding that the majority of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans can be attributed to a “single, shared extended period of gene flow.”  “We were far more similar than we were different,” Priya Moorjani, a senior author of the Science study and an assistant professor in the department of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, said at a news briefing.  “The differences that we imagined between these groups to be very big, actually, were very small, genetically speaking. They seem to have mixed with each other for a long period of time and were living side by side for a long period of time.”  The research pinpointed a pivotal period that began about 50,500 years ago and ended around 43,500 years ago — not long before the now extinct Neanderthals began to disappear from the archaeological record. Over this 7,000-year time frame, early humans encountered Neanderthals, had sex and gave birth to children on a fairly regular basis. The height of the activity was 47,000 years ago, the study suggested.  The research also showed how certain genetic variants inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors, which make up between 1% and 3% of our genomes today, varied over time. Some, such as those related to the immune system, were beneficial to humans as they lived through the last ice age, when temperatures were much cooler, and they continue to confer benefits today.  The two studies lend “substantial confidence” to the timing of when humans and Neanderthals exchanged genes, something geneticists describe as introgression, said evolutionary geneticist Tony Capra, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics in the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute at the University of California, San Francisco.  “Genetic data from this crucial period in our evolution are very rare,” said Capra, who wasn’t involved in the research, via email. “These studies underscore how having even a few ancient genomes provides powerful perspective that enabled the authors to refine our understanding of human migration and Neanderthal introgression.”  A skull found in Zlatý kůň in the Czech Republic contains DNA that linked the woman to the Ranis individuals. Marek Jantač  The scientists working on the two research projects decided to publish their work at the same time when they realized they had separately reached a similar conclusion.  How Neanderthal ancestry has shaped human genes  The research in Science found that genetic variants inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors are unevenly distributed across the human genome.  Some regions, which the scientists call “archaic deserts,” are devoid of Neanderthal genes. These deserts likely developed quickly after the two groups interbred, within 100 generations, perhaps because they resulted in birth defects or diseases that would have affected the survival chances of the offspring.  “It suggests that hybrid individuals who had Neanderthal DNA in these regions were substantially less fit, likely to due to severe disease, lethality, or infertility,” Capra said via email.  In particular, the X chromosome was a desert. Capra said the effects of Neanderthal variants that cause disease could be greater on the X chromosome, perhaps because it is present in two copies in females, but only present in one copy in males.  “The X chromosome also has many genes that are linked to male fertility when modified, so it has been proposed that some of this effect could have come from introgression leading to male hybrid sterility,” he said.  The Neanderthal gene variants detected most frequently in ancient and modern Homo sapiens genomes are related to traits and functions that included immune function, skin pigmentation and metabolism, with some increasing in frequency over time.  “Neanderthals were living outside Africa in harsh, ice age climates and were adapted to the climate and to the pathogens in these environments. When modern humans left Africa and interbred with Neanderthals, some individuals inherited Neanderthal genes that presumably allowed them to adapt and thrive better in the environment,” said Leonardo Iasi, co-lead author of the Science paper and a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.  The individuals living at Ranis had 2.9% Neanderthal ancestry, not dissimilar to most people today, the Nature study found.  The new timeline allows scientists to understand better when humans left Africa and migrated around the world. It suggested that the main wave of migration out of Africa was essentially done by 43,500 years ago because most humans outside Africa today have Neanderthal ancestry originating from this period, the Science study suggested.  However, there is still much scientists don’t know. It’s not clear why people in East Asia today have more Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans, or why Neanderthal genomes from this period show little evidence of Homo sapiens DNA.  While the genomes sequenced from the Ranis individuals are the oldest Homo sapiens ones, scientists have previously recovered and analyzed DNA from Neanderthal remains that date back 400,000 years.  Lost branch of the human family tree  The individuals who called the cave in Ranis home were among the first Homo sapiens to live in Europe.  These early Europeans numbered a few hundred and included a woman who lived 230 kilometers (143 miles) away in Zlatý kůň in the Czech Republic. DNA from her skull was sequenced in a previous study, and researchers involved in the Nature study were able to connect her to the Ranis individuals.  These individuals had dark skin, dark hair and brown eyes, according to the study, perhaps reflecting their relatively recent arrival from Africa. Scientists are continuing to study remains from the site to piece together their diet and how they lived.  The family group was part of a pioneer population that eventually died out, leaving no trace of ancestry in people alive today. Other lineages of ancient humans also went extinct around 40,000 years ago and disappeared just like the Neanderthals ultimately did, said Johannes Krause, director at the department of archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. These extinctions may suggest that Homo sapiens did not play a role in the demise of Homo neanderthalensis.  “It’s kind of interesting to see that human story is not always a story of success,” said Krause, a senior author of the Nature study."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/sport/lindsey-vonn-world-cup-skiing-return-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Lindsey Vonn to make World Cup skiing return in St. Moritz,"CNN —  Skiing great Lindsey Vonn has announced that she will make her World Cup return at St Moritz, Switzerland next weekend.  In a video posted by her sponsor, Red Bull, on Friday, the 40-year-old Vonn said: “So, I have some news. My body is finally put back together and I hear St Moritz is pretty nice this time of year.”  Vonn announced her retirement from competitive skiing in 2019 after 18 years on the World Cup circuit. In that time, she recorded 82 World Cup race wins, eight world championship medals and three Winter Olympic medals.  After undergoing successful partial knee replacement surgery earlier this year, the American star decided to return to ski racing.  “I feel stronger now than I did in my late 20s,” she said, per Reuters. “The passion for skiing has never gone away, I just wasn’t physically able to do it anymore.  “It was pretty soon after surgery and in the rehab process that I was already doing things that I hadn’t done in years,” she added.  “My body was just functioning better. Obviously, I am a lot happier because I’m not in pain 24 hours a day. I’m getting stronger and better and faster than I was for a long, long period of time.”  Vonn recently competed in lower-level events in Copper Mountain, Colorado in order to gain eligibility to compete at World Cup races.  According to The Associated Press, she will race in two super-G events in St. Moritz, where she has previously won five World Cup titles. The super-G competitions in the Swiss resort are scheduled to take place on December 21 and 22.  The US Ski Team confirmed to CNN that Vonn will compete in St. Moritz.  “One thing I realized is that life is really short,” Vonn said in the video posted by Red Bull. “If you have an opportunity, you have to take it. There’s nothing that I love more than ski racing.”  Vonn’s haul of 82 World Cup wins puts her third on the all-time list behind Sweden’s Ingemar Stenmark on 86 and compatriot Mikaela Shiffrin on 99."
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/christmas-railway-station-romance-chance-encounters/index.html,CNN,left,Business,Her flight was delayed and she missed her train home for Christmas. Then she met her future husband on the platform,"CNN —  When frazzled twentysomething traveler Jennea arrived at London’s King’s Cross railway station on December 15, 2013, the station was absolutely packed.  Carol singers in one corner were singing with gusto, collecting money for charity in brightly colored buckets. Gathered in the middle of the Victorian concourse, crowds of travelers stood, wrapped in coats and scarfs, looking up at the departure boards, waiting for their platform to be announced.  Passengers jostled past each other, armed with bags of gifts and large suitcases. Exhausted and a little overwhelmed, Jennea still found time to be charmed by the festive atmosphere. She took a moment to put down her heavy bag and check the departure board, searching for her train.  Jennea, who’d grown up in the US, had spent the last 18 months in Mozambique, where she’d been volunteering for the US Peace Corps. She hadn’t seen her loved ones in almost two years, and now she was en route to reunite with them in Cambridge, England.  The thought of hugging her mom, catching up with her aunt and uncle and distributing her gifts to her family kept Jennea going as she hoisted her heavy backpack onto her back, and headed towards her platform.  “I was absolutely loaded down — two suitcases, a backpackers’ backpack, my handbag…” Jennea tells CNN Travel today. “It’s Christmastime. I’m packed to the brim with Christmas presents. Making my way through King’s Cross Station, completely absorbed.”  When Jennea got to the platform, it was unnervingly empty. This was surprising.  “I remember thinking, ‘This platform is very quiet. It’s so close to Christmas and it’s King’s Cross, that’s bizarre. I don’t even know if I’m in the right place. What if I’ve misread the platform number incorrectly?’”  Jennea glanced around for someone to ask. She couldn’t see a train guard or another passenger.  “And not only that, there were two trains on the platform as well.”  It wasn’t clear which was the right train.  Jennea felt herself start to panic. She was already leaving London much later than she’d initially planned. And she was exhausted from traveling from the Mozambique village where she was volunteering to Malawi, then to Kenya, then to the UK.  “It took four days,” Jennea recalls. “And even then, when I finally landed in London, there was this massive delay on the airplane.  “Because of this, I had missed my plan A train, my plan B train, my plan everything train… It was 2013 and I didn’t have an iPhone yet. I couldn’t get a hold of my aunt and uncle who were going to be picking me up.”  Just as Jennea felt the stress and tiredness start to overwhelm her, she heard a voice behind her.  “Excuse me, is this the train to Cambridge?”  A train station conversation  Jennea and Arthur immediately hit it off at King's Cross railway station in December 2013. Dreamcapture Fotografie  Jennea turned around and saw a man, also wrapped in a hat and scarf, but significantly less weighed down by luggage.  “I was so relieved,” recalls Jennea. “I replied, ‘Oh I hope it’s going to Cambridge. That’s where I’m going.’”  As she spoke, Jennea realized she hadn’t had a conversation in four days — other than perfunctory airport and airplane interactions. She felt a strange feeling of ease with this stranger, who smiled at her and offered to help her with her bags as they boarded the train together.  As Jennea apologized for the heaviness of her luggage and the guy told her not to worry about it, Jennea thought she detected something familiar in his voice.  “Are you American?” she asked.  “No, I’m Dutch,” he said, smiling. “But I live in London. I’m Arthur.”  “I’m Jennea,” said Jennea, smiling back.  In mutual, unspoken agreement, Jennea and Arthur — who have requested their last names not be included in this story for privacy reasons — sat down on the train, opposite one another. They carried on talking.  “It was just very easy conversation,” recalls Jennea.  The carriage gradually filled up, and an overhead announcement confirmed the train was heading to Cambridge.  Arthur asked Jennea what brought her to the UK, and Jennea explained her mother was Irish, that she had family in Ireland and the UK, and they were all gathering there for the festive period.  As for Arthur, he explained he’d moved to London for college a few years previously. He was currently working in finance while he studied part time for a PhD — and he wasn’t heading to Cambridge for the holidays, but for something a little more unusual.  “I’d been invited to go to Cambridge by a friend of mine who was a novice monk,” Arthur tells CNN Travel today. “He basically invited me to spend a few days as a mini retreat away from the Big Smoke.”  Arthur had approached Jennea on the platform because he was confused about the train.  “It was initially purely functional dialogue,” is how Arthur puts it. “Trying to get on the train, trying to get to Cambridge… but then it quickly morphed into a very easygoing conversation about lots of different topics. It felt like there was a lot of common ground.”  “People say, ‘Was it love at first sight?’” says Jennea, of that first interaction with Arthur. “And I say this lovingly, but no, no, it wasn’t. It was just relief: ‘Thank God there’s someone else on the platform.’ And then it was functional. ‘Okay, where am I going? What am I doing?’ But then we sat down, and started talking.”  For both Arthur and Jennea, this conversation was the hook. They were intrigued by each other. Arthur knew nothing about the Peace Corps. Jennea was fascinated by the idea of having a friend who was a monk. Their conversation just flowed.  As the train — now full of people — weaved its way through the series of tunnels that carry trains northward out of King’s Cross, Arthur and Jennea kept talking.  “There wasn’t that point where it became awkward and silent and you’re thinking, ‘Do I dig out my book and pretend to read now?’” says Jennea. “No. We chatted the entire time.”  About an hour later, the train pulled into Cambridge station, and Arthur helped Jennea gather her many bags. They exchanged details, promising to add one another on Facebook, and they were still deep in conversation as the train pulled to a halt.  “Then, as we stepped off onto the platform, my aunt and my uncle were actually right there, and I was so relieved because they’d waited for me,” says Jennea. “I hadn’t seen my family in years at this point, it had been a long time, so I just threw my arms around my uncle, and then my aunt.”  Meanwhile Arthur hung back, still holding Jennea’s suitcases.  “He was standing there with my bags — my aunt said, ‘Oh my gosh, look at you. You’ve gone all the way to Mozambique, and you’ve come back, and here’s a man standing with your bags. What have you done?’” recalls Jennea, laughing.  “It was kind of an, ‘Alright, bye,’ moment,” says Arthur, also laughing.  Arthur and Jennea didn’t hug farewell — they both suddenly felt a little awkward in that moment. But as they walked in opposite directions, they each turned around to smile at one another, and wave.  “I was sort of thinking, ‘Oh, that was really nice. What a great start to my Christmas holidays,’” recalls Jennea. “But I had no idea what would happen next.”  Staying in touch  Arthur and Jennea had lots in common from the outset and stayed in touch after their railway meeting. Arthur and Jennea  When Jennea got to her aunt’s house, she spent the next couple of hours catching up with her family, sharing stories of her mammoth journey and her work in Mozambique.  Later, when she finally connected to the Wi-Fi on her cell phone, Jennea saw she had a friend request from Arthur. She accepted, and he sent through a message right away, saying how great it was to meet her.  “And then we just kept exchanging Facebook messages back and forth over the holidays,” says Jennea. “I kept sneaking away into the room I was staying at my aunt’s house to try and message privately.”  Jennea and Arthur picked back up the conversation they’d started on the train, sending instant messages regularly back and forth. After a couple of days, they started talking on the phone.  A few days before Christmas, Jennea’s parents arrived in Cambridge.  “As soon as my mom arrived, my aunt said, ‘I think she’s met someone in the UK.’ And my mom was like, ‘Who did she meet? She’s only just landed?’” recalls Jenna. “And so then I always had a — very well-meaning, but nosy — relative, always coming into the bedroom, just putting laundry away, whenever I was on the phone with Arthur.”  “Which I would hear in the background, by the way, when we would be talking,” adds Arthur. “I’d suddenly hear, ‘Can you see me? I’m the pretty aunt.’”  Jennea was set to return to Mozambique early in the new year. She still had another 12 months of her Peace Corps contract. It wasn’t obvious where this connection with Arthur would or could go. But then Arthur invited Jennea to visit him in London for a couple of days before she returned.  “My mom was like, ‘Absolutely not. He could be an axe murderer. You just don’t know,’” says Jennea. “While my aunt was saying, ‘You’re just young once, and you only live once, so take a chance and see what happens.’”  Jennea tried not to be swayed by either of their opinions.  “I mean, as an adult, I was able to make my own decisions,” she points out.  Jennea knew she wanted to see Arthur again. So she got the train back from Cambridge to London, where Arthur was waiting, smiling, in the station concourse.  “We were in London together for just 24 hours,” says Arthur. “It was quite special. We were able to squeeze basically lots of different dates into that period of time.”  It was the end of December — that time between Christmas and the new year when many people in the UK are off work, the Christmas lights are still twinkling and there’s a sense of expectation in the air as January 31 gets ever closer. It was the perfect backdrop for falling in love.  “It was a very magical day,” says Jennea. “We went to different restaurants, museums, and saw a show.”  Arthur had planned out the whole day.  “And all the things that he had planned, they were things that I really enjoy doing as well,” says Jennea. “So there was this thought of, ‘What you like doing is what I like doing,.’”  “It was just one day in London. But it really sealed the deal.”  Arthur felt the same way, saying this time together, “helped establish a strong bond.”  But when Jennea left for Mozambique, she and Arthur promised to take “everything one day at a time.”  Neither of them had been looking for romance when they met. And both were conscious that Jennea living on another continent would be tough to navigate.  “My approach to it was, ‘If I keep talking to Arthur, that’s wonderful, and that’s great. And if not, I had a great time. Everything was lovely,’” says Jennea.  “And so I think because I wasn’t expecting and hoping and putting that pressure on, it always remained a very safe space, if that makes sense — super organic. It was just very relaxed, one day at a time without the pressure and I think the distance permitted that — but also knowing that the distance was temporary, I think that’s a really important mixture in starting a long-distance relationship.”  Jennea and Arthur kept in touch while she was away via regular phone calls.  “We would call and chat, building the relationship and getting to know each other,” says Jennea. “I looked forward to those phone calls. We’d ask: ‘What are your hopes and dreams for the future? What’s your family like? Do you have siblings? Happiest memory…’ That kind of thing… And also just, ‘How do you like your toast?’”  “Jennea was someone that liked going into depth on different things,” says Arthur. “And also someone I could laugh with. Someone with a sense of humor. I think that was very appealing.”  A few months in, Arthur visited Jennea in Mozambique in spring 2015.  “It was surreal when I saw Arthur again,” recalls Jennea. “I couldn’t believe he traveled across the world to come and visit me. I traveled six hours via public transport to meet him at the Nampula airport so it’s safe to say we were both feeling a little more invested in our relationship at that point.”  Jennea waited for Arthur at the airport holding “a giant homemade welcome sign for him in Dutch.”  The Mozambique visit was really exciting for both Arthur and Jennea, and further confirmed their certainty in the relationship and its potential future.  “It gave me a deep appreciation for the volunteering Jennea did, which really was a defining experience for her,” says Arthur.  And as the months rolled on, Jennea started considering what she’d do after her Peace Corps contract ended. She was interested in teaching, but wasn’t sure where she’d end up based.  “My original plan was to return to the US and to go into graduate school. And in the United States, you have to take an entrance exam in order to get into graduate school. So I convinced myself that it would be worth it to go to London and take this exam, because then I could stay with Arthur,” says Jennea.  In the moment, Jennea told herself — and everyone else in her life — that she was saving money by not having to pay for hotel accommodation, even though she could have done the exam somewhere closer and saved the plane fare.  “It was an excuse,” Jennea says. “I wasn’t fooling anyone. But then I went to London and stayed with Arthur for two weeks.”  During that period, Jennea talked to Arthur about her graduate school plans, and interest in teaching, but mentioned nothing was set in stone.  “I’m open to various options,” she told him.  “Well, you know, London is an option,” said Arthur.  Jennea raised an eyebrow, not sure what to make of this.  “I remember thinking, ‘What does that mean? I’m fully aware that I could move to London, but are you asking me to live with you?’” she says today. “And yes, that was his very romantic way of saying, ‘Will you live with me? London’s an option.’”  Life in London  After Jennea introduced Arthur to her extended family during a Minnesota-based Thanksgiving at the end of 2014 — a trip she calls “a lot of fun” — she made the choice to move to the UK to be with Arthur.  This decision was made a little easier thanks to Jennea’s mother’s Irish roots.  “Fortunately, I have dual-citizenship with Ireland and the USA,” she says. “I was therefore spared any visa hardships, luckily.”  And at the beginning of 2015, she moved into Arthur’s apartment in Poplar, east London — which he’d just purchased.  “The wallpaper was a bit 1970s, so we had this shared project of updating this flat together, and I think for us living together for the first time in this big city, and adjusting, it was helpful, because I wasn’t moving into his space right away. We were both starting out in this new space,” Jennea says.  “We were building new memories together, in a new area,” adds Arthur.  Jennea and Arthur moved in together in London in 2015. MoMi Photo  The couple also adopted a cat from Battersea Cats and Dogs Home, an animal rescue center in London.  “That was also really nice, because we had our little friend, and it was nice to come home to him,” says Jennea, who started training to become an elementary school teacher not long after she moved to the UK.  Life in London was an adjustment from her time in the Peace Corps — and living in the UK was also different from Jennea’s childhood in the US. But her Cambridge family weren’t too far away. And Jennea was excited to create her own family unit with Arthur.  “We were just very easy together,” she says. “It just felt cozy. It felt like home when we were together. I found security.”  When Jennea moved to London, she and Arthur and just celebrated their one year “meet-a-versary,” as she calls it.  As a gift, Arthur gave Jennea a ceramic tile, a type of traditional Dutch pottery, with a personalized inscription: “A phrase in Dutch that translates to, “The measurement of love is love without measurement.”  Underneath the words was the date Arthur and Jennea first met: December 15, 2013.  Proposal and marriage  Jennea and Arthur on their wedding day in Curacao. Arthur calls the day ""incredible and very memorable."" Claudia Sanches/Wow Wedding Details  After a couple of years enjoying London life, Arthur proposed to Jennea while they were on vacation in Bruges, Belgium.  “Arthur proposed after giving me a heartfelt letter about his love for me and got down on one knee,” says Jennea.  In the spring of 2017, Jennea and Arthur got married in Curacao, a Dutch Caribbean island.  “We chose a place that inconvenienced guests equally,” jokes Jennea before adding that they were attracted to the beauty of the island, and the fact it was “neither a ‘his’ nor ‘hers’ wedding destination.”  It was, says Arthur, “incredible and very memorable — having all of our closest family and friends in Curacao for a four day party.”  “For the entire week, when we walked down the street we always bumped into friends or family,” recalls Jennea.  “The day itself was sunny, clear blue skies and warm. I had had a sleepover with the bridesmaids/girls the night before and I was ready to party and say yes to living the rest of my life with Arthur by my side. It was just such a great buzz.”  The speeches included a couple of mentions of Arthur and Jennea’s unlikely train station meeting — including three of Arthur’s friends performing a little skit about the meeting, and the couple’s life together since.  “I have a lot of happy memories of that day. It’s definitely a moment in time I like to relive and enjoy,” says Jennea.  Arthur says he also felt “deeply happy” and also really “grateful” to be marrying Jennea.  Tougher times  From the early days of their relationship, Arthur and Jennea had talked about wanting children. The couple first discussed this mutual desire on one of their many long, in-depth cross-continental phone calls.  They figured once they were married, and more settled with careers and life, they’d start trying for kids.  “But this turned out to be very difficult,” says Jennea. “We really struggled with infertility, and that was something that was really hard, because everything else was so easy between us. When we started trying for kids, it just kind of felt ‘What’s wrong?’ This life we had envisioned together — it wasn’t necessarily clear whether or not we would ever have that.”  As the uncertainty and heartbreak stretched over several years, Jennea and Arthur navigated the ups and downs as a team.  “We’d be open about the challenges, having those conversations emotionally,” says Arthur. “But then also not being stuck in that anxiety or concern or frustration, but trying to convert that into, ‘Where do we go from here, together?’”  Arthur also credits the couple’s “wider social circle, family and friends” who helped support them through this period.  And then, in 2020, Jennea and Arthur had a successful round of IVF, welcoming a daughter.  “We got very lucky,” says Jennea.  A few years later, in summer 2023, the couple had a second child, a son.  “We have another little baby, also with the help of IVF,” says Jennea. “We just feel very fortunate to have what we have now.”  Life today  Jennea, Arthur and their two kids now live in the Netherlands. Arthur and Jennea  Today, Jennea and Arthur live in the Hague, in the Netherlands, with their two young children. The couple moved to Arthur’s home country when they became parents.  This was partly a career decision after Britain left the European Union, and partly a personal decision.  “Arthur’s career was moved from London to Amsterdam following Brexit, and then Arthur’s family also lives here,” explains Jennea. “So as I was pregnant and about to give birth, the thought was, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be nice to be closer to Arthur’s immediate family?’”  Today, says Jennea, the couple are nostalgic about their London life — “all the museums, going for drinks with your friends — there’s just so much going on in London, how could you not love it?”  They always enjoy returning — especially to King’s Cross station, where it all began.  “Kings Cross station definitely holds a special place in our hearts,” says Jennea. “We always hold hands and kiss when we walk through together. When we brought our daughter there the first time, that was a magical moment. I’m looking forward to bringing our son there in the future.”  It’s that wonderful festive energy, the exciting chaos, that engulfs the days leading up to Christmas that I associate with our love story. Jennea  Over a decade later, Jennea says she still thinks “meeting at a train station is romantic. It feels nostalgic in a way, like an old movie meet-cute.”  Jennea and Arthur also always associate the month of December with their love story.  “It’s that wonderful festive energy, the exciting chaos, that engulfs the days leading up to Christmas that I associate with our love story,” she says.  The couple always take a moment to “set aside time to be with just each other at this point in the year, and tell each other just how grateful we are that we met,” adds Jennea.  “To our friends/family, it has been compared to a Bollywood scene,” says Arthur, who adds he has a strong feeling that bumping into Jennea that day was “meant to be.”  “I honestly still count myself incredibly lucky because it was so serendipitous,” agrees Jennea.  “If things had gone to ‘plan’ — no delayed plane or luggage, not having missed my original trains to Cambridge, etc. I never would have met Arthur. Our paths just wouldn’t have crossed. We were living in two totally different worlds and this really feels like it was fate. Eleven years later, we’re still together and with two kids, all due to a chance encounter on a train platform.”"

Here’s how to best view it,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  As the winter nights grow longer, those in the Northern Hemisphere will want to keep an eye out this weekend for the last full moon of the year. The silvery orb will shine bright in the sky for a hair more than 16 hours on Saturday evening into Sunday morning.  Known as the long night moon or the cold moon, it’s set to reach peak illumination at 4:02 a.m. ET Sunday, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. However, the moon will appear round to the naked eye for about three days, according to NASA.  For those in the Southern Hemisphere, which had a long visibility moon in June, the December full moon will appear for a shorter time and will follow a lower arch in the sky, said Sara Russell, research scientist and head of the Planetary Materials Group at London’s Natural History Museum.  “For those of us in the northern hemisphere, the Moon will seem to reach higher in the sky than you might expect,” Russell said in an email.  The sun, moon and Earth are on about the same plane, with the full moon occurring when Earth is between the moon and the sun as the moon orbits our planet. “In December, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, the Sun is low and has a short track across the sky, so the opposite Moon has a high and long track,” Russell added.  Observing the cold moon  The cold moon’s name is a nod to the bitter weather typically found in the Northern Hemisphere this time of year. The name comes from the Mohawk people, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac, which has names for each full moon that historically derive from Native Americans, Colonial Americans or other sources.  For best viewing of the cold moon, Russell recommended looking when it has just risen or is about to set to see it near the horizon. Wrap up in warm layers if you’re in colder weather and aim to look when there are clear skies in your area, she said.  “We are so lucky on Earth to have the Moon. There’s nowhere else in our Solar system where there is a planet and moon so proportionately close in size — the Moon is almost like our smaller twin,” Russell said. “It is better at preserving all of its history than is the surface of the Earth, and we can look up to its cratered surface to see how battered by impacts both the Moon and Earth have been over their 4.5 billion-year history.”  Those observing the moon can ponder the questions yet to be answered about the neighboring celestial object, such as the mysteries surrounding the far side of the moon, theories about the water-rich lunar poles or the possibility of humans one day living on permanent bases there, Russell said.  Upcoming celestial events  This year, the December full moon occurs one week before the winter solstice, an astronomical event caused by the Earth’s tilt, that marks the Northern Hemisphere’s longest night and shortest day and vice versa for the Southern Hemisphere.  This year’s winter solstice, when Earth’s axis is tilted the farthest away from the sun, will be at 4:21 a.m. ET December 21, according to EarthSky.  The next full moon will be the wolf moon on January 25, according to the Farmers’ Almanac.  Meanwhile, there are two meteor showers to close out the year; the Geminids will be seen blazing in the night sky until the shower’s finality on December 21, while the Ursids will peak December 21-22, according to the American Meteor Society."

Don’t cancel your flight just yet,"Editor’s note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.  CNN —  In travel news this week: the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards, why you shouldn’t gift-wrap methamphetamine, plus infrastructure megaprojects around the world.  Bridge and tunnel crowd  There’s been a whole bunch of international infrastructure projects in the news this week, with a strong focus on digging.  Busy beavers and merry moles have been chattering about resurfaced plans for a $20 trillion transatlantic tunnel that could theoretically link London and New York in just an hour using vacuum tube technology. That’s 3,000 miles of burrowing, mind, which Newsweek estimates could take the best part of a millennium if construction proceeded at the same rate as Europe’s Channel Tunnel.  In plans that are actually happening, Norway broke ground last month on its Rogfast project, which promises to be the world’s longest, deepest undersea road tunnel. Elsewhere in northern Europe, the world’s longest road and rail tunnel, the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel between Denmark and Germany, is slated to open in 2029.  Southern Europe isn’t shy of a project or two, either. Construction of a new bridge linking Greece and Turkey might be closer to getting underway, the Greek Reporter said Friday.  Over near the western end of Europe, the UK is busy building one of the world’s most expensive railway projects, known as HS2 (High Speed 2), which now costs an almighty $416 million per mile. However, many people think it’s pointless.  That comes a few years after the UK resurfaced plans for what would have been one of the world’s most ambitious bridges, linking Britain and Ireland. It was to cross just a 12-mile stretch, but the waters were deep enough to submerge the Eiffel Tower. Then there was the matter of all the radioactive waste and unexploded munitions. Unsurprisingly, plans were dropped.  Baggage blues  A top musician who played at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was forced to cancel a concert this week after Air Canada refused to give his multi-million-dollar cello a seat on the plane.  For others, the trouble only starts at the baggage carousel, although there’s progress on easing some of the pain of that. United Airlines has rolled out a new way to track lost luggage with AirTags, with users being able to share location information directly with the airline. Other carriers, including Delta, Lufthansa and Qantas, are set to follow suit.  Finally, Japan Airlines has announced a baggage delivery service for travelers that will allow luggage to be dropped off at customers’ hotels for a fee. The idea is to reduce overcrowding on Tokyo’s public transport.  Naughty or nice?  It’s always a bad idea to put wrapped Christmas presents in your airplane luggage – if they raise concerns with airport security, they’re likely to be unwrapped.  It’s an even worse idea when the “presents” are actually 10 kilos of methamphetamine, as happened at a New Zealand airport this week.  This Christmas, we hope that your holidays are not felonious, but felicitous — like American Jennea and Dutchman Arthur.  Jennea’s flight from Mozambique was delayed and she missed her train out of London to see her loved ones for Christmas. Then she met her future husband on the platform.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.  CNN —  “Even though you want to try to, never grow up,” Peter Pan said in the titular novel by J.M. Barrie, echoing a sentiment long expressed by the human race in an effort to cheat death.  The quest to unlock the secrets of longevity has been the topic of scientific study for decades. And some of the greatest lessons about living a long life come from nature itself.  Take Jonathan the giant tortoise, for instance. It is believed that the tortoise, a resident of the remote South Atlantic island of St. Helena, was likely born in 1832 — but he may be more than 200 years old since the exact date of his birth remains unknown.  Although blind and lacking a sense of smell, Jonathan still has sharp hearing for his advanced age and sunbathes during mild weather.  But even though giant tortoises are known for their exceptionally long lives, they may be outranked by an elusive creature of the deep.  Ocean secrets  A Greenland shark is seen swimming beneath the ice near northern Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. Avalon.red/Alamy Stock Photo  The rarely seen Greenland shark is a sluggish creature, slowly swimming through the deep waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The polar fish is the only species of shark that can withstand the freezing temperatures year-round.  The large sharks also live to be more than 400 years old, and some of them may have been alive since colonial times.  After mapping and studying their extraordinary genomes, scientists think the sharks’ unusually long lifespans are rooted in their unique genetic makeup — with insights that could be used to extend human lifespans.  Other worlds  The “Black Beauty” meteorite opened a window into studying ancient Mars when it was found in the Sahara Desert in 2011.  Astronomers believe the space rock was ejected from the Martian surface 5 million to 10 million years ago. And now, a single mineral grain inside the meteorite has revealed the oldest direct evidence of water on Mars 4.45 billion years ago.  The mineral grain was altered by hot water on Mars, which suggests that habitable environments such as hot springs may have existed on the red planet early in its history.  Meanwhile, the Perseverance rover just completed its 3 ½-month ascent up the steep rim of Jezero Crater on Mars, spotting an unusual zebra-striped rock along the way. Next up? The robotic explorer will investigate the oldest rocks on Mars to uncover more about the planet’s mysterious past.  Wild kingdom  A monarch butterfly drinks nectar from a flower in the pollinator habitat bed near the Chicago Park District storehouse in August. Tess Crowley/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images  With distinctive orange-and-black wings, monarch butterflies are easy to spot as they flit among the flowers, helping pollinate plants and encouraging biodiversity.  But monarch populations have seen a steep decline due to insecticides, habitat loss and the climate crisis — troubling enough that the US Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed adding the fragile species to the threatened species list.  If the butterflies receive the designation, more action could be taken to protect the important pollinators. But officials warn that without action, monarchs could vanish before the end of the century with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems.  Fantastic creatures  When a creature washed ashore in New Zealand in July, experts wondered whether it might be a spade-toothed whale, the world’s rarest whale that’s considered to be almost mythical because it has never been seen alive at sea.  Now, scientists studying the remains have confirmed the “really stocky, powerful-looking little animal” is indeed one of the elusive marine mammals, said Anton van Helden, an expert on some of the world’s rarest whales.  The carcass, studied by whale scientists and members of the local Māori community, yielded precious clues about the deep-sea-diving animal.  We are family  An illustration depicts early Europeans who lived in what's now Ranis, Germany, around 45,000 years ago and likely traveled together across the open steppe landscape. Tom Björklund/Max Planck Institute  Ancient DNA retrieved from bone fragments found in a cave beneath a medieval castle have helped scientists pinpoint when prehistoric humans encountered Neanderthals and made babies with them.  The bones belonged to a mother, daughter and distant cousins who lived in what’s now eastern Germany about 45,000 years ago. Their genomes revealed evidence of Neanderthal ancestry, meaning that early Homo sapiens living in the region mated with Neanderthals 1,500 years earlier.  “We were far more similar than we were different,” said Priya Moorjani, assistant professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley.  “They seem to have mixed with each other for a long period of time.”  In addition to shedding light on the shared history between humans and Neanderthals, the study also showed that the fragments belonged to a lost branch of the human family tree.

Police were called to a bar in Victoria in central London – a short walk from the palace – on Tuesday evening when a festive celebration turned violent.  A 24-year-old woman, who has not been identified, was arrested on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and of being drunk and disorderly, London’s Metropolitan Police told CNN.  The woman, who subsequently spent Tuesday night and much of the following day in a police cell, is believed to be a maid at the palace and was on a night out with around 50 members of palace staff at the time, according to The Sun newspaper.

She reportedly smashed some glasses and turned on a member of the bar staff.  Management at the royal residence say the matter is now being investigated and that disciplinary action could follow.  A palace spokesperson told the BBC: “We are aware of an incident outside the workplace involving a number of Household staff who had previously attended an early evening reception at the Palace.  “While this was an informal social gathering, not an official Palace Christmas party, the facts will be fully investigated, with a robust disciplinary process followed in relation to individual staff and appropriate action taken.”  The spokesperson told the BBC that the post-reception drinks, which staff went on to at the bar, were informal and had not been arranged by the palace.  A palace spokesperson confirmed the statement to CNN.  A spokesperson for London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed the incident to CNN in an email, saying: “At 21:21hrs on Tuesday, 10 December officers were called to a bar in Victoria Street, SW1 following reports that a customer had smashed glasses and attempted to assault a member of staff.  “Officers attended and arrested a 24-year-old woman on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly.  “She was taken into custody and released the following evening having been given a penalty notice for disorder.”"
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/world/israel-syria-golan-mount-hermon/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Why Israel captured Syria’s tallest mountain just hours after Assad fell,"CNN —  Israel wasted no time after Bashar al-Assad’s fall to bomb all the Syrian military assets it wanted to keep out of the rebels’ hands – striking nearly 500 targets, destroying the navy, and taking out, it claims, 90% of Syria’s known surface-to-air missiles.  But it is Israel’s capture of Syria’s highest peak, the Mount Hermon summit, that may prove among the most lasting prizes – though officials have insisted that its occupation is temporary.  “This is the highest place in the region, looking upon Lebanon, upon Syria, Israel,” said Efraim Inbar, director of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS). “It’s strategically extremely important. There is no substitute for mountains.”  Israeli armored vehicles at the demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights. Matias Delacroix/AP  The summit of Mount Hermon lies in Syria, in a buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces for fifty years until last weekend, when Israeli troops took control of it. Until Sunday, the summit was demilitarized and patrolled by UN peacekeepers – their highest permanent position in the world.  Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, on Friday ordered the military to prepare for the harsh conditions of winter deployment. “Due to developments in Syria, it is of immense security importance to maintain our control over the summit of Mount Hermon,” he said in a statement.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has advanced beyond the summit, as far as Beqaasem, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Syrian capital, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. CNN could not independently confirm that claim. An Israeli military spokesperson this week denied that forces were “advancing toward” Damascus.  Israeli artillery on Mount Hermon in 1974. Alain Dejean/Sygma/Getty Images  Israel captured the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau in southwestern Syria that abuts Mount Hermon, in the 1967 war and has occupied it since. Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981. The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration.  Israel has for decades held some lower slopes of Mount Hermon, and even operates a ski resort there, but the peak remained in Syria proper.  “We have no intention to intervene in Syria’s internal affairs,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video days after Israel bombed hundreds of Syrian targets and seized the demilitarized buffer zone. “But we certainly intend to do everything necessary to take care of our security.”  Mount Hermon’s summit is a tremendous asset under Israel’s control. At 9,232 feet (2,814 meters), it is higher than any point in Syria or Israel, and second to only one peak in Lebanon.  “People sometimes say in the age of missiles, land is not important – it’s simply untrue,” Inbar said.  In an academic paper published in 2011, he wrote of the many advantages presented by Mount Hermon.  “It enables the use of electronic surveillance deep into Syrian territory, giving Israel early-warning capacity in case of an impending attack,” he wrote. Advanced technological alternatives like airborne surveillance, he argued, was simply not comparable. “In contrast to an installation on a mountain, these cannot carry heavy equipment such as big antennas, and they can be shot down by anti-air missiles.”  Israeli military forces on Mount Hermon on Sunday. Social Media  The peak is just over 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) from Damascus, which means that control of its Syrian foothills – also now in IDF hands – put the Syrian capital within range for artillery cannons.  The Israeli prime minister has said his “hand is extended” to the new government in Syria. But in the post-October 7 world, he and other national security heavyweights have made clear they are not going to take any chances.  “Mostly, it’s a comfort for us,” retired Brigadier General Israel Ziv said of Israel’s operations in Syria. “We have learned what happened in other countries when you have a terror organization that captures military equipment.”  Netanyahu has also insisted that the occupation is temporary. “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7 style attacks,” he said. His criteria for withdrawing, he said, was a Syrian force “that is committed to the 1974 agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed.”  It is unclear when that may be achieved.  Whether the military withdraws “is a political decision,” Inbar said. “The military would love to stay there.”  Mike Schwartz and Tim Lister contributed to this report."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/middleeast/can-islamist-rebels-govern-syria-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Can Syria’s Islamist rebels govern the country? Their rule in Idlib offers clues,"CNN —  When Syria’s rebel-appointed prime minister sat down with officials from the ousted Assad regime for the first time on Tuesday, the backdrop included the flag of the Syrian revolution alongside another bearing the Islamic declaration of faith that is often displayed by jihadists.  The choice of optics for the rebels’ first publicized cabinet meeting to discuss the transition of power since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime sparked controversy, with sceptics taking to social media to criticize the move.  The rebels may have taken note. In a later televised interview with Al Jazeera, caretaker Prime Minister Mohammad Al Bashir, who until this week ruled the small, conservative province of Idlib on the rebels’ behalf, appeared only with the new Syrian flag.  How the rebels governed Idlib, in northwest Syria, offers insight into how they might rule the country. Experts and residents of Idlib describe their governance as pragmatic and influenced by both internal and external pressure, with efforts to distance themselves from a jihadist past and gain international acceptance. However, their rule was far from democratic or liberal. Governing a large, diverse nation like Syria, they warn, will be an entirely different challenge.  Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that led the rebel offensive to topple the Assad regime and is proscribed as a terrorist organization by the United States, has opted to rule from the shadows. Jolani, who now uses his real name Ahmad al-Sharaa, picked a technocrat – Bashir – to lead Syria in the interim. He has said his officials gained valuable experience while governing Idlib but acknowledged that may not be enough.  “They (rebels) started from nothing, Idlib is small and without resources but thank God we were able to do really good things in the past… their experience is not zero and there are (areas) they were successful in,” Jolani told Mohammed Jalali, Assad’s prime minister, in a meeting on Monday to discuss the transfer of power. “However, we cannot do without the old (guard) and we have to benefit from them.”  Syrian caretaker Prime Minister Mohamed al-Bashir attends a meeting with the transitional cabinet after Syrian rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday. AL ARABIYA TV/Reuters  In just 13 days, Jolani’s ministers went from ruling the small province of Idlib to aspiring to govern Syria following its first regime change in six decades. Experts and residents who lived under the rebel-led Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) say the inexperienced cabinet will need to significantly adapt if they are to lead the transitional period effectively.  Dr. Walid Tamer, a resident of Idlib who witnessed the province’s transformation under rebel rule and said he personally interacted with Jolani, commended the SSG’s governance in Idlib, saying freedom of expression was protected. But he cautioned that the rebels aren’t prepared to rule the rest of the country.  “You went from governing Idlib to governing an entire nation… I don’t think the capabilities of the government we saw are enough for the task of governing the whole of Syria,” said Tamer, the head of northern Syria’s Free Doctors Union who describes himself as a liberal.  Idlib was “very safe” under the SSG, he said, adding that the rebels placed no restrictions on travel and movement inside the HTS-controlled province.  “Syria as a whole was a difficult place to live in, but the (SSG) never interfered in your personal life. Products were available and no limitations were imposed on your clothing or how you lived your life,” he said.  Life in the province was not one of prosperity, however. Abdel Latif Zakoor, a resident of Idlib who lived under rebel rule but has now moved to Turkey, told CNN the economic conditions under the SSG were “very difficult.”  “There wasn’t enough work, and a lot of people just stayed at home,” he said.  Taking control  When Jolani expanded his influence in Idlib in 2017, he eliminated rival Islamist groups and backed a new project to install a civilian government made up of local technocrats and academics, breaking from other jihadist methods that saw religious coercion under the rule of the sword in territories they captured.  “Before the Salvation Government you had many different factions that had their own courts of justice, prisons and social services,” Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst who has researched HTS for the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think tank, told CNN. “It imposed itself on other factions and took out their governing responsibilities.”  Displaced Syrians arrive from Lebanon to Idlib on October 10. In the center of the picture, the minister of interior in the Syrian Salvation Government, affiliated with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Muhammad Abd al-Rahman, appears as he inspects the registration procedures for displaced Syrians fleeing Lebanon. Ghaith Alsayed/Getty Images  Upon its establishment in 2017, the SSG issued a communique outlining four principles, one of which was that Islamic Sharia law is the “sole source of legislation,” emphasizing the need to “maintain the people’s Syrian and Islamic identity,” Al Jazeera reported.  The SSG operated as a functional government, holding publicized cabinet meetings with suited officials, issuing press statements and overseeing eleven ministries, including justice, sports, and education. It collected taxes, managed Idlib’s limited resources to govern 4 million people, and coordinated with international humanitarian groups to deliver aid to the 3 million displaced people in the region.  But the government wasn’t democratically elected, with ministers appointed through the approval of the shura, or consultative council, made up of prominent local figures, some of whom were selected by Jolani’s HTS. No women served in SSG leadership positions during its seven years of rule.  “It’s an Islamic governance in a technocratic way. What they wanted to do is control how religion is understood and how it’s implemented,” said Drevon.  A United Nations report from 2022 painted a grim picture of what life under HTS’ leadership was like.  “People were detained following comments made in private conversations pertaining to the cost of living or religious matters,” the UN Human Rights Council report on Syria said. “These comments were qualified as slander and blasphemy, with the latter leading to a sentence of one year of imprisonment.” Authorities “continued to arrest women for being ‘inappropriately’ dressed, and for non-compliance with entertainment-related bans.”  Tamer, who said he negotiated with HTS and SSG officials over medical matters, said that over the years, Jolani took a back seat in the daily affairs of the government and gave it more agency, only intervening on larger issues that endangered his group’s influence.  Rule by decree  Lacking a constitution or an elected legislature, the rebels ruled Idlib by decree, setting up a hybrid civil-Islamic court structure that included defense lawyers, a prosecutor and an appeals process.  Jolani was pragmatic in adapting to the requirements of the society he ruled over, Drevon said. Responding to the public’s displeasure, he slowly phased out the strict application of Islamic law, turned a blind eye to gender mixing and smoking and allowed protests against him. A Sharia law-based morality unit was disbanded but women were encouraged to cover their hair.  “It was a successful project in practice because there was also some buy in from the population. It was stable, the economy was working better (than the rest of Syria) and even the type of authoritarianism was nothing compared to Assad’s family,” Drevon said.  But there were exceptions. Last year, the SSG issued a “morality decree” instructing children to adhere to an Islamic dress code and limiting music in educational facilities. Jolani intervened to freeze the decree, fearing that an international uproar could affect aid donations, Drevon said.  Another issue was the arrest and alleged torture of dissidents that caused significant protests against Jolani in Idlib last year. Jolani told CNN last week that abuses in prisons “were not done under our orders or directions” and that HTS had already penalized the perpetrators.  Drevon said that Syria’s transition to democracy is going to be a lengthy and complicated process after six decades of dictatorship.  “It was a very new form of governance (in Idlib),” he said. “You can’t expect an armed group in war controlling a region that’s very tiny to create a social democratic system… They had to be realistic on what’s possible at war. Syria hasn’t had democracy in five, six decades. You will not become democratic in one week.”"

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/europe/lutsenko-ukraine-replaces-commander-russia-intl-latam/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Ukraine replaces commander following Russian advances on key city of Pokrovsk,"CNN —  The commander of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk group of forces has been replaced following Russian advances in the region, a military official said Saturday.  General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy would take over as head of the operational and tactical group, replacing General Oleksandr Lutsenko, the official told CNN.  The move comes after Lutsenko faced heavy criticism for failing to stop recent Russian advances on the key city of Pokrovsk.  Russian forces have been spotted just three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the city, according to Ukrainian mapping service DeepState.  Pokrovsk has been the site of some of the fiercest battles on the eastern front for months, as Russia attempts to close in on the city.  Lying around 11 miles from Ukraine’s Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, it is a strategic target for Moscow.  Its fall to Russian forces would mark the largest setback for Ukraine in months and compound Ukraine’s struggles to get off the backfoot while Russian troops pile severe pressure on the eastern front lines.  Losing it would also add to the anxiety Ukraine’s military faces over the looming Donald Trump presidency in the United States, which has raised the risk that military aid from Kyiv’s largest source could dry up as the grinding conflict approaches its fourth year.  Elsewhere in the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that Moscow’s forces had begun to deploy a “significant” number of North Korean soldiers in its effort to drive Ukraine’s army out of Russia’s Kursk region.  Ukraine launched an incursion into Kursk in August and still retains some settlements there.  “Today, there is already preliminary evidence that the Russians have begun to use soldiers from North Korea in assaults – a significant number of them,” Zelensky said.  “The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in the Kursk region,” Zelensky said, adding there had already been “noticeable” losses among these soldiers.  He added that Ukraine had information that North Korean soldiers may be being used along other parts of the front line."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/asia/south-korea-yoon-second-impeachment-hnk-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,South Korea’s parliament votes to impeach president over martial law debacle,"Seoul, South Korea CNN —  South Korea’s parliament voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday in an extraordinary rebuke that came about after his own ruling party turned on him following his refusal to resign over his short-lived martial law attempt.  It is the second time in less than a decade that a South Korean leader has faced impeachment proceedings in office and means Yoon is suspended from exercising his powers until the decision is finally adjudicated by the country’s Constitutional Court.  Following the vote, which sparked jubilation among protesters outside parliament, Yoon conceded that he will “stop temporarily for now, but the journey to the future that I’ve walked with the people for the past two years should not stop.”  “I will not give up,” he said in a statement shared by the country’s presidential office.  “With all the encouragement and support for me in mind, I will do my best until the last moment for the nation,” he added.  The country’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who will serve as acting president under South Korean law, told reporters that he would “devote all my strength and effort to stable operation of state affairs.”  Kang Sun-woo, a lawmaker with the Democratic Party, told CNN Saturday that the “great democracy of South Korea will survive and will be born again” after the impeachment.  The dramatic decision marks the culmination of a stunning political showdown after Yoon briefly declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers to parliament, where lawmakers fought past troops to enter the building and vote down the decree.  Yoon’s gamble backfired spectacularly, galvanizing many in the vibrant Asian democracy to call for his removal.  Opposition parties tried impeaching him a week ago – but Yoon survived after members of his ruling People Power Party boycotted the vote, saying they hoped the president would voluntarily resign instead.  Yoon then doubled down – giving a defiant speech on Thursday in which he defended his martial law decision, lambasted the opposition, claimed he was trying to save the country and vowed to “fight until the last moment with the people.”  Yet moments before that speech, the leader of Yoon’s party withdrew his support for the president and backed impeachment as the “only way… to defend democracy”, instructing lawmakers to vote with their conscience.  Thousands of protesters gathered in Seoul on Saturday, braving the cold to call for Yoon to resign ahead of the vote, which was passed by 204 lawmakers with 85 voting against it.  “He surely tried to have a war against the citizens so this is just what he deserved,” one protestor, Lim Dong Eon, told CNN outside the National Assembly building after the vote, where protesting has now turned into partying.  Another protestor kept their message short, telling CNN: “Democracy is back!”  Protesters participate in a rally calling for Yoon's impeachment in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14. Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters  People celebrate after the South Korean parliament passed an impeachment motion against Yoon on December 14. Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters  Meanwhile, thousands of the president’s supporters gathered in downtown Seoul, with many waving US and South Korean flags, chanting slogans and holding up signs in support of the embattled Yoon.  Yoon, who has been immediately suspended of his powers, now awaits a ruling by the Constitutional Court – one of the country’s highest courts – to confirm his fate, which can take up to six months.  Acting chief justice of the Constitutional Court, Moon Hyung-bae, said in a statement Saturday that a meeting will take place on Monday to discuss the case schedule, adding that the process will be conducted “swiftly and fairly.”  If confirmed, he will become the second South Korean president to be thrown out of office by impeachment after Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female leader.  The now acting president, Han Duck-soo, also faces his own political problems and is being investigated over his role in the martial law decision, adding to the political uncertainty in the weeks ahead.  A former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office, mired in low approval ratings and political scandals involving his wife and political appointments.  Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the Democratic Party, speaks during the plenary session for the impeachment vote at the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14 Woohae Cho/Pool/AFP/Getty Images  Since he took office in 2022 he has also faced political gridlock with an opposition-majority parliament – which prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill.  His administration cracked down what he referred to as “fake news” with police and prosecutors raiding multiple media outlets, including MBC and JTBC, as well as the homes of journalists.  Yoon argued that his frustration with the political deadlock drove him to take a bold power move, surprising not only members of his own party but also many military leaders.  Police raids and treason investigations  In his late-night address declaring martial law, Yoon accused the opposition of “anti-state” activities and being in cahoots with North Korea, without providing evidence – a charge his opponents have strenuously denied. He also portrayed his act as the only way to break the political deadlock in parliament.  But it was met with shock and anger across the country, which remains deeply scarred by the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it transitioned into hard-won democracy in the 1980s.  Dramatic scenes from that night showed security forces breaking through windows in the National Assembly to try and prevent lawmakers from gathering, and protesters confronting riot police.

Jung Yeon-je/AFP/Getty Images  Since then, pressure on the president has grown, with police, parliament, prosecutors and the anti-corruption body launching separate investigations into Yoon on treason allegations. On Tuesday, lawmakers approved a special counsel to investigate whether Yoon committed insurrection and abused his power by issuing martial law.  The following day, South Korean police raided the presidential office, a presidential security official confirmed to CNN. Yoon has also been barred from leaving the country.  Last week, South Korean prosecutors detained former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who allegedly recommended the martial law imposition and resigned in the wake of the scandal. Kim attempted to end his own life in custody late Tuesday, according to the head of the country’s correctional service.  On Thursday, Yoon said he had only discussed the martial law decree with Kim before declaring it. Meanwhile parliament has already impeached both Yoon’s justice minister and his police chief.  Senior government officials have testified at various government hearings over the last week revealing some extraordinary details about the night of the martial law order.  Special Warfare Command Commander Kwak Jong-geun testified that he received a direct order from President Yoon to break the doors of the National Assembly and drag out the lawmakers, but he did not comply.  South Korea, one of East Asia’s most important economies and vital US regional ally, now faces months of protracted political uncertainty of the kind that dominated the country during the last impeachment crisis in 2016 and 2017.  Then-president Park Geun-hye was ultimately impeached by lawmakers over corruption allegations, kicked out of office by the Constitutional Court, jailed and later pardoned.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/entertainment/chappell-charli-sabrina-pop-cec/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,"Pop music is messier, for the better, because of Chappell Roan, Charli XCX and Sabrina Carpenter","CNN —  This year brought us new albums from some of the biggest artists in the world: Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift all put out music that thrilled fans.  And yet some of the most impactful pop music of 2024 came not from Tay or Bey, but from three rising pop stars whose songs took us out to the clubs (Pink Pony and otherwise) and back home to the bedroom. They embraced romantic ugliness and cutting self-reflection — and pushed pop forward.  The year arguably belonged to Charli XCX, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter.  “People like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, who’ve dominated for so long — they have a sheen and a polish to them that’s somewhat unrelatable as a listener,” said Sam Murphy, a music curator who analyzes and dissects pop on his popular TikTok account. “What people really craved this year, the TikTok generation, was to see more mess and chaos in people’s lives. We wanted pop stars that we were able to see the flaws within and the charisma coming out.”  The year saw Charli, a boundary-pushing yet oft-overlooked pop veteran, finally escape what the New York Times once called “pop’s middle class” with her defiant, sweat-soaked, goopy-green opus, “Brat.”  This year, Carpenter went from a supporting act on the highest-grossing tour in history to a leading lady herself, with her endearingly silly, sexy songs topping the charts. (Here’s where she’d make a sex joke.)  And it was the year when everyone wanted to take things H-O-T T-O G-O, dance in the Pink Pony Club and wish their exes good luck, babe. Roan’s debut album came out over a year ago, but it rapidly grew an audience this year as she took her act on the road and won us over.  We loved this trio of stars because they weren’t impenetrable like Beyoncé or as towering as Swift. These artists were accessible to us, interacting with fans online and touring prolifically. Their music was personal and specific, with confessional lyrics about self-hatred, unrequited love and lust.  It helps, of course, that their music is exciting and compulsively listenable, said Mike Errico, a musician and visiting assistant arts professor at New York University’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, who teaches songwriting.  “The songs are great. They’re great writers and vocalists, and they’re working with great teams,” Errico said. “ But they also have something very urgent to say.”  None of these women became stars overnight — they’ve been recording music since they were teenagers, steadily building an audience who jibed with their unique sound. Their music doesn’t reinvent pop. But by adding their unique flavors to a well-trodden genre that’s been stuck in a rut of sameness, they’re forcing it into a looser, freer future.  “It’s been a while since there’s been a changing of the guards for people at the top,” Murphy said.  Fans want authenticity — and these artists delivered  Charli XCX belts at a Denmark music festival in July. Joseph Okpako/WireImage/Getty Images  There will always be room for artists like Swift, who’s “etched a place in history that can’t be erased,” Murphy said. But her titanic popularity has led to some “fatigue” among pop fans, he said.  “I think there’s a level of polish that is really reflective of a bygone era of pop that people aren’t relating to,” Murphy said.  Part of why Charli, Roan and Carpenter are so magnetic is because their music wasn’t made for everyone. They weren’t the biggest pop stars in the world when they were writing their breakthrough albums, so they weren’t beholden to an audience of millions. They’ve each cultivated a sound so specific that it can’t be mistaken for anything else.  “The ubiquitous, all-satisfying pop star has disappeared, and instead these niches are becoming bigger and bigger,” Murphy said. “I think that’s why it worked, that push that kept so much on that niche fanbase. It became so big to the point that it was able to start penetrating the mainstream conversation.”  Mainstream, indeed. Some of the biggest songs of the year were made by this pop trifecta. “Espresso,” especially, was inescapable, as Spotify’s most-streamed song globally with over 1.6 billion plays. “Good Luck, Babe!” also scored over one billion streams, and it was Roan’s only new single of the year.  The craving for authentic pop stars reminds Murphy of the “transition from Instagram to TikTok, where your Instagram feed was all about being polished and showing the incredible life that you were leading, even if things were really falling apart behind the scenes.”  On TikTok, meanwhile, users approach their content with inspiring candor, sharing their lives, warts and all, he said.  Charli, Roan and Carpenter take the same approach to their music. Their respective breakout albums, “Brat,” “The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess” and “Short n’ Sweet,” are all deeply personal, vibrant and, crucially, danceable records. That their voices or hearts might break along the way only adds to their considerable charms.  Works from established artists who have a quality and reputation to uphold, like Grande’s “Eternal Sunshine” or Lipa’s “Radical Optimism” — even “Cowboy Carter” and “The Tortured Poets Department,” which are both nominated for album of the year at the Grammys — ”all just got blown out of the water by these moments that felt more exciting,” Murphy said.  Live performances going viral helped artists like Chappell become stars  TikTok virality can turn a song into a hit, but it’s the art of performance that turns an artist into a star.  “I don’t think what happened to Chappell this year (would have) happened without her live stage presence,” Murphy said.  Roan cut her teeth on Olivia Rodrigo’s “Guts” tour earlier this year before joining the lineups of spring and summer musical festivals. We watched as her star rose steadily with every performance: In April, a clip of Roan performing the bridge of “Good Luck, Babe!” dressed in sleazy latex and leather at Coachella won new fans who went back and discovered her debut album. Four months later, at Lollapalooza, she played to the largest crowd in the festival’s history — organizers said as many as 110,000 people may’ve been in her audience.  Chappell Roan, pictured performing in Tennessee in October, had a busy touring schedule this year. With every tour stop, her audience grew. Jason Kempin/Getty Images  “We were watching that growth in real time, in tandem with incredible presentations of her music live,” Murphy said. “It’s difficult to imagine that kind of thing happening even five years ago, pre-pandemic.”  Carpenter’s trajectory was similar, supporting Swift on the Eras Tour before making some festival stops on her own and releasing the smash that introduced us all to the nonsensical phrase “that me espresso.”  These artists are meeting audiences where they’re at, which is, overwhelmingly, on TikTok. Charli and Chappell regularly connect with their fans on the platform, candidly delivering news directly to followers in a video instead of a manager-approved statement.  They also shirk the traditional promotional model of aiming for radio play to grow their fanbases, said music writer Reanna Cruz, who’s written for New York magazine, Rolling Stone and NPR. Now, radio is trying to play catch-up with the young fans it used to influence.  “We’re seeing younger artists that know how to access those hyper-online audiences more effectively have more success,” Cruz said.  We’re living the adjustment to mega-fame with the stars, too. Charli took a victory lap with the remix album “Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat,” on which she warped her original songs into meditations on sudden superstardom. Roan’s public grappling with invasions of privacy sparked conversations about how much stars owe their fans. And clips from Carpenter’s tour routinely go viral, most recently when Marcello Hernandez of “Saturday Night Live” stopped by, in character, as doctor-model-loverboy Domingo.  They have clear POVs that speaks to our time  Over the last decade, hip-hop has reigned as the most popular genre, Cruz and Murphy said, where innovation thrived and stars were reliably discovered. Until this year, pop, with a few exceptions, had been stuck in a rut.  The genre has been suffering from sameness throughout the back-half of the 2010s and into the 2020s, when many artists tried to appeal to all kinds of listeners without carving out their own recognizable sound. There was still room for breakouts like Lipa, Rodrigo and Billie Eilish, plus artists that blended pop and hip-hop, like Doja Cat and SZA, but pop was overwhelmingly plagued by monotony.  Enter Charli, Roan and Carpenter. While their sounds are clearly influenced by earlier acts — “Good Luck, Babe!” builds to a Kate Bush-style bridge; Carpenter’s latest album borrows from Shania Twain and Grande in parts; and Charli has mentioned electronic pioneers like Sophie and titans like Lou Reed and Daft Punk in “Brat” press — it’s their approach to the genre whose rules and boundaries are well-known that make them such exciting artists.  The artists make few compromises in their music. Charli’s beats are tailor-made for the club, with lyrics vacillating between braggadocious bombast to reflections on grief and insecurity. (“Nowadays I only eat at the good restaurants, but honestly I’m always thinkin’ ‘bout my weight,” she sings in “Rewind.”)  Roan’s campy, drag-inspired musical aesthetic has drawn more than a few comparisons to Lady Gaga’s similarly theatrical sound. It lends itself well to songs about hooking up with and falling hard for other women — still a rarity in mainstream pop. (“She did it right there, out on the deck — put her canine teeth in the side of my neck,” goes the first verse of “Red Wine Supernova.”)  Carpenter stuffs a dozen double entendres and innuendos into each deliriously raunchy song on “Short n’ Sweet.” And then sometimes, she drops the artifice and just says what she means: “I’m so f**king horny!” Here’s a pop star plainly confessing and celebrating her lust, something artists like Madonna were once lambasted for. Flirting with cheeky controversy, as with Madonna, has only boosted her profile.  Sabrina Carpenter, pictured at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, has won fans over with her retro pop sensibility and raunchy lyrics. Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty Images  Their music isn’t necessarily political, though Charli, who’s British, famously waded into the conversation when she posted, “kamala IS brat” shortly after the vice president’s candidacy in the US presidential election was announced. But the candid, confident music these pop stars make is meaningful during this turbulent moment, Errico said.  Songs like Charli’s “I think about it all the time,” in which the avowed party girl weighs motherhood, Roan’s various queer love songs and even Carpenter’s lusty, lightweight “Juno,” take on a new gravity at a time when, in the US, bodily autonomy for women and LGBTQ people is fraught and uncertain, Errico said.  “I think they’re sensing the clock turning back, and coming up with hooky, clever ways to say, ‘Over my dead body,’” Errico said. “They’re building a new army for a newly perilous time, while also having a blast.”  The future of pop, Murphy says, is tipping toward honest excess. We saw it this year with Charli transforming massive arenas into sweaty clubs, Roan painting herself with the patina of the Statue of Liberty, Carpenter enraging pearl-clutchers by striking provocative poses on tour. None of the over-the-top flourishes would work, though, without confessional bangers that both transport and ring true.  “People sometimes joke that we’re living in ‘the worst timeline,’ but these artists are determined to throw the best party anyone’s ever tried to shut down,” Errico said."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/politics/federal-government-workers-what-matters/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,How many people work for the federal government?,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.  CNN —  The US grew a lot in the past 40 years.  The US population expanded by about 100 million people  One of them was Vivek Ramaswamy, who was born in 1985 and is one of two wealthy men tasked by President-elect Donald Trump with shrinking the size of the federal government.  Government spending skyrocketed  The US spent around $900 billion in 1984 ($2.7 trillion in 2024 dollars), compared with more than $7 trillion in 2024. Some of that money goes via contracts to Elon Musk, the world’s richest man who is working with Ramaswamy on the Department of Government Efficiency, a new nongovernmental commission.  The national debt has more than exploded  It went from less than $1.6 trillion in 1984 ($4.8 trillion in 2024 dollars) to more than $35.5 trillion today, which should concern every American and is plenty of reason to make any effort to control federal spending a serious and bipartisan push.  Cut federal workers?  The current effort, run by Ramaswamy and Musk, has made a show of eyeing the size of the federal workforce. One percolating idea, according to CNN’s reporting, is that they could recommend firing every federal worker hired in the last year.  Hold on a sec  In those 40 years of explosive population, spending and debt growth, the size of the federal workforce – this is actually kind of shocking – has stayed pretty much the same, confounding the popular presumption that the number of federal workers must have skyrocketed with federal spending.  “The number of federal employees have skyrocketed over the past four years, especially the number that are working from home and not even coming to work,” the House Oversight Committee chairman, Rep. James Comer, told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Thursday, expressing that view.  A closer look at available data shows a variation of a few hundred thousand workers – which seems large but is not a grand expansion of the federal workforce.  Close to 3 million federal civilian workers for decades  There were about 2.96 million civilians, including postal workers, getting full-time paychecks from the federal government at the end of 1984, before Ramaswamy was born, and there are a hair over 3 million working for the federal government today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The official tally from the Office of Personnel Management is a smidge lower, at about 2.87 million, including postal workers.  In fact, the number of full-time federal workers has been relatively static, within a few hundred thousand civilians, since the 1960s.  Even a drawdown of the size of the military and Pentagon during the George H.W. Bush administration and of the federal workforce by hundreds of thousands during the Clinton administration did not markedly change the size of the federal workforce, which has hovered within a few hundred thousand of 3 million workers for decades.  Hundreds of thousands in, hundreds of thousands out every year  Of people who come into and go out of the federal workforce each year, there were hundreds of thousands of civilian employees (not counting postal workers) – about 250,000 to just over 300,000 – newly hired by the federal government in each of the past three years. Those are largely offset by the hundreds of thousands of civilian employees who leave the civil service each year.  Peter Morrissey is the senior director of talent and strategy at The Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for improvements to public service and commissioned a 2017 study to determine the true size of government.  “When you think about the long sweep of it, the number of public servants – people with a .gov email who work for the federal government – has been basically static as the responsibility sets have grown and grown and grown and grown and grown,” he told me. “They serve more people, and they do more stuff.”  Rising costs of social programs like Social Security and Medicare, along with rising costs of material goods, have helped drive government spending.  “People are an absolutely essential part, but in terms of the cost structure, are a comparatively small part,” he said.  In some agencies that Republicans have said they want to shutter, there are relatively few employees – such as the smallest Cabinet-level agency, the Department of Education. It employs about 4,400 employees, according to OPM. The largest federal agencies, like Veterans Affairs and the Pentagon, employ hundreds of thousands of workers.  Most federal workers are not in the DC area  Another thing to know about the federal workforce is that while its largest concentration is in the Washington, DC, metro area, the vast majority, 80%, is spread around the country in every state, but with concentrations in California, Texas, Colorado, Alabama and other states.  Concentrating on improving government might not mean shrinking it, according to Jenny Mattingley, vice president of government affairs at the Partnership for Public Service, which advocates for smarter government.  “What we keep trying to pivot the conversation to is say, let’s make sure we’re fixing government in a way that doesn’t hurt service delivery and doesn’t hurt the American public in terms of getting the things from agencies that they depend on,” she said.  ‘Giant holding company’  The government does indeed do many things. Elaine Kamarck is founding director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, and she helped spearhead an effort to reduce the size of government during the Clinton administration.  She told me it’s important not to view the US government as one monolithic thing, but rather as “essentially a giant holding company.”  “It’s doing everything from training pilots to fly advanced aircraft to tracking down cryptosporidium in your hamburger meat to cutting checks for retired people,” she said.  Firing only the most recent hires, as may be suggested by Musk and Ramaswamy, would have the added impact of scaring away future hires, as well as displacing people hired for specific roles, such as to implement the bipartisan infrastructure law passed during the Biden administration.  Once funded, agencies never go away  But Comer said people hired for specific roles and programs funded once have a tendency to stick around.  “The problem now in government, it’s been the problem for decades … is that you create a government program or create a government agency, it never goes away, even when it becomes obsolete or inefficient,” Comer told Brown on CNN.  The real deep state  On the one hand, the use of contractors and grant employees has risen as those workers, who don’t get a paycheck directly from the government but still do government work, have shouldered more of the burden.  John DiIulio, who worked in both the Barack Obama and George W. Bush administrations, wrote recently that the intersecting system of companies and local officials clamoring for federal dollars represents their own form of a deep state, and deconstructing it will be, he wrote, way harder than rocket science. Here’s an excerpt of what DiIulio wrote:  The citizens of the real deep state stoke nonstop federal deficit spending on everything from Medicare to missiles. They steer funding through intentionally maze-like federal programs. They use federal tax dollars to privately employ millions of people. They are behind the ‘waste, fraud, and abuse’ that everyone typically blames on ‘bureaucrats’ who are mostly mere grant and contract managers in a workforce that has not grown since the 1960s.  Musk, who has built companies on government contracts and subsidies, may be able to offer some insight into how the system works.  How many people actually work for the government, including contractors?  That review of “The True Size of Government” conducted for The Volcker Alliance by researcher Paul Light determined that in 1984, there were more than 6.9 million people working as civilians for the federal government when including contractors and grant employees. Add in the military and postal workers and the figure jumped to 9.8 million.  Intervening years saw a drawdown in the military after the Cold War and then a buildup during the Global War on terror. The study concluded with data from 2015, when there was a total of 9.1 million workers, or 7.3 million without the military or postal service.  Certainly the figure of contract and grant employees must have grown along with major spending bills in the past few years – with the infrastructure bill, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, which earmarked billions to transition the US to a greener economy. Comer said Musk and Ramaswamy, who will take a year and a half to make recommendations, could recommend trying to claw back unspent funds.  “There has been some pressure over years to not increase head count, and that usually leads to greater contracting,” Morrissey said, although there’s evidence that contractors frequently end up costing the government more money.  Everyone I talked to for this story agrees there is plenty of room for bipartisanship in a government efficiency effort to modernize the workforce and improve the way the federal government functions. Both Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Musk have talked about the need to control Pentagon spending, for instance. One complication for Musk will be that his firm SpaceX, in particular, is the recipient of billions in contracts."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-extradition-new-york/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Luigi Mangione: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing hires high-profile attorney as official indicates extradition fight may stop,"CNN —  A man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in Manhattan has retained a high-profile New York attorney – a development revealed on the same day an official indicated the defendant may soon stop fighting extradition from Pennsylvania, the site of his arrest, to the Empire State.  Luigi Mangione, charged in New York with second-degree murder in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has retained Karen Friedman Agnifilo – a former Manhattan prosecutor – to represent him, CNN learned Friday.  Working in private practice since 2021, Friedman Agnifilo had served under then-DA Cyrus Vance Jr. for seven years as chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, the same jurisdiction prosecuting her new client. Friedman Agnifilo, who also previously served as a CNN legal analyst, declined to comment Friday.  Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after police were alerted he looked like the man New York investigators alleged gunned down Thompson five days earlier as Thompson walked toward a Manhattan hotel hosting his company’s investors’ conference, authorities said. The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  An attorney for Mangione in Pennsylvania has denied his client’s involvement in the killing in New York and said he anticipates Mangione will plead not guilty there to the murder charge and other counts. The attorney, Thomas Dickey, also said Tuesday his client was fighting extradition to New York – a process that would have the potential to last for weeks.  But on Friday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he’s seen signs Mangione could soon waive his right to fight extradition.  “Indications are that the defendant may waive, but that waiver is not complete until a court proceeding, which my understanding from court officials in Pennsylvania cannot happen until Tuesday,” Bragg said. “So until that time, we’re going to continue to press forward on parallel paths and we’ll be ready whether he is going to waive extradition or whether he’s going to contest extradition.”  Mangione is in custody on Pennsylvania charges related to a gun and fake ID police say they found when they arrested him in Altoona. He also plans to plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, Dickey has said. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon at Pennsylvania’s Blair County Courthouse.  CNN has sought comment from Dickey about whether he and his client have changed their position on extradition.  Since Mangione’s arrest, authorities have indicated he is facing mounting evidence in the killing of Thompson, a husband and father of two. A 3D-printed gun authorities allege Mangione had when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the crime scene, and his fingerprints match those found on items near the scene, New York City’s police commissioner has said.  Authorities have pointed to other items that may point to a motive. Investigators found a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility” and writings in a spiral notebook, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. Also, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, NYPD’s Chief Detective Joseph Kenny has said. The words are similar to a title of a 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry.  Thompson’s killing has laid bare many Americans’ fury toward the health care industry, with Mangione garnering sympathy online and offers to pay his legal bills. It’s also struck fear in C-suites across the country, as the NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN warns online rhetoric could “signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term.”  Mangione – the privileged scion of a well-to-do family, high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate – vanished from view of his loved ones in recent months, only to emerge as a suspect in a high-profile killing.  New York prosecutors charged Mangione with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. The presentation of evidence to a grand jury is the next procedural step in obtaining an indictment.  If convicted of second-degree murder in New York, Mangione would face 15 years to life in prison.  As for Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s new attorney, one longtime New York prosecutor told CNN she has “as much experience as any human being, especially in the state court.”  “She knows every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse,” the source told CNN about Friedman Agnifilo.  Thomas Dickey, attorney for Luigi Mangione, speaks to press in front of the Blair County Courthouse after an extradition hearing Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, company says  While police say he identified UnitedHealthcare as one of the largest corporations in America in his writings, neither Mangione nor his mother were UnitedHealthcare members, a UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said Thursday.  The suspect appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to the NYPD intelligence report obtained Tuesday by CNN.  “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” says the NYPD assessment, which was based on Mangione’s writings and social media.  Mangione knew UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed – and mentioned in writings he would be going to the conference site, NYPD’s Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday. In a notebook passage, he mused what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference,” a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.  In some of his writings, Mangione referenced pain from a back injury he got in July 2023, Kenny said. Investigators are looking into an insurance claim for the injury.  “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.”  As he entered a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday afternoon, shackled at the hands and feet and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back, Mangione yelled, in part, “It’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience.”  Police work on December 4 work the scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in New York. Spectrum News NY1  Search warrants executed in New York  Dickey, who is representing Mangione in his Pennsylvania case, has said he wants to see the ballistics and fingerprint evidence for himself.  “Those two sciences, in and of themselves, have come under some criticism in the past, relative to their credibility, their truthfulness, their accuracy, however you want to do it,” Dickey said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” Wednesday evening.  Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of their investigation, sources tell CNN.  At least two of the warrants include a backpack found in Central Park and a burner phone found along the getaway route Mangione is believed to have taken from the shooting scene, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation confirms.  Investigators also searched a New York hostel where authorities allege Mangione stayed the night before the shooting, and the hotel room where Thompson was staying while in New York.  The handwritten document authorities allege was found on Mangione indicated “ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said Tuesday. Separate notes in a spiral notebook allegedly found on Mangione included to-do lists to facilitate a killing and references to the Unabomber, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/health/unitedhealth-children-autism-propublica/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,UnitedHealth is strategically limiting access to critical treatment for kids with autism,"This story was originally published by ProPublica.  ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive its biggest stories as soon as they’re published.  There was a time when Sharelle Menard thought her son would never be able to speak. She couldn’t soothe Benji when he cried, couldn’t read him books he could follow, couldn’t take him out in public. “The screaming, and screaming, and screaming,” she said. “He would get so frustrated because he couldn’t communicate.”  Benji was nearly 3 when he was diagnosed with severe autism and soon after started a specialized therapy to help him develop basic skills. After two years in treatment, his murmuring gave way to small words, with “bubbles” among the first. To celebrate, Menard powered up a bubble machine she found at the dollar store, and for hours, they watched the iridescent orbs drift over their porch.  Menard, who is raising Benji alone in south-central Louisiana, began to picture a future for her son that diverged from the stories she’d heard about some kids with similar diagnoses, who grew up still unable to manage their frustrations and had to live in nursing homes or institutions.  But now, she’s worried again.  The insurer that has been paying for her son’s therapy, UnitedHealthcare, has begun — to the befuddlement of his clinical team — denying him the hours they say he requires to maintain his progress. Inside the insurance conglomerate, the nation’s largest and most profitable, the slashing of care to children like Benji does have a reason, though it has little to do with their needs. It is part of a secret internal cost-cutting campaign that targets a growing financial burden for the company: the treatment of thousands of children with autism across the country.  ProPublica has obtained what is effectively the company’s strategic playbook, developed by Optum, the division that manages mental health benefits for United. In internal reports, the company acknowledges that the therapy, called applied behavior analysis, is the “evidence-based gold standard treatment for those with medically necessary needs.” But the company’s costs have climbed as the number of children diagnosed with autism has ballooned; experts say greater awareness and improved screening have contributed to a fourfold increase in the past two decades — from 1 in 150 to 1 in 36.  So Optum is “pursuing market-specific action plans” to limit children’s access to the treatment, the reports said.  “Key opportunities” are outlined in bullets in the documents. While acknowledging some areas have “very long waitlists” for the therapy, the company said it aims to “prevent new providers from joining the network” and “terminate” existing ones, including “cost outliers.” If an insurer drops a provider from its network, patients may have to find a new clinician that accepts their insurance or pay up to tens of thousands of dollars a year out of pocket for the therapy. The company has calculated that, in some states, this reduction could impact more than two-fifths of its ABA therapy provider groups in network and up to 19% of its patients in therapy.  Internal company documents reveal the strategy by Optum, a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary, to prevent ABA providers from participating in its network. Obtained by ProPublica  The strategy targets kids covered through the company’s state-contracted Medicaid plans, funded by the government for the nation’s poorest and most vulnerable patients. To manage Medicaid benefits, states often pay private insurers a fixed amount of funds per patient, regardless of the frequency or intensity of services used. When companies spend less than the allotted payment, they are typically allowed to keep some or all of what remains, which federal investigators and experts acknowledge may be incentivizing insurers to limit care.  United administers Medicaid plans or benefits in about two dozen states and for more than 6 million people, including nearly 10,000 children with autism spectrum disorder. Optum expects to spend about $290 million for ABA therapy within its Medicaid plans this year, and it anticipates the need increasing, documents show. The number of its Medicaid patients accessing the specialized therapy has increased by about 20% over the past year, with expenses rising about $75 million year-on-year.  So Optum — whose parent company, UnitedHealth Group, earned $22 billion in net profits last year — is “heavily investing” in its plan to save millions by limiting access to such care.  In addition to culling providers from its network, the company is scrutinizing the medical necessity of the therapy for individual patients with “rigorous” clinical reviews, which can lead to denials of covered treatment. Optum has developed an “approach to authorizing less units than requested,” the records state.  Internal company documents reveal Optum is deploying “rigorous utilization management” in response to an increased need for ABA therapy. Obtained by ProPublica  Mental health and autism experts and advocates reviewed ProPublica’s findings and expressed outrage over the company’s strategy. Karen Fessel, whose Mental Health and Autism Insurance Project helps families access care, called the tactics “unconscionable and immoral.”  “They’re denying access to treatment and shrinking a network at a time when they clearly know that there is an urgent need,” she said.  United and Optum declined a request ProPublica made more than a month ago for an on-the-record interview about their coverage of behavioral health care. They have not answered questions emailed 11 days ago, citing the Dec. 4 killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO as the reason. In an email, a spokesperson said “we are in mourning” and could not engage with a “non-urgent story during this incredibly difficult moment in time.” Offered an additional day or two, the company would not agree to a deadline for comment.  Benji, who is now 10, requires 33 hours of weekly therapy to be able to progress, his therapists have concluded. They have documented the consequences of having even a few hours less: toppled furniture, scratched-up classroom aides, a kid in unremitting tears, unable to learn. But in a letter to Menard, Optum said it was refusing to pay for the full hours, stating that her son had been in therapy for too long and was not showing enough progress to ultimately graduate from it.  “Your child still has a lot of difficulty with all autism-related needs,” Optum wrote. “Your child still needs help, but it does not appear that your child will improve enough to end ABA.”  The response confounded experts who spoke with ProPublica, who said such an approach misunderstands the long-term nature of his condition. “Challenges that often come with autism shouldn’t be looked at like an injury that you’re going to get better from quickly and then the treatment can stop,” said Christa Stevens, who directs state government affairs for the advocacy group Autism Speaks. “Treatment may still be medically necessary even if it’s for skill maintenance or the prevention of regression.”  The company’s denial also appears to contrast with recent professional guidelines for the therapy — which are cited as a reference in Optum’s own clinical criteria — that state “there is no specific limit on the duration of a course of treatment.”  The appropriate duration of treatment, according to those standards and experts interviewed by ProPublica, should be based on the patients’ needs, as evaluated by the clinicians working directly with the patients.  “This is a very blunt instrument to chase after excessive costs,” said Tim Clement, the vice president of federal government affairs at the nonprofit group Mental Health America.  Several advocates told ProPublica the company’s strategy is legally questionable.  The federal mental health parity law requires insurers to provide the same access to mental health and physical care. As ProPublica recently reported, United has gotten in trouble in the past for targeting therapy coverage in a way that violates the law; while denying the allegations, it agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement. It continues to use arbitrary and one-size-fits-all thresholds to scrutinize its therapy claims, ProPublica previously found.  It would raise legal questions if the company restricted ABA more stringently than comparable physical care, the advocates said.  “Medicaid managed care organizations are subject to the parity act,” said Deborah Steinberg, a senior health policy attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Legal Action Center. The company may be violating Medicaid regulations, she said, which require managed care organizations to maintain networks sufficient to provide covered services to all enrollees.  Last year, the federal government formally affirmed that ABA therapy is a protected benefit, and it recently investigated health plans for entirely excluding its coverage; legislators have passed laws in every state requiring insurance companies to pay for it.  “Yes, this therapy can be expensive,” said Dan Unumb, an attorney and president of the Autism Legal Resource Center. “But solving the problem by denying kids access to medically necessary care is a terrible solution.”  ‘What happens if we withdraw the care?’  Benji dances with his behavior analyst, Whitney Newton, at Aspire Behavioral Health Center in Lafayette. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  Benji was making progress about three years ago.  For more than 33 hours a week in the specialized therapy, his clinicians broke down the learning process into basic steps, using repetition and positive reinforcement to affirm behaviors. The state’s Medicaid contractor, UnitedHealthcare, covered the bill.  Researchers have found that about a quarter of kids diagnosed with autism are severely affected; these children are often minimally or non-speaking or require extensive assistance for basic daily needs. “Things a lot of people take for granted,” said Menard. While experts continue to debate which therapies are most effective and appropriate for these kids, ABA is one of the most widely recommended.  By 7, Benji had accumulated a few dozen words, and his aggressive, prolonged tantrums had grown less frequent, allowing his mother to take him grocery shopping and to mass on Sundays. It was time for him to go to school, she thought.  Menard enrolled him in their public school district, St. Martin Parish. He attended Breaux Bridge Primary twice a week in a special education classroom and continued therapy the other days. Menard urged the district to allow a therapeutic technician to shadow him in school, but it refused. (The district declined to respond to ProPublica’s questions, citing privacy restrictions.)  With the diminished hours of treatment, Benji grew increasingly disruptive. “It was a disaster,” said Menard. He snapped a swing in gym class and struggled to sit still during lessons. When teachers tried to give him instructions, he hit them. His speech plateaued and eventually regressed.  Menard, who cleans pools for a living, grew to fear the moment her phone rang. School employees, unable to soothe Benji’s tantrums, frequently called her to take him home. One morning last spring, they told her Benji had lashed out when an aide tried to persuade him to work, aggressively poking their hand with a pencil. He hadn’t broken the skin, but after a dozen incidents, the situation was becoming unsalvageable. The district made her sign a behavioral contract, his second in two years: If Benji didn’t behave, he could be suspended or expelled.  Menard felt she had no choice but to withdraw Benji. She enrolled him full time in a home-study program run by his therapy group, Aspire Behavioral Health Center in Lafayette, which costs about $10,000 a year in tuition, a substantial portion of her paycheck. That was in addition to the therapy cost, which his insurance still covered.  Benji’s clinicians determined he needed direct support for most of the day and told Optum they wanted him to scale up his therapy from 24 hours a week to 33. They expected the insurer would approve the request; after all, it was less than what was previously covered and only nine hours more than it was currently paying for.  But Optum denied the increase in a letter to Menard this past May. “Your child has been in ABA for six years,” the insurer wrote. “After six years, more progress would be expected.”  The response disturbed Whitney Newton, Benji’s behavior analyst and a clinical director at Aspire; it didn’t seem rooted in the established medical standards for the treatment. She’d seen firsthand how critical the therapy had been to his growth. “We know what he needs. It’s in our scope of practice and it’s our right as the provider to determine that,” she said. “They’re cutting and denying an unethical amount.”  The center’s founder, psychologist Joslyn McCoy, has grown accustomed to battling insurers. Her practice serves about 160 patients between the ages of 2 and 19 across five centers, and many have Medicaid coverage. In 2022, Louisiana expanded its Medicaid parameters, allowing parents with higher incomes to access coverage for children with complex medical needs.  “What I’m seeing is that children now have this ticket to access this care, but then once they go to try to access it, it’s being denied,” she said.  Nearly two years ago, Optum selected her center for a payment integrity audit, demanding to inspect its clinical and billing records. After her team turned over thousands of pages of documentation, Optum conducted a separate in-person quality review.  Internal company records show Optum is targeting ABA providers for scrutiny based on how much they invoice and how many services they provide. Groups like McCoy’s can be flagged for patterns that providers told ProPublica are typical in the delivery of ABA therapy: billing on weekends or holidays, serving multiple family members in one practice, having long clinician or patient days, providing an “above average delivery” of services, or abruptly increasing or decreasing the number of patients or claims.  Internal company documents reveal Optum’s strategy for identifying ABA providers for scrutiny based on “outlier patterns.” Obtained by ProPublica  McCoy said that a company executive who visited her office for the quality review told her that she approved of the center’s work and thought Aspire should expand across the state.  But Optum has continued to challenge her patients’ individual therapy claims.  When her team received the denial for Benji’s care, McCoy set out to gather hard evidence to demonstrate the necessity of his treatment. “It’s what we call a reversal to baseline, where we will withdraw the treatment for a short period of time,” McCoy said. “The reason is to demonstrate what happens because we’re curious, too: What happens if we withdraw the care?”  Much of the therapy is driven by positive reinforcement; for example, if Benji pays attention and engages in his academic exercises, he can take a break to play on his iPad. But the reward is contingent on him not hitting anyone for at least 10 minutes at a time. During the experiment, the clinicians took away the possibility of his reward, and without an incentive, they had limited leverage to manage his behavior.  Joslyn McCoy, founder and director of Aspire Behavioral Health Center. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  At first, Benji lightly hit the staff, they said, as though testing the limits. But when there was no response to his behavior, it began to escalate. He tossed chairs and flipped tables. He pushed Newton into a bookshelf, which collapsed to the ground. He hit walls and windows, eventually turning his fists on his aide. They stopped the experiment early, both for his safety and theirs.  Once they resumed the interventions, Benji was able to calm down.  Newton drafted a report, including line charts that quantified his behavior with and without the interventions and photographs of her team’s injuries. She faxed it to Optum, asking the company to reconsider the denial.  The insurer did not change its decision.  ‘The need is not going away’  Last month, inside a cubicle decorated with posters of Minions and Mario Brothers, a behavior technician placed a laminated card with an image of a sneaker in front of Benji.  “What is this?” she asked him.  Benji paused, rubbing the edge of his baseball cap and pursing his lips. “Sh,” he said, stuck on the consonant.  “Shoes, that’s right,” the technician responded. She pulled out another card, showing a slice topped with white frosting. “Is this cake?”  “No,” Benji said.  “Is this cake?” she repeated, before adding, “yes.”  “Yes,” echoed Benji, but her correction appeared to frustrate him. He hit the technician on the leg, softly but with determination.  “We’ll let it go,” she warned with a sugared voice, “but hands to self, OK?”  Benji works with registered behavioral technician Hortencia Cervantez during ABA treatment. Annie Flanagan, special to ProPublica  After 10 minutes, a timer beeped. It was time for Benji’s reward, getting to hear a reggaeton hit by Daddy Yankee. “It’s a big reinforcer here,” Newton said.  Even though Optum denied the additional hours of treatment, Benji has continued to receive them. “We’re giving the hours even if they were not approved,” McCoy said. “We don’t think it would be safe for him to do what the insurance is saying.”  Next month, a state administrative law judge will hear an appeal for the additional hours. If the request is approved, Benji’s clinicians will be paid for the six months of services that they’ve provided without reimbursement.  Even if that happens, their battle with the insurer will go back to square one. Each insurance authorization typically lasts for only six months, and soon after the hearing date, the clinicians will have to request coverage for his treatment again.  They will be doing so at a time when internal records show Optum has deployed more than 90 “care advocates” to question clinicians about the medical necessity of their patients’ ABA treatment, using “quality initiatives to decrease overutilization and cost.”  Optum is focusing on states whose Medicaid plans yield the highest costs for ABA therapy, including Arizona, Nebraska, Tennessee, Virginia, New Jersey, Indiana and Louisiana, where Menard and her son live. ProPublica reached out to the state Medicaid programs with questions about their oversight of United’s practices. Arizona’s Medicaid agency told ProPublica that all managed care organizations, including United, are required to provide timely services within their networks, and that the agency has been closely monitoring ABA networks. (Read its full response.) No other state Medicaid agencies responded to ProPublica’s questions.  Internal company documents reveal Optum’s strategy for managing its ABA coverage. Obtained by ProPublica  Autism experts said such a strategy may not only be harmful to children, it could also ultimately be more expensive for states, as children age and require more intensive services, like residential or nursing care.  “If these kids get the intervention they need as children, then there will be tremendous cost savings over the course of their lives,” said Lorri Unumb, an attorney and CEO of the Council of Autism Service Providers.  Menard worries about what will happen to her son’s hard-fought gains if he can’t get the level of therapy he needs. And even if the additional nine hours are approved, she fears that with the next authorization, they could face a more drastic denial that could be challenging to overturn.

She just hopes the therapy helps him to be better able to advocate for himself and, ultimately, be safe. “There’s nothing else that I’ve known to work,” she said.  McCoy resents being put in the position of scaling back care that her patient needs because an insurer is refusing to pay. “It puts us in a tough place, because we don’t want to discontinue therapy of our client who’s not ready,” she said.  When such denials become common, it disincentivizes clinicians from working with insurance companies, she said, and can ultimately drive clinics into the ground. “The patients can’t afford it,” she said, “so eventually the private provider goes out of business.”  But even if children like Benji get pushed out of treatment, there is no shortage of children seeking care. McCoy’s center currently has a waitlist of about 260 children.  That list may likely expand. Internal documents show Optum is aiming to exclude from its network about 40% of Louisiana groups that offer ABA therapy. About 1 in 5 children whose treatment is covered by the company’s Medicaid plan in the state could lose access to care.  “If the insurance company wants to deny all of our clients, we’re going to replace them,” she said. “The need is not going away.”"

CNN —  Flybys of Jupiter’s fiery moon Io, carried out by NASA’s Juno spacecraft, are helping to solve the enduring mystery of why the small moon is the most volcanically active body in our solar system.  Similar in size to Earth’s moon, Io has an estimated 400 volcanoes that continuously release plumes and lava that coat that moon’s surface.  The Juno mission, which has been orbiting and observing Jupiter and its moons since July 2016, made incredibly close flybys of Io in December 2023 and February. The spacecraft zipped within 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) of the moon’s surface, capturing images and data. Together, Juno’s flybys have enabled an unprecedented look at the smoldering moon, including taking observations of its poles for the first time.  Researchers presented some of the results from an analysis of the flyby data Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in Washington, DC. A paper detailing some of the findings was also published Thursday in the journal Nature.  “Io is one of the most intriguing objects in the whole solar system,” said study coauthor Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator and an associate vice president at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “We can see that this body is completely covered with volcanoes over both poles and all across its middle, (which are) constantly going off.”  Volcanoes on the surface of Io erupt continuously, as depicted in this animation. NASA  The new data suggests that Io’s numerous volcanoes are each likely powered by their own chamber of hot magma, rather than being fed by a global ocean of magma beneath the surface. The latter had long been a prevailing hypothesis by astronomers.  The finding could change the way astronomers understand moons dominated by subsurface global oceans in our solar system, such as Jupiter’s moon Europa and planets beyond our solar system.  Spotting a cosmic pizza  Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, known as the father of modern astronomy, discovered Io on January 8, 1610.  But the moon’s wild volcanic activity wasn’t detected until Voyager 1 flew by Jupiter and its moons in 1979, revealing Io’s dynamic surface that resembled a pepperoni pizza, Bolton said.  NASA's Juno spacecraft captures the north polar region of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io on December 30, 2023. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS  That year, Linda Morabito, an imaging scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, became the first person to identify a volcanic plume as she studied an image of Io captured by Voyager 1.  The revelation sparked a decades-long mystery as astronomers wondered about the origins of Io’s constant volcanic activity.  “Since Morabito’s discovery, planetary scientists have wondered how the volcanoes were fed from the lava underneath the surface,” Bolton said. “Was there a shallow ocean of white-hot magma fueling the volcanoes, or was their source more localized? We knew data from Juno’s two very close flybys could give us some insights on how this tortured moon actually worked.”  This sequence of images taken by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2007 shows a giant plume from Io's Tvashtar volcano. NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute  Flyby revelations  Io orbits around Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, which Bolton calls a “monster.” The moon’s orbit is imperfect, meaning that sometimes it comes closer to Jupiter during its orbit, and other times it is farther away. Io completes one orbit around the planet every 42.5 hours.  Jupiter’s massive gravitational influence squeezes Io as it orbits the planet, like a hand squeezing a rubber ball, which warms up the moon. This phenomenon is called tidal flexing, or friction from tidal forces that generate internal heat.  “That’s what’s happening inside Io,” Bolton said. “That squeezing is generating heat, and it’s getting so hot that (Io’s) insides are literally melting and popping out. The eruptions are constant. It’s like a nonstop rainstorm. It’s just always erupting all over the place.”  Io is tiny in comparison with Jupiter, as seen in this animation, and the giant planet's gravitational forces cause the inhospitable conditions on the fiery moon. CNN/NASA  The constant flexing of Jupiter’s tug on Io generates immense energy, which would melt part of the moon’s interior, Bolton said. And if the melting was substantial enough, it would create a global magma ocean that Juno could use its instruments to detect.  During its close flybys, Juno captured high-precision Doppler data, which measured Io’s gravity by tracking how zipping closely to the moon affected the spacecraft’s acceleration. The data was compared with observations from previous missions that have flown by Jupiter and its moons, such as NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, as well as ground-based telescopes.  Together, the observations point to a rigid, mostly solid interior beneath Io’s surface, rather than a global magma ocean — solving a 45-year mystery started by Voyager 1’s observations. Instead, the volcanoes are powered by more local sources, and each one has its own pocket of magma beneath it.  “Juno’s discovery that tidal forces do not always create global magma oceans does more than prompt us to rethink what we know about Io’s interior,” said lead study author Ryan Park, a Juno co-investigator and supervisor of the Solar System Dynamics Group at JPL, in a statement. “It has implications for our understanding of other moons, such as (Saturn’s) Enceladus and Europa, and even exoplanets and super-Earths. Our new findings provide an opportunity to rethink what we know about planetary formation and evolution.”  The mission has also helped to capture an array of imagery that showcases Io’s “primordial fantasy land surface,” said Heidi Becker, a planetary scientist at JPL who was not involved in the study. The images are bringing different features on Io into focus like never before, including islands spotted on massive lava lakes, such as one called Loki Patera, which is so large that astronomers compare it more to a lava sea sitting on Io’s surface.  This animation shows the harsh features created by lava on the surface of Io. CNN/JPL  The Juno spacecraft continues to contribute new insights about Jupiter and its moons, having recently completed a flyby over Jupiter’s swirling cloud tops on November 24. Next, Juno will swing by 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers) above Jupiter’s center on December 27, logging 645.7 million miles (1.04 billion kilometers) since beginning its investigation of Jupiter eight years ago."
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/from-true-crimes-to-terror-when-is-dark-tourism-too-dark/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,From true crimes to terror: When is ‘dark tourism’ too dark?,"CNN —  Fifty years ago, parishioners from Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple in San Francisco began to settle a rural commune in the South American country of Guyana. The Jonestown experiment ended four years later in one of the most tragic and bizarre murder-suicide incidents in American history. More than 900 people died on November 18, 1978, including a US congressman named Leo Ryan.  Now that Guyana is considering a proposal by a government-backed tour operator to open the now-overgrown compound to visitors, it raises a fascinating debate about the appeal, ethics and sensitivities of so-called “dark tourism” — the visiting of sites associated with tragedy.  Why are the locations of past atrocities, natural disasters, infamous deaths and incarcerations so popular with visitors? What does it say about us that we want to get close to these vortexes of disaster and evil? What obligations do governments have to give or deny access? Who gets to decide how history is presented to visitors? And what impact do such events and the subsequent visitors have on those who live near these spots?  There are no simple answers, but it’s important to explore the questions anyway.  Is it not simply history?  The welcome sign at the entrance of Jonestown, Guyana in 2022.

Design Pics Inc/Shutterstock dark tourism Prev Next  On my first cross-country trip, in college, my girlfriend and I stopped at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, the site of a battle in which nearly 200 died, including a former US congressman named Davy Crockett. Then a week later in Los Angeles, local relatives of mine took us on a driving tour that included the crime scene address of then-recently murdered Nicole Brown Simpson. The former visit felt like a US history lesson, the latter like morbid gawking. And somewhere in between is the subjective line that dark tourism dances around.  Dark tourism (also known as memorial tourism, or thanatourism, from the Greek “Thanatos” meaning death, or more derogatorily as morbid tourism, or grief tourism) comes in various shades.  Gettysburg was the single deadliest battle in the US Civil War, where 51,000 souls took their last breath, and yet where countless school field trips and, according to the National Park Service, 1.5 million visitors flock every year. Is that dark tourism? How about visiting the beaches in France where between 8,000 and 14,000 soldiers died in the D-Day invasions that turned the tide for Allies winning World War II? And what of Ground Zero and Flight 93 memorials for more than 3,000 who died on September 11, 2001?  I have toured Cambodia’s Killing Fields, with a survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide that left between 1.5 and 3 million murdered (in the four years following the Jonestown tragedy). Isn’t it important to visit atrocities such as that one, and former Nazi concentration camps?  The point of visiting these places is to feel uncomfortable, to bear witness, to share what you’ve seen and how it made you feel. Travel changes us, and sometimes because of exposure to the worst of human nature.  You’ve heard of the Disneyfication of places. Dark tourism is the opposite of that. These are the unhappiest places on earth. Yet they are places you should never forget. To go there honors the dead, their memory, their pain.  How far is too far?  There are examples when the line seems less clear, where bearing witness to past events feels more like slowing down to see the aftermath of a fatal car accident.  The first time I visited Savannah, Georgia I took a “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” tour. This was not long after the best-selling book of that name became a Hollywood film chronicling a real double murder that took place less than 10 years earlier. On the tour I kept thinking, “The people who live next door to these places may actually remember the victims, may have even been friends with them.”  People outside the Beverly Hills, California mansion where brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents in 1989 David Swanson/AFP/Getty Images  Just last month we reported on how the Los Angeles mansion where Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents has become the latest “dark tourism” hot spot. The brothers are back in the news and the subject of a recent documentary, but it’s hard to imagine what visitors are learning by simply staring at a crime scene. It reminded me of my Simpson murder scene visit, or the time I tried to find LA’s Cielo Drive, the site of the 1969 murders by the Manson “family.”  But how many degrees are those stops from touring Ford’s Theatre in Washington DC where a president was shot, or the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas from which another was? Is it ok to see thousands of Mount Vesuvius’ victims in Pompei, Italy because they were killed 2,000 years ago? How about going on an entertaining tour of Jack the Ripper’s victims in London from the late 1800s? Or paying a lot of money to go deep underwater for a view of the Titanic – where visitors themselves died last year while exploring a shipwreck where about 1,500 died just over 100 years ago? Does time desensitize us to these crimes and tragedies?  What is your intention?  In the early 2000s, while visiting friends living in Gloucester, Massachusetts, I felt an undertow pulling me toward the Crow’s Nest, the local bar made famous in a book by Sebastian Junger and the subsequent film of the same name, “The Perfect Storm.” They document the 1991 storm and final days of six fishermen from the small, tight knit community who frequented the Crow’s Nest.  On one visit I was walking along Gloucester’s small harbor when I saw a new ice cream shop had opened called The Perfect Scoop. I thought it rather distasteful, a description I’ve never before nor since used to describe ice cream, and it left me feeling embarrassed for having wanted to visit the Crow’s Nest. I decided to leave the salty bar to the locals.  The bookcase to the secret annex in the renovated Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Frank died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945 at the age of 15. Koen Van Weel/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock  But I’ve enjoyed the murder-heavy night tour of San Francisco’s Alcatraz prison island; walked through the “Bloody Sunday” neighborhood of Derry, Northern Ireland; visited Anne Frank’s home in Amsterdam and was equally moved by The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, inside the old Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. This summer I’m planning a family trip to Japan and added Hiroshima to the itinerary because I feel it’s important for my daughters to make a connection to the violence our country unleashed on another country, killing at least 66,000 in that city alone.  And I’ve long wanted to visit Jonestown. When I lived in San Francisco, just before seeing a show at the famous Fillmore auditorium, I popped around the corner to see the location of Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple, the last stop before Guyana. I feel drawn to follow that nightmare of a story into the real world, where it has been sitting in situ since the mass deaths. I want to talk to those who live nearby, understand the events more clearly, bear witness, go into the heart of darkness.  Perhaps the salient question to ask oneself before planning such a trip is: What is the intention? Is it to learn and understand? Or is it merely to scratch the itch of a morbid curiosity? Think about the locals, of the friends and family who are connected to the tragedy and ask whether visiting honors a legacy or exploits a tragedy. In the end, you may be the only one who can judge the ethics of visiting these places."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/politics/pelosi-hospital-injury/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Pelosi undergoes successful hip replacement surgery after fall on stairs in Luxembourg,"CNN —  Rep. Nancy Pelosi underwent a “successful” hip replacement surgery Saturday and is “well on the mend,” according to a spokesperson, one day after being hospitalized from an injury sustained during an official engagement in Luxembourg.  Pelosi was admitted to a hospital in Luxembourg as the result of a fall on the stairs, three sources told CNN. Pelosi’s office declined to comm﻿ent on how the California congresswoman was injured.  Pelosi, 84, is receiving “excellent care” from doctors and medical professionals, Ian Krager, the spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday.  The US military had medevaced the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. The medical center is a major military hospital that for years has treated US troops injured in combat.  “While traveling with a bipartisan Congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation,” Krager said Friday.  Pelosi is “currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals. She continues to work and regrets that she is unable to attend the remainder of the CODEL engagements to honor the courage of our servicemembers during one of the greatest acts of American heroism in our nation’s history,” Krager said, adding that Pelosi “looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.”  The injury sustained by Pelosi came just days after longtime Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell tripped and fell at the US Capitol, spraining his wrist and cutting his face.  McConnell sustained a “minor cut to the face” and was “cleared to resume his schedule,” a spokesperson for the 82-year-old Kentucky Republican said in a statement Tuesday.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/entertainment/jay-z-lawsuit-response/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Jay-Z says inconsistencies in rape accuser’s story proves her attorney was looking for ‘money and fame’,"CNN —  Jay-Z is doubling down on his denial that he ever raped a teenage girl alongside Sean “Diddy” Combs, saying that newly revealed inconsistencies in her story prove that her account is not credible.  Earlier this week, an anonymous Jane Doe filed an amended complaint against Combs and Jay-Z, whose given name is Shawn Carter, which revealed that a previously unnamed celebrity in her original complaint against Combs, initially filed in October, was Carter. In the amended complaint, Carter is accused of raping the then-13-year-old Jane Doe at an afterparty for the MTV Video Music Awards in the year 2000.  The amended complaint made Carter the first celebrity to be accused of sexual assault in connection to Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to three federal charges and is awaiting a criminal trial.  In a new interview on Friday, the Jane Doe said she is standing by her rape accusation against Carter, but admits to inconsistencies in her original story, including key corroborating witnesses.  “I have made some mistakes,” the Jane Doe told NBC News. “You should always advocate for yourself and be a voice for yourself. You should never let what somebody else did ruin or run your life. I just hope I can give others the strength to come forward like I came forward.”  In her initial complaint, Jane Doe said that she asked her father to pick her up in 2000 after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Carter and Combs. But her father now said that he does not recall picking her up, according to NBC News, which also reported that Jane Doe said that she spoke to a celebrity the night she alleged she was raped, but that celebrity said they were not in New York at the time her allegations took place.  Jane Doe’s attorney, Tony Buzbee, said that he is still vetting his client’s claims, but is standing by her accusations.  “Our client remains fiercely adamant that what she has stated is true, to the best of her memory. We will continue to vet her claims and collect corroborating data to the extent it exists. Because we have interrogated her intensely, she has even agreed to submit to a polygraph. I’ve never had a client suggest that before,” Buzbee told CNN via email on Friday evening. “In any event, we always do our best to vet each claim made, just as we did in this case. This has been extremely distressing for her, to the point she has experienced seizures and had to seek medical treatment due to the stress.”  In a statement issued to CNN, Carter said that the woman’s inconsistencies “proves” that Buzbee “filed a false complaint against me in the pursuit of money and fame.”  “This incident didn’t happen and yet he filed it in court and doubled down in the press,” Carter’s statement continued. “True Justice is coming. We fight FROM victory, not FOR victory. This was over before it began. This 1-800 lawyer doesn’t realize it yet, but, soon.”  Carter’s attorney, Alex Spiro, told CNN: “It is stunning that a lawyer would not only file such a serious complaint without proper vetting, but would make things worse by further peddling this false story in the press. We are asking the Court to dismiss this frivolous case today, and will take up the matter of additional discipline for Mr. Buzbee and all the lawyers that filed the complaint.”  Spiro also filed a letter to the judge on Friday night, regarding the inconsistencies in Jane Doe’s account, calling her allegations a “sham.”  “Basic facts in her narrative – the who, what, when, and where – are wrong,” Spiro wrote to the judge. “When pressed, the Plaintiff admitted she was ‘guessing’ about key details… She admits she has no single corroborating witness over the last 24 years.”  Prior to Buzbee filing Jane Doe’s amended complaint in which Carter was named, Carter’s lawyers had filed an extortion suit against Buzbee, claiming that the Houston-based attorney was trying to “shakedown innocent celebrities, politicians, and businesspeople with an army of masked accusers.”  Lawyers for Combs, who has previously denied all civil allegations against him, criticized Buzbee in a statement to CNN.  “This is the beginning of the end of this shameful money grab.”"

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Downtown San Francisco experiences first tornado warning in recorded history,"CNN —  For the first time in recorded history, downtown San Francisco was issued a tornado warning on Saturday as severe storms swept through the city, just one week after a tsunami warning triggered widespread panic in the region.  The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado threat ended around 6:14 a.m. PST after the storm moved northeast of downtown.  “Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. If you are outdoors, in a mobile, home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from debris,” SFDEM urged residents in an earlier tweet.  The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued a flood advisory and high wind warning, with sustained winds of up to 40 mph expected in areas along the coast. San Francisco Airport reported a wind gust of 72 knots (83 mph) at the time the storm passed by. Videos show extreme winds shaking palm trees in San Francisco and downed trees and power lines.  More than 10,000 people were without power in San Francisco as of Saturday morning.  California averages nine tornadoes in a year. No tornado warnings had ever previously been recorded for downtown San Francisco, the NWS confirmed.  One week prior, a tsunami warning was issued for the San Francisco Bay area and nearly 5 million people along parts of the Northern California and Oregon coastlines after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the California coast on December 5. A quake that strong is relatively rare, with officials reporting only about 15 around the world each year.  Coastal communities avoided potential disaster and the warning was canceled by the National Tsunami Warning Center after some residents fled their homes. Most significant off-coast quakes prompt such warnings, as experts have little time to determine the immediate risk, and the result of a tsunami could be disastrous.  The quake’s epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean south of Eureka, California, the US Geological Survey said. Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and about 300 miles northwest of Sacramento."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/bob-fernandez-pearl-harbor-death/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Pearl Harbor survivor Bob Fernandez dies at 100,"Honolulu AP —  Bob Fernandez, a 100-year-old survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, died shortly after deteriorating health prompted him to skip a trip to Hawaii to attend last week’s remembrance ceremony marking the 83rd anniversary of the attack.  Fernandez died peacefully at the Lodi, California, home of his nephew, Joe Guthrie, on Wednesday. Guthrie’s daughter, Halie Torrrell, was holding his hand when he took his last breath. Fernandez suffered a stroke about a month ago that caused him to slow down but Guthrie said doctors attributed his condition to age.  “It was his time,” Guthrie said.  Fernandez was a 17-year-old sailor on board the USS Curtiss during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the U.S. into World War II. A mess cook, he was waiting tables and bringing sailors morning coffee and food when they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane fly by with the red ball insignia known to be painted on Japanese aircraft.  He rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing shells so they could pass them to the ship’s guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire above.  “I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” Fernandez told The Associated Press in an interview weeks before his death.  Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle.  “We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,” Fernandez said. “But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.”  Pearl Harbor Navy veteran Bob Fernandez poses for a photograph with medals from his military service, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, in Lodi, Calif. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP  Fernandez had been planning to return to Pearl Harbor last week to attend an annual commemoration hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service but became too weak to make the trip, Guthrie said.  He was “so proud” of his six years in the Navy, all of it aboard the USS Curtiss, Guthrie said. Most of his casual clothes, like hats and shirts, were related to his service.  “It was just completely ingrained in him,” his nephew said.  Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California, after the war. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014.  He enjoyed music and dancing, and until recently attended weekly music performances at a local park and a restaurant. He helped neighbors in his trailer park take care of their yards until he moved in with Guthrie last year.  “I’d do yard work and split firewood and he’d swing the axe a little bit,” Guthrie said. “We’d call it his physical therapy.”  Fernandez’s advice for living a long life included stopping eating once you’re full and marching up stairs. He said it was OK to take a nap, but do something like laundry or wash dishes before going to bed. He recommended being kind to everyone.  Guthrie said he thinks Fernandez would want to be remembered for bringing people joy.  “He would rake people’s yards if they couldn’t do it. He would paint a fence. He would help somebody,” Guthrie said. “He would give people money if they needed something. He was so generous and such a kind person. He made friends everywhere.”  Fernandez is survived by his oldest son, Robert J. Fernandez, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren.  There are 16 known survivors of Pearl Harbor who are still alive, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. All of them are at least 100 years old.  Fernandez’s death would have brought the number to 15 but Farley recently learned of an additional survivor."

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/tech/aircraft-drone-identifier-apps/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Want to know what’s flying overhead? There’s an app for that,"New York CNN —  People in New Jersey are freaking(!) out(!) about sightings of what they say appear to be “giant drones” flying around at night. Government officials have said at least some of those sightings are just regular, old commercial flights.  Turns out, there are a few apps that could help prevent that kind of confusion.  Apps like Flightradar24, Plane Finder and FlightAware all have features that let users see, in real-time, what aircraft are flying around them, including the thousands of commercial and private flights and helicopters that may be in the skies at any given time. In some cases, the apps can also identify unmanned aircraft, such as commercial drones that are signaling their location the same way planes do.  With these apps — or their websites — you can open a map of your location and see the air traffic above you, along with details about individual aircraft such as its altitude, speed and destination. You may also see a code denoting the plane’s airline or a registration code for private aircraft.  With FlightRadar24 and Plane Finder, you can also point your phone camera at an aircraft in the sky and the apps will tell you about it, even at night — kind of like Shazam for airplanes.  Flightradar24 says that on any given day, it can track more than 200,000 aircraft through the skies. And following these planes has become a hobby for some people; for example, in August 2022, when a US Air Force plane carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan, more than 700,000 people witnessed the event in real-time via Flightradar24.  These apps work by collecting the data that most aircraft transmit to ground stations and other aircraft, known as “ADS-B” data, as well as satellites and other data sources.  But if you have trouble identifying a plane on the app, you may need to zoom out on the map — experts say aircraft are often farther away than they appear to the human eye.  Of course, not every aircraft is going to show up on those platforms — some small hobby drones, for example, don’t contain the kind of technology to broadcast their locations the way commercial aircraft do. Some military and high-profile aircraft, like Air Force One, are also blocked."

Amrita Rosha, 45, is among those choosing to flee with her children. Both of them — Vanaaya, 4, and Abhiraj, 9 — suffer from respiratory problems due to rising pollution and need medication.  “We have no other option but to leave Delhi,” Rosha, a housewife who is married to a businessman, told CNN last month from her home in an affluent South Delhi neighborhood as she completed last-minute packing before leaving for the Gulf state of Oman.  Every year for the past decade, a blanket of smog has enveloped Delhi when winter approaches, turning day into night and disrupting the lives of millions of people. Some of them, particularly young children with less developed immune systems, are forced to seek medical care for breathing issues.  Rosha ensures her children get top health care — including doctors’ visits, steamers, inhalers and steroids — and trips outside Delhi to escape the choking air.

Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  While wealthy families like the Roshas can escape, it’s a different story for those without the means to leave.  About 15 miles away in a Delhi slum, Muskan, who goes by her first name, looks on with worry at the remaining medicine drops for her children’s nebulizer, a machine which turns liquid medication into fine mist to be inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece.  The mother rations its use because she struggles to afford more.  “We give half-half (of the dosage) of the medicines to our children,” she said, referring to Chahat, 3, and Diya, 1. They’ve been on nebulizers since each of their first winters, as early as they were born.  Muskan bought the $9 nebulizer after weeks of hard work on the streets. She makes a living picking up rags and other pieces of refuse, and her husband is a day laborer.  “When they cough, I feel scared that my children may die. I’m filled with regret, as I keep worrying about something awful happening to them,” she said.  Muskan holds her daughter Diya while while her 3-year-old son Chahat uses the nebulizer. “He thinks it is a toy,” she said as he puts it on himself with ease. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  Leaving Delhi  The suffering of Delhi’s children, year after year, has become impossible to ignore.  “Children are having to rely on steroids and inhalers to breathe … all of north India has been pushed into a medical emergency,” Delhi’s Chief Minister Atishi, who goes by her first name, said last month.  The Supreme Court has stepped in to monitor the measures introduced to curb pollution, which is generally caused by a combination of factors including vehicular emissions, crop burning and construction work, along with unfavorable meteorological and climatic conditions.  This has included banning cars, demolition and construction work, and spraying roads with water. Authorities have also increased public transport and cracked down on crop burning.  Despite these measures, Delhi has remained the most polluted city across India in November for eight years, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.  Manjinder Singh Randhawa, a doctor in the pediatric intensive care unit at the Rainbow Children’s Hospital, said this year he has been diagnosing younger children with asthma in “a very critical state” for the first time.  Video Ad Feedback India's toxic smog puts children at risk 02:54 - Source: CNN  In the long-term, pollution can have a serious impact on the respiratory, immune and cardiovascular systems, he added.  CNN has reached out for comment to the central and state government, and the Commission for Air Quality Management responsible for maintaining air quality in the region.  In some parts of Delhi last month, pollution levels exceeded 1,750 on the Air Quality Index, according to IQAir, which monitors global air pollution. Any reading above 300 is considered a health hazard.  During these weeks the pollution levels for PM 2.5, smaller particles which can penetrate deep into the lungs, spiked to more than 70 times the health limits set by the World Health Organization. It was over 20 times that level this week. Studies indicate that inhaling PM 2.5 can lead to cognitive impairment in children.  A costly escape  Some parents, like Deepthi Ramdas, prioritized their children’s health and relocated years ago. When her son Rudra was born three years ago, she did not think leaving Delhi would ever be on the cards. But that changed when she saw him admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in January 2022.  The doctors told her she should leave Delhi if she wanted her son’s lungs to develop, Deepthi recalled. Since she had family in the southern state of Kerala, she decided to go.  “It was not an easy decision. I had to quit my job which I loved… and because my husband had to continue to be in Delhi for work… we got into a long-distance marriage,” she said.  Deepthi Ramdas' son was hospitalized when he was less than a year old in 2022. “We keep this as a keepsake to remember one of his worst times yet,” she said. Deepthi Ramdas  But Deepthi finds relief in knowing Rudra has had no breathing issues in Kerala. They visited Delhi in the first week of December to meet their father. “We hoped since he is 3 now (that) his lungs would be stronger, but within a few days Rudra had an attack and was on nebulizers again,” Deepthi said.  “Looking at him like that was heartbreaking. There is no way I am moving back to Delhi,” she said, sharing pictures of Rudra from when he was in hospital in 2022 to him playing outdoors in Kerala in October.  Anxiety in the air  Many parents in Delhi are living under anxiety fueled by their inability to escape the city due to work and other commitments.  “This is not something you just do, you have to plan it, and be fortunate enough,” 29-year-old mother Urvee Parasramka told CNN. Her daughter Reva, 2, has been on nebulizers since her first winter, she said.  When Urvee was expecting, she recalls her husband, Prateek Tulsyan, responding to news of pollution by saying he’d ensure there were enough air purifiers at home to protect his child. However, nine months after delivery, Reva had her first attack.  “There was a lot of panic then. It was hard to understand why she even needed such heavy medication. I was very scared. It took me a while to come around,” Prateek told CNN.  Urvee added: “I am constantly checking her temperature, do not allow her to go out or eat anything that may exacerbate her condition. I am now an over-protective parent.”  If she hears Reva sneeze, she knows a cough is coming, followed by congestion and then the need for the nebulizer.  Urvee said they’ve decided to move to Guwahati, northeast India, where the air quality is better, during the high pollution months next year.  “I am born and brought up here, comfortable here, so to create another home there won’t be easy but we have no choice,” she said.  No way out  Muskan and her neighbors in the Delhi slum are not as fortunate.  She runs to the shared nebulizer when her children show symptoms like chest pain, coughing or vomiting. She says the children ask for it themselves and use it with practiced precision. But not everyone is able to afford to have the machine at home.  Some of her neighbors rush to the nearest private clinic and pay about 80 rupees or $1 for each treatment.  One of them is Deepak Kumar, a daily wage worker with four children. His youngest and only daughter, Kripa, 1, is using a nebulizer for the second consecutive winter season since her birth.  Deepak Kumar holds his daughter Kripa, 1, for whom he has had to take on debt to pay for urgent medical expenses. “If I put her down she starts crying,” he said. Aishwarya S Iyer/CNN  “The doctor asked us to buy it, but we do not have that kind of money,” he said.  One visit to the doctor costs more than his daily wage.  Nights are the worst. When there are no doctors available, he relies on balms and steam to help his daughter get through the night. Even when she is sleeping well, the mounting debt due to medical expenses keeps him awake.  “Yes, I am in debt of 20,000 rupees ($235) and to pay that off I am trying to work even harder,” he said.  Many like Kumar have come to Delhi from different parts of India to seek a better life, but they’re stuck.  “It should not be so hard to live in the capital,” he said."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/13/science/oldest-human-dna-neanderthal-ancestry/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Oldest human DNA helps pinpoint when early humans interbred with Neanderthals,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  Scientists say they have recovered the oldest known Homo sapiens DNA from human remains found in Europe, and the information is helping to reveal our species’ shared history with Neanderthals.  The ancient genomes sequenced from 13 bone fragments unearthed in a cave beneath a medieval castle in Ranis, Germany, belonged to six individuals, including a mother, daughter and distant cousins who lived in the region around 45,000 years ago, according to the study that published Thursday in the journal Nature.  The genomes carried evidence of Neanderthal ancestry. Researchers determined that the ancestors of those early humans who lived in Ranis and the surrounding area likely encountered and made babies with Neanderthals about 80 generations earlier, or 1,500 years earlier, although that interaction did not necessarily happen in the same place.  Scientists have known since the first Neanderthal genome was sequenced in 2010 that early humans interbred with Neanderthals, a bombshell revelation that bequeathed a genetic legacy still traceable in humans today.  However, exactly when, how often and where this critical and mysterious juncture in human history took place has been hard to pin down. Scientists have believed interspecies relations would have occurred somewhere in the Middle East as a wave of Homo sapiens left Africa and bumped into Neanderthals, who had lived across Eurasia for 250,000 years.  The cave where the ancient human remains were found is located beneath a castle in Ranis, Germany. Martin Schutt/picture alliance/Getty Images  A broader study on Neanderthal ancestry, published Thursday in the journal Science, that analyzed information from the genomes of 59 ancient humans and those of 275 living humans corroborated the more precise timeline, finding that the majority of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans can be attributed to a “single, shared extended period of gene flow.”  “We were far more similar than we were different,” Priya Moorjani, a senior author of the Science study and an assistant professor in the department of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, said at a news briefing.  “The differences that we imagined between these groups to be very big, actually, were very small, genetically speaking. They seem to have mixed with each other for a long period of time and were living side by side for a long period of time.”  The research pinpointed a pivotal period that began about 50,500 years ago and ended around 43,500 years ago — not long before the now extinct Neanderthals began to disappear from the archaeological record. Over this 7,000-year time frame, early humans encountered Neanderthals, had sex and gave birth to children on a fairly regular basis. The height of the activity was 47,000 years ago, the study suggested.  The research also showed how certain genetic variants inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors, which make up between 1% and 3% of our genomes today, varied over time. Some, such as those related to the immune system, were beneficial to humans as they lived through the last ice age, when temperatures were much cooler, and they continue to confer benefits today.  The two studies lend “substantial confidence” to the timing of when humans and Neanderthals exchanged genes, something geneticists describe as introgression, said evolutionary geneticist Tony Capra, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics in the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute at the University of California, San Francisco.  “Genetic data from this crucial period in our evolution are very rare,” said Capra, who wasn’t involved in the research, via email. “These studies underscore how having even a few ancient genomes provides powerful perspective that enabled the authors to refine our understanding of human migration and Neanderthal introgression.”  A skull found in Zlatý kůň in the Czech Republic contains DNA that linked the woman to the Ranis individuals. Marek Jantač  The scientists working on the two research projects decided to publish their work at the same time when they realized they had separately reached a similar conclusion.  How Neanderthal ancestry has shaped human genes  The research in Science found that genetic variants inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors are unevenly distributed across the human genome.  Some regions, which the scientists call “archaic deserts,” are devoid of Neanderthal genes. These deserts likely developed quickly after the two groups interbred, within 100 generations, perhaps because they resulted in birth defects or diseases that would have affected the survival chances of the offspring.  “It suggests that hybrid individuals who had Neanderthal DNA in these regions were substantially less fit, likely to due to severe disease, lethality, or infertility,” Capra said via email.  In particular, the X chromosome was a desert. Capra said the effects of Neanderthal variants that cause disease could be greater on the X chromosome, perhaps because it is present in two copies in females, but only present in one copy in males.  “The X chromosome also has many genes that are linked to male fertility when modified, so it has been proposed that some of this effect could have come from introgression leading to male hybrid sterility,” he said.  The Neanderthal gene variants detected most frequently in ancient and modern Homo sapiens genomes are related to traits and functions that included immune function, skin pigmentation and metabolism, with some increasing in frequency over time.  “Neanderthals were living outside Africa in harsh, ice age climates and were adapted to the climate and to the pathogens in these environments. When modern humans left Africa and interbred with Neanderthals, some individuals inherited Neanderthal genes that presumably allowed them to adapt and thrive better in the environment,” said Leonardo Iasi, co-lead author of the Science paper and a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.  The individuals living at Ranis had 2.9% Neanderthal ancestry, not dissimilar to most people today, the Nature study found.  The new timeline allows scientists to understand better when humans left Africa and migrated around the world. It suggested that the main wave of migration out of Africa was essentially done by 43,500 years ago because most humans outside Africa today have Neanderthal ancestry originating from this period, the Science study suggested.  However, there is still much scientists don’t know. It’s not clear why people in East Asia today have more Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans, or why Neanderthal genomes from this period show little evidence of Homo sapiens DNA.  While the genomes sequenced from the Ranis individuals are the oldest Homo sapiens ones, scientists have previously recovered and analyzed DNA from Neanderthal remains that date back 400,000 years.  Lost branch of the human family tree  The individuals who called the cave in Ranis home were among the first Homo sapiens to live in Europe.  These early Europeans numbered a few hundred and included a woman who lived 230 kilometers (143 miles) away in Zlatý kůň in the Czech Republic. DNA from her skull was sequenced in a previous study, and researchers involved in the Nature study were able to connect her to the Ranis individuals.  These individuals had dark skin, dark hair and brown eyes, according to the study, perhaps reflecting their relatively recent arrival from Africa. Scientists are continuing to study remains from the site to piece together their diet and how they lived.  The family group was part of a pioneer population that eventually died out, leaving no trace of ancestry in people alive today. Other lineages of ancient humans also went extinct around 40,000 years ago and disappeared just like the Neanderthals ultimately did, said Johannes Krause, director at the department of archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. These extinctions may suggest that Homo sapiens did not play a role in the demise of Homo neanderthalensis.  “It’s kind of interesting to see that human story is not always a story of success,” said Krause, a senior author of the Nature study."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/sport/lindsey-vonn-world-cup-skiing-return-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Lindsey Vonn to make World Cup skiing return in St. Moritz,"CNN —  Skiing great Lindsey Vonn has announced that she will make her World Cup return at St Moritz, Switzerland next weekend.  In a video posted by her sponsor, Red Bull, on Friday, the 40-year-old Vonn said: “So, I have some news. My body is finally put back together and I hear St Moritz is pretty nice this time of year.”  Vonn announced her retirement from competitive skiing in 2019 after 18 years on the World Cup circuit. In that time, she recorded 82 World Cup race wins, eight world championship medals and three Winter Olympic medals.  After undergoing successful partial knee replacement surgery earlier this year, the American star decided to return to ski racing.  “I feel stronger now than I did in my late 20s,” she said, per Reuters. “The passion for skiing has never gone away, I just wasn’t physically able to do it anymore.  “It was pretty soon after surgery and in the rehab process that I was already doing things that I hadn’t done in years,” she added.  “My body was just functioning better. Obviously, I am a lot happier because I’m not in pain 24 hours a day. I’m getting stronger and better and faster than I was for a long, long period of time.”  Vonn recently competed in lower-level events in Copper Mountain, Colorado in order to gain eligibility to compete at World Cup races.  According to The Associated Press, she will race in two super-G events in St. Moritz, where she has previously won five World Cup titles. The super-G competitions in the Swiss resort are scheduled to take place on December 21 and 22.  The US Ski Team confirmed to CNN that Vonn will compete in St. Moritz.  “One thing I realized is that life is really short,” Vonn said in the video posted by Red Bull. “If you have an opportunity, you have to take it. There’s nothing that I love more than ski racing.”  Vonn’s haul of 82 World Cup wins puts her third on the all-time list behind Sweden’s Ingemar Stenmark on 86 and compatriot Mikaela Shiffrin on 99."
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/christmas-railway-station-romance-chance-encounters/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,Her flight was delayed and she missed her train home for Christmas. Then she met her future husband on the platform,"CNN —  When frazzled twentysomething traveler Jennea arrived at London’s King’s Cross railway station on December 15, 2013, the station was absolutely packed.  Carol singers in one corner were singing with gusto, collecting money for charity in brightly colored buckets. Gathered in the middle of the Victorian concourse, crowds of travelers stood, wrapped in coats and scarfs, looking up at the departure boards, waiting for their platform to be announced.  Passengers jostled past each other, armed with bags of gifts and large suitcases. Exhausted and a little overwhelmed, Jennea still found time to be charmed by the festive atmosphere. She took a moment to put down her heavy bag and check the departure board, searching for her train.  Jennea, who’d grown up in the US, had spent the last 18 months in Mozambique, where she’d been volunteering for the US Peace Corps. She hadn’t seen her loved ones in almost two years, and now she was en route to reunite with them in Cambridge, England.  The thought of hugging her mom, catching up with her aunt and uncle and distributing her gifts to her family kept Jennea going as she hoisted her heavy backpack onto her back, and headed towards her platform.  “I was absolutely loaded down — two suitcases, a backpackers’ backpack, my handbag…” Jennea tells CNN Travel today. “It’s Christmastime. I’m packed to the brim with Christmas presents. Making my way through King’s Cross Station, completely absorbed.”  When Jennea got to the platform, it was unnervingly empty. This was surprising.  “I remember thinking, ‘This platform is very quiet. It’s so close to Christmas and it’s King’s Cross, that’s bizarre. I don’t even know if I’m in the right place. What if I’ve misread the platform number incorrectly?’”  Jennea glanced around for someone to ask. She couldn’t see a train guard or another passenger.  “And not only that, there were two trains on the platform as well.”  It wasn’t clear which was the right train.  Jennea felt herself start to panic. She was already leaving London much later than she’d initially planned. And she was exhausted from traveling from the Mozambique village where she was volunteering to Malawi, then to Kenya, then to the UK.  “It took four days,” Jennea recalls. “And even then, when I finally landed in London, there was this massive delay on the airplane.  “Because of this, I had missed my plan A train, my plan B train, my plan everything train… It was 2013 and I didn’t have an iPhone yet. I couldn’t get a hold of my aunt and uncle who were going to be picking me up.”  Just as Jennea felt the stress and tiredness start to overwhelm her, she heard a voice behind her.  “Excuse me, is this the train to Cambridge?”  A train station conversation  Jennea and Arthur immediately hit it off at King's Cross railway station in December 2013. Dreamcapture Fotografie  Jennea turned around and saw a man, also wrapped in a hat and scarf, but significantly less weighed down by luggage.  “I was so relieved,” recalls Jennea. “I replied, ‘Oh I hope it’s going to Cambridge. That’s where I’m going.’”  As she spoke, Jennea realized she hadn’t had a conversation in four days — other than perfunctory airport and airplane interactions. She felt a strange feeling of ease with this stranger, who smiled at her and offered to help her with her bags as they boarded the train together.  As Jennea apologized for the heaviness of her luggage and the guy told her not to worry about it, Jennea thought she detected something familiar in his voice.  “Are you American?” she asked.  “No, I’m Dutch,” he said, smiling. “But I live in London. I’m Arthur.”  “I’m Jennea,” said Jennea, smiling back.  In mutual, unspoken agreement, Jennea and Arthur — who have requested their last names not be included in this story for privacy reasons — sat down on the train, opposite one another. They carried on talking.  “It was just very easy conversation,” recalls Jennea.  The carriage gradually filled up, and an overhead announcement confirmed the train was heading to Cambridge.  Arthur asked Jennea what brought her to the UK, and Jennea explained her mother was Irish, that she had family in Ireland and the UK, and they were all gathering there for the festive period.  As for Arthur, he explained he’d moved to London for college a few years previously. He was currently working in finance while he studied part time for a PhD — and he wasn’t heading to Cambridge for the holidays, but for something a little more unusual.  “I’d been invited to go to Cambridge by a friend of mine who was a novice monk,” Arthur tells CNN Travel today. “He basically invited me to spend a few days as a mini retreat away from the Big Smoke.”  Arthur had approached Jennea on the platform because he was confused about the train.  “It was initially purely functional dialogue,” is how Arthur puts it. “Trying to get on the train, trying to get to Cambridge… but then it quickly morphed into a very easygoing conversation about lots of different topics. It felt like there was a lot of common ground.”  “People say, ‘Was it love at first sight?’” says Jennea, of that first interaction with Arthur. “And I say this lovingly, but no, no, it wasn’t. It was just relief: ‘Thank God there’s someone else on the platform.’ And then it was functional. ‘Okay, where am I going? What am I doing?’ But then we sat down, and started talking.”  For both Arthur and Jennea, this conversation was the hook. They were intrigued by each other. Arthur knew nothing about the Peace Corps. Jennea was fascinated by the idea of having a friend who was a monk. Their conversation just flowed.  As the train — now full of people — weaved its way through the series of tunnels that carry trains northward out of King’s Cross, Arthur and Jennea kept talking.  “There wasn’t that point where it became awkward and silent and you’re thinking, ‘Do I dig out my book and pretend to read now?’” says Jennea. “No. We chatted the entire time.”  About an hour later, the train pulled into Cambridge station, and Arthur helped Jennea gather her many bags. They exchanged details, promising to add one another on Facebook, and they were still deep in conversation as the train pulled to a halt.  “Then, as we stepped off onto the platform, my aunt and my uncle were actually right there, and I was so relieved because they’d waited for me,” says Jennea. “I hadn’t seen my family in years at this point, it had been a long time, so I just threw my arms around my uncle, and then my aunt.”  Meanwhile Arthur hung back, still holding Jennea’s suitcases.  “He was standing there with my bags — my aunt said, ‘Oh my gosh, look at you. You’ve gone all the way to Mozambique, and you’ve come back, and here’s a man standing with your bags. What have you done?’” recalls Jennea, laughing.  “It was kind of an, ‘Alright, bye,’ moment,” says Arthur, also laughing.  Arthur and Jennea didn’t hug farewell — they both suddenly felt a little awkward in that moment. But as they walked in opposite directions, they each turned around to smile at one another, and wave.  “I was sort of thinking, ‘Oh, that was really nice. What a great start to my Christmas holidays,’” recalls Jennea. “But I had no idea what would happen next.”  Staying in touch  Arthur and Jennea had lots in common from the outset and stayed in touch after their railway meeting. Arthur and Jennea  When Jennea got to her aunt’s house, she spent the next couple of hours catching up with her family, sharing stories of her mammoth journey and her work in Mozambique.  Later, when she finally connected to the Wi-Fi on her cell phone, Jennea saw she had a friend request from Arthur. She accepted, and he sent through a message right away, saying how great it was to meet her.  “And then we just kept exchanging Facebook messages back and forth over the holidays,” says Jennea. “I kept sneaking away into the room I was staying at my aunt’s house to try and message privately.”  Jennea and Arthur picked back up the conversation they’d started on the train, sending instant messages regularly back and forth. After a couple of days, they started talking on the phone.  A few days before Christmas, Jennea’s parents arrived in Cambridge.  “As soon as my mom arrived, my aunt said, ‘I think she’s met someone in the UK.’ And my mom was like, ‘Who did she meet? She’s only just landed?’” recalls Jenna. “And so then I always had a — very well-meaning, but nosy — relative, always coming into the bedroom, just putting laundry away, whenever I was on the phone with Arthur.”  “Which I would hear in the background, by the way, when we would be talking,” adds Arthur. “I’d suddenly hear, ‘Can you see me? I’m the pretty aunt.’”  Jennea was set to return to Mozambique early in the new year. She still had another 12 months of her Peace Corps contract. It wasn’t obvious where this connection with Arthur would or could go. But then Arthur invited Jennea to visit him in London for a couple of days before she returned.  “My mom was like, ‘Absolutely not. He could be an axe murderer. You just don’t know,’” says Jennea. “While my aunt was saying, ‘You’re just young once, and you only live once, so take a chance and see what happens.’”  Jennea tried not to be swayed by either of their opinions.  “I mean, as an adult, I was able to make my own decisions,” she points out.  Jennea knew she wanted to see Arthur again. So she got the train back from Cambridge to London, where Arthur was waiting, smiling, in the station concourse.  “We were in London together for just 24 hours,” says Arthur. “It was quite special. We were able to squeeze basically lots of different dates into that period of time.”  It was the end of December — that time between Christmas and the new year when many people in the UK are off work, the Christmas lights are still twinkling and there’s a sense of expectation in the air as January 31 gets ever closer. It was the perfect backdrop for falling in love.  “It was a very magical day,” says Jennea. “We went to different restaurants, museums, and saw a show.”  Arthur had planned out the whole day.  “And all the things that he had planned, they were things that I really enjoy doing as well,” says Jennea. “So there was this thought of, ‘What you like doing is what I like doing,.’”  “It was just one day in London. But it really sealed the deal.”  Arthur felt the same way, saying this time together, “helped establish a strong bond.”  But when Jennea left for Mozambique, she and Arthur promised to take “everything one day at a time.”  Neither of them had been looking for romance when they met. And both were conscious that Jennea living on another continent would be tough to navigate.  “My approach to it was, ‘If I keep talking to Arthur, that’s wonderful, and that’s great. And if not, I had a great time. Everything was lovely,’” says Jennea.  “And so I think because I wasn’t expecting and hoping and putting that pressure on, it always remained a very safe space, if that makes sense — super organic. It was just very relaxed, one day at a time without the pressure and I think the distance permitted that — but also knowing that the distance was temporary, I think that’s a really important mixture in starting a long-distance relationship.”  Jennea and Arthur kept in touch while she was away via regular phone calls.  “We would call and chat, building the relationship and getting to know each other,” says Jennea. “I looked forward to those phone calls. We’d ask: ‘What are your hopes and dreams for the future? What’s your family like? Do you have siblings? Happiest memory…’ That kind of thing… And also just, ‘How do you like your toast?’”  “Jennea was someone that liked going into depth on different things,” says Arthur. “And also someone I could laugh with. Someone with a sense of humor. I think that was very appealing.”  A few months in, Arthur visited Jennea in Mozambique in spring 2015.  “It was surreal when I saw Arthur again,” recalls Jennea. “I couldn’t believe he traveled across the world to come and visit me. I traveled six hours via public transport to meet him at the Nampula airport so it’s safe to say we were both feeling a little more invested in our relationship at that point.”  Jennea waited for Arthur at the airport holding “a giant homemade welcome sign for him in Dutch.”  The Mozambique visit was really exciting for both Arthur and Jennea, and further confirmed their certainty in the relationship and its potential future.  “It gave me a deep appreciation for the volunteering Jennea did, which really was a defining experience for her,” says Arthur.  And as the months rolled on, Jennea started considering what she’d do after her Peace Corps contract ended. She was interested in teaching, but wasn’t sure where she’d end up based.  “My original plan was to return to the US and to go into graduate school. And in the United States, you have to take an entrance exam in order to get into graduate school. So I convinced myself that it would be worth it to go to London and take this exam, because then I could stay with Arthur,” says Jennea.  In the moment, Jennea told herself — and everyone else in her life — that she was saving money by not having to pay for hotel accommodation, even though she could have done the exam somewhere closer and saved the plane fare.  “It was an excuse,” Jennea says. “I wasn’t fooling anyone. But then I went to London and stayed with Arthur for two weeks.”  During that period, Jennea talked to Arthur about her graduate school plans, and interest in teaching, but mentioned nothing was set in stone.  “I’m open to various options,” she told him.  “Well, you know, London is an option,” said Arthur.  Jennea raised an eyebrow, not sure what to make of this.  “I remember thinking, ‘What does that mean? I’m fully aware that I could move to London, but are you asking me to live with you?’” she says today. “And yes, that was his very romantic way of saying, ‘Will you live with me? London’s an option.’”  Life in London  After Jennea introduced Arthur to her extended family during a Minnesota-based Thanksgiving at the end of 2014 — a trip she calls “a lot of fun” — she made the choice to move to the UK to be with Arthur.  This decision was made a little easier thanks to Jennea’s mother’s Irish roots.  “Fortunately, I have dual-citizenship with Ireland and the USA,” she says. “I was therefore spared any visa hardships, luckily.”  And at the beginning of 2015, she moved into Arthur’s apartment in Poplar, east London — which he’d just purchased.  “The wallpaper was a bit 1970s, so we had this shared project of updating this flat together, and I think for us living together for the first time in this big city, and adjusting, it was helpful, because I wasn’t moving into his space right away. We were both starting out in this new space,” Jennea says.  “We were building new memories together, in a new area,” adds Arthur.  Jennea and Arthur moved in together in London in 2015. MoMi Photo  The couple also adopted a cat from Battersea Cats and Dogs Home, an animal rescue center in London.  “That was also really nice, because we had our little friend, and it was nice to come home to him,” says Jennea, who started training to become an elementary school teacher not long after she moved to the UK.  Life in London was an adjustment from her time in the Peace Corps — and living in the UK was also different from Jennea’s childhood in the US. But her Cambridge family weren’t too far away. And Jennea was excited to create her own family unit with Arthur.  “We were just very easy together,” she says. “It just felt cozy. It felt like home when we were together. I found security.”  When Jennea moved to London, she and Arthur and just celebrated their one year “meet-a-versary,” as she calls it.  As a gift, Arthur gave Jennea a ceramic tile, a type of traditional Dutch pottery, with a personalized inscription: “A phrase in Dutch that translates to, “The measurement of love is love without measurement.”  Underneath the words was the date Arthur and Jennea first met: December 15, 2013.  Proposal and marriage  Jennea and Arthur on their wedding day in Curacao. Arthur calls the day ""incredible and very memorable."" Claudia Sanches/Wow Wedding Details  After a couple of years enjoying London life, Arthur proposed to Jennea while they were on vacation in Bruges, Belgium.  “Arthur proposed after giving me a heartfelt letter about his love for me and got down on one knee,” says Jennea.  In the spring of 2017, Jennea and Arthur got married in Curacao, a Dutch Caribbean island.  “We chose a place that inconvenienced guests equally,” jokes Jennea before adding that they were attracted to the beauty of the island, and the fact it was “neither a ‘his’ nor ‘hers’ wedding destination.”  It was, says Arthur, “incredible and very memorable — having all of our closest family and friends in Curacao for a four day party.”  “For the entire week, when we walked down the street we always bumped into friends or family,” recalls Jennea.  “The day itself was sunny, clear blue skies and warm. I had had a sleepover with the bridesmaids/girls the night before and I was ready to party and say yes to living the rest of my life with Arthur by my side. It was just such a great buzz.”  The speeches included a couple of mentions of Arthur and Jennea’s unlikely train station meeting — including three of Arthur’s friends performing a little skit about the meeting, and the couple’s life together since.  “I have a lot of happy memories of that day. It’s definitely a moment in time I like to relive and enjoy,” says Jennea.  Arthur says he also felt “deeply happy” and also really “grateful” to be marrying Jennea.  Tougher times  From the early days of their relationship, Arthur and Jennea had talked about wanting children. The couple first discussed this mutual desire on one of their many long, in-depth cross-continental phone calls.  They figured once they were married, and more settled with careers and life, they’d start trying for kids.  “But this turned out to be very difficult,” says Jennea. “We really struggled with infertility, and that was something that was really hard, because everything else was so easy between us. When we started trying for kids, it just kind of felt ‘What’s wrong?’ This life we had envisioned together — it wasn’t necessarily clear whether or not we would ever have that.”  As the uncertainty and heartbreak stretched over several years, Jennea and Arthur navigated the ups and downs as a team.  “We’d be open about the challenges, having those conversations emotionally,” says Arthur. “But then also not being stuck in that anxiety or concern or frustration, but trying to convert that into, ‘Where do we go from here, together?’”  Arthur also credits the couple’s “wider social circle, family and friends” who helped support them through this period.  And then, in 2020, Jennea and Arthur had a successful round of IVF, welcoming a daughter.  “We got very lucky,” says Jennea.  A few years later, in summer 2023, the couple had a second child, a son.  “We have another little baby, also with the help of IVF,” says Jennea. “We just feel very fortunate to have what we have now.”  Life today  Jennea, Arthur and their two kids now live in the Netherlands. Arthur and Jennea  Today, Jennea and Arthur live in the Hague, in the Netherlands, with their two young children. The couple moved to Arthur’s home country when they became parents.  This was partly a career decision after Britain left the European Union, and partly a personal decision.  “Arthur’s career was moved from London to Amsterdam following Brexit, and then Arthur’s family also lives here,” explains Jennea. “So as I was pregnant and about to give birth, the thought was, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be nice to be closer to Arthur’s immediate family?’”  Today, says Jennea, the couple are nostalgic about their London life — “all the museums, going for drinks with your friends — there’s just so much going on in London, how could you not love it?”  They always enjoy returning — especially to King’s Cross station, where it all began.  “Kings Cross station definitely holds a special place in our hearts,” says Jennea. “We always hold hands and kiss when we walk through together. When we brought our daughter there the first time, that was a magical moment. I’m looking forward to bringing our son there in the future.”  It’s that wonderful festive energy, the exciting chaos, that engulfs the days leading up to Christmas that I associate with our love story. Jennea  Over a decade later, Jennea says she still thinks “meeting at a train station is romantic. It feels nostalgic in a way, like an old movie meet-cute.”  Jennea and Arthur also always associate the month of December with their love story.  “It’s that wonderful festive energy, the exciting chaos, that engulfs the days leading up to Christmas that I associate with our love story,” she says.  The couple always take a moment to “set aside time to be with just each other at this point in the year, and tell each other just how grateful we are that we met,” adds Jennea.  “To our friends/family, it has been compared to a Bollywood scene,” says Arthur, who adds he has a strong feeling that bumping into Jennea that day was “meant to be.”  “I honestly still count myself incredibly lucky because it was so serendipitous,” agrees Jennea.  “If things had gone to ‘plan’ — no delayed plane or luggage, not having missed my original trains to Cambridge, etc. I never would have met Arthur. Our paths just wouldn’t have crossed. We were living in two totally different worlds and this really feels like it was fate. Eleven years later, we’re still together and with two kids, all due to a chance encounter on a train platform.”"
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/science/december-full-moon/index.html,CNN,left,Japan,December full moon will shine bright this weekend. Here’s how to best view it,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  CNN —  As the winter nights grow longer, those in the Northern Hemisphere will want to keep an eye out this weekend for the last full moon of the year. The silvery orb will shine bright in the sky for a hair more than 16 hours on Saturday evening into Sunday morning.  Known as the long night moon or the cold moon, it’s set to reach peak illumination at 4:02 a.m. ET Sunday, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. However, the moon will appear round to the naked eye for about three days, according to NASA.  For those in the Southern Hemisphere, which had a long visibility moon in June, the December full moon will appear for a shorter time and will follow a lower arch in the sky, said Sara Russell, research scientist and head of the Planetary Materials Group at London’s Natural History Museum.  “For those of us in the northern hemisphere, the Moon will seem to reach higher in the sky than you might expect,” Russell said in an email.  The sun, moon and Earth are on about the same plane, with the full moon occurring when Earth is between the moon and the sun as the moon orbits our planet. “In December, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, the Sun is low and has a short track across the sky, so the opposite Moon has a high and long track,” Russell added.  Observing the cold moon  The cold moon’s name is a nod to the bitter weather typically found in the Northern Hemisphere this time of year. The name comes from the Mohawk people, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac, which has names for each full moon that historically derive from Native Americans, Colonial Americans or other sources.  For best viewing of the cold moon, Russell recommended looking when it has just risen or is about to set to see it near the horizon. Wrap up in warm layers if you’re in colder weather and aim to look when there are clear skies in your area, she said.  “We are so lucky on Earth to have the Moon. There’s nowhere else in our Solar system where there is a planet and moon so proportionately close in size — the Moon is almost like our smaller twin,” Russell said. “It is better at preserving all of its history than is the surface of the Earth, and we can look up to its cratered surface to see how battered by impacts both the Moon and Earth have been over their 4.5 billion-year history.”  Those observing the moon can ponder the questions yet to be answered about the neighboring celestial object, such as the mysteries surrounding the far side of the moon, theories about the water-rich lunar poles or the possibility of humans one day living on permanent bases there, Russell said.  Upcoming celestial events  This year, the December full moon occurs one week before the winter solstice, an astronomical event caused by the Earth’s tilt, that marks the Northern Hemisphere’s longest night and shortest day and vice versa for the Southern Hemisphere.  This year’s winter solstice, when Earth’s axis is tilted the farthest away from the sun, will be at 4:21 a.m. ET December 21, according to EarthSky.  The next full moon will be the wolf moon on January 25, according to the Farmers’ Almanac.  Meanwhile, there are two meteor showers to close out the year; the Geminids will be seen blazing in the night sky until the shower’s finality on December 21, while the Ursids will peak December 21-22, according to the American Meteor Society."

Left: Amazon MGM Studios; Right: Roadside Attractions  Unless folks are doing something like recording whole scenes of a movie on their cellphones, you generally don’t notice who else is in the audience with you at a movie theater. The lights fade to black, the screen brightens and everything — and everyone — around you virtually disappears. But sometimes taking stock of how others react to a film can tell you a lot about who becomes the arbiters of merit and why.  That’s especially true when you’re watching a Black movie.  An example that comes to mind is “12 Years a Slave,” which tells the harrowing true story of a free Black man who was abducted and sold into slavery in 1841. At a 2013 press screening for the film in Manhattan, an inclusive audience sat transfixed in front of the screen during multiple scenes of sexual and physical violence.  Advertisement  Perusing the theater during those moments revealed something interesting. Some Black viewers were stone-faced, while others seemed exhausted by the second or third brutality scene. Many of the white folks, though, were inconsolable — sobbing and blowing their noses. Perhaps that was on account of white guilt, a performative impulse, or because the film really is that stirring.  In any case, “12 Years a Slave,” a Steve McQueen-directed movie that unflinchingly portrays the horrors of white supremacy, was heralded by a predominantly white and so-called liberal Hollywood elite. And it went on to earn nine Oscar nominations.  There was another staggering Black drama released that same year that was also a nonfiction story dealing with systemic racism, though in a more modern context: “Fruitvale Station.” It earned exactly zero nominations from that same voting branch.  Advertisement  While the Ryan Coogler-directed film can hardly be accused of not engaging with the issue of whiteness through the lens of police brutality, there is a crucial difference between it and the aforementioned offering. It does not hinge on the racially motivated atrocity against its lead character or its perpetrator. Rather, it centers the Black human life that was cut short. It examines who the person was outside of the system of whiteness.  Ethan Herisse (left) and Brandon Wilson in ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  In essence, it’s not a film that necessarily brings white audiences into its story. It actually seems indifferent to whatever reaction they might have. A Hollywood voting establishment that, in spite of all its lip service, has always had an issue appreciating art that does not revolve around their lives or even their ills could see that as a detriment.  Advertisement  They often look for art they can laud that can at least give the appearance that they’re progressive despite showing all signs of the opposite. It’s a self-gratifying tactic that doesn’t serve the art at all, no matter how good it is.  It’s been over a decade since “12 Years a Slave” and “Fruitvale Station” were released, and white people’s proximity to a Black narrative still weighs heavily on their acclaim for it. This year’s “Nickel Boys” and “Exhibiting Forgiveness” are two other Black films that have had parallel journeys to the big screen and awards season. But their trajectories could not be more different — and for the same reason as their predecessors.  Similar to “12 Years a Slave,” “Nickel Boys,” an adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, is an unrelenting drama following the lives of two young Black men trying to survive an abusive and racist reform school in the 1960s. The performances are good. The movie’s technical merit, including its marvelous cinematography, has already helped it earn the attention of several awards bodies.  Advertisement  Despite it not even being released in limited theaters until Friday, there’s hardly a day that goes by in the last few months — since its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival this summer — that there isn’t press or hype about it. That includes numerous press screenings and initiatives.  But with the effects of systemic oppression being an impeding factor of the story, leaving little space to explore the characters’ humanity, it’s hard not to again wonder whether its appeal to arbitrated audiences is also that it is more for them to appreciate than others who might identify with their experiences.  André Holland (left) and Andra Day in ""Exhibiting Forgiveness."" Courtesy of Roadside Attractions  Advertisement  Director RaMell Ross said he didn’t intend for that to be the case, though. When the filmmaker was asked in an interview with Vanity Fair what his expectations are of audiences that are “older, very white and wealthier,” he replied that “Nickel Boys” “emerges from our centrality, and it ostensibly is for us, but I’m happy to give it to others.”  “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” on the other hand, doesn’t provoke that same question. It almost entirely wrestles with the complexities of its Black characters, and in ways Black audiences especially recognize. Systemic prejudices are understood as the reality in which they live, only because they are Black and it’s set in the present day, not because the plot informs that. There’s nary a moment when the film even gestures toward that to tell its story.  That helps create an intensely insulated film that centers a Black family whose drama is also deeply felt and astoundingly performed. The conflicts, joy and contradictions that propel the plot are of their own making — and not the result of a racially motivated antagonist. White people, come to think of it, are merely ornamental in the story.  Advertisement  It is unequivocally a film by and for Black people to grapple with among ourselves — one that has similarly affected Black audiences in the way “12 Years a Slave” moved white viewers. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” allows white audiences to enter its narrative incidentally only, while films like “Nickel Boys” and “12 Years a Slave” often engage directly with their white audiences through their own historical (and present-day) examination.  It’s a distinction that often results in the latter films being considered worthy of Hollywood’s highest honors.  Taking a look at the theatrical and post-theatrical odysseys of “Exhibiting Forgiveness” and “Nickel Boys” might help bring this into further focus. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is an original story that was amazingly green-lit in our sequel- and adaptation-obsessed culture and based on the personal experiences of writer-director Titus Kaphar, a first-time feature filmmaker.  Advertisement  “Nickel Boys” came with all the fanfare of a known author, an acclaimed literary honor under its belt and at least the assumption that its Jim Crow-era setting means that whiteness could obviously play a significant role in the story. Even Ross’ avant-garde filmmaking that shifts the camera and perspective between the two lead characters couldn’t deter an audience that was already locked in.  Herisse stars as Elwood in a moment from ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  Ross also told Vanity Fair that the process between the film being green-lit and going into production through Orion Pictures and Amazon MGM Studios was fairly smooth, to his own surprise. And since its Telluride premiere just a few months ago, “Nickel Boys” has experienced a constant whirlwind of praise from various awards bodies and audiences.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, Kaphar told me during an interview that “it was a fight” to get “Exhibiting Forgiveness” released in theaters. Like many filmmakers, especially Black filmmakers whose work is too often considered niche, Kaphar was approached about bringing the film to a streaming service.  Despite earning rave reviews following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it went months without being acquired, and then months later — not until October — it was released by Roadside Attractions. By then, many people had forgotten about it or just hadn’t heard much about it at all.  Save from a video-on-demand release and awards screeners available to voting press, the film hasn’t been able to achieve any major award nominations and hasn’t popped up on most “best of 2024” lists. (It made HuffPost’s roundup.) Unlike “Fruitvale Station,” it also failed to earn an Independent Spirit Award nomination or other award precursor nominations.  Advertisement  None of this discussion is to elevate any one Black film above another, suggest that a certain kind of Black film is better than the next, or even pit two films against each other. Both can and should be in the conversation. It is to question the deciding bodies that dictate the merit of Black films and have an honest conversation about what actually motivates their choices."

(Don't Be Embarrassed, It's Normal.)","Cavan Images via Getty Images Flatulence from your vagina during sex or physical activities like yoga is common and nothing to be ashamed of.  Queefing, as anyone with a vagina will tell you, can happen at some inopportune times: while you’re having sex, in the middle of a yoga class or during a visit to the gynecologist.  You may have heard some people refer to queefs as “vaginal farts” (charming). But while queefs do produce a toot-like sound, we can assure you that queefing is not the same as passing gas.  Advertisement  We talked to gynecologists and sex therapists to learn more about what causes queefs, some of the misconceptions about them and why they shouldn’t be as mortifying as we make them out to be.  What makes you queef, anyway?  Queefing is an involuntary bodily function that occurs when air is pushed into the vagina, gets temporarily trapped in the folds of the vaginal canal (called rugae) and is then released.  Advertisement  “Queefing happens when a penis, fingers or sex toy go in and out of the vagina bringing additional air along with it,” Sherry A. Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, California and the author of “She-ology: The Definitive Guide to Women’s Intimate Health,” told HuffPost. “Sex can involve a lot of thrusting of the penis in and out of the vagina, typically pushing extra air into a dead-end space.”  Certain sex positions, like doggy style where your pelvis is titled upwards, or abruptly switching from one position to another, may increase the likelihood of queefing. Even non-sexual activities, like putting in a tampon or menstrual cup, practicing yoga (like when you move out of an inversion pose) or your gyno inserting a speculum can lead to queefing.  “From my experience as an OB-GYN, almost every woman has experienced at least one episode of queefing some time during her life, sometimes even during a pelvic exam,” said Diana Hoppe, an OB-GYN in Encinitas, California.  While the gas that comes out of your rectum may have a foul odor (a result of bacterial activity in the gut), queefs are odorless, Hoppe added.  Advertisement  Can you prevent a queef?  And as OB-GYN Sheila Loanzon told Cosmopolitan, “If you try to contract the vaginal canal to prevent air from coming in, it can cause sex to be more painful.”  Advertisement  “Also, when doing any abdominal exercises or weight-bearing exercise, it is important to squeeze the pelvic floor while holding the core abdominal muscles tight,” Hoppe said. “Many women squeeze abdominal muscles but do not activate the pelvic floor at the same time, thus allowing the pelvic floor to sag, increasing the likelihood of air entering into vaginal canal.”  During sex, keeping the penis, fingers or sex toy inside you while you change positions could lessen your chances of queefing because it “gives air less of an opportunity to get into the vagina,” Jamil Abdur-Rahman, an OB-GYN and the chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vista Health System in Waukegan, Illinois, told Self.  Advertisement  And in theory, you could just avoid certain sex or yoga positions altogether. But what’s the fun in that?  When queefing does happen, don’t sweat it.  So why does this very normal bodily function feel so embarrassing in the moment, be it during doggy-style or downward dog? It really just comes down to that pesky noise, Hoppe said.  “The stigma is due to lack of understanding the difference between release of air from the vagina and flatulence,” she said. “The sound effects may be the same though, so culturally there may be a stigma or embarrassment due to this occurring ‘down there.’”  Advertisement  Sex therapist Vanessa Marin underscored the fact that queefing is normal, common and “not anything to be ashamed of.” Embracing the awkwardness of the moment can even make sex more enjoyable for both partners.  “Our bodies make funny noises sometimes, and that’s OK!” she said. “Plus, there are plenty of other goofy things about sex, like getting sweaty, slipping out, getting into awkward positions and so on. The more we can laugh about these kinds of things, the more fun we’ll have during sex.”  When a queef slips out mid-coitus, you have two choices: ignore that deflating balloon sound completely or quickly acknowledge it and move on. Marin prefers the latter route.  Advertisement  “It’s a personal preference, but I think it’s better to just quickly acknowledge it and laugh it off,” she said. “That way you don’t have to sit there thinking about it, anxiously wondering whether or not your partner heard it.”  Is queefing ever cause for concern?  Generally, queefing is nothing to be worried about. While rare, if queefing is accompanied by pain or a bad smell, you should make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any more serious issues.  “If queefing is associated with a foul odor, it may be an indication of a vaginal infection or possible fistula, an [abnormal] connection between rectum and vagina due to previous radiation treatment or surgery that causes stool or feces to come out of the vagina,” Hoppe said.  Advertisement  But for the most part, queefing is a normal, if slightly awkward, fact of life. So let’s not get so hung up on it, OK?"

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.

At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep.

The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.

Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

(AP) — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.  Advertisement  This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what’s behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  More drone sightings have been reported in New York City, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials. And then President-elect Donald Trump posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  This photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. (Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.  Advertisement  “Whether or not it’s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I’m saying is it’s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,” he added.  ___"

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

If you’re an avid traveler, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your passport fill up with stamps, turning that once-blank travel document into a nostalgic little memory book.  But as delightful as it is to have a paper trail of evidence of your past adventures, your large stamp collection could lead to issues on future trips if you don’t pay close attention. That’s all due to a passport validity rule that many people overlook.  Advertisement  “One rule many travelers miss is needing an adequate number of blank pages in their passport for visas, and entry and exit stamps,” David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com, told HuffPost. “This is often forgotten, especially by those with passports close to expiring or having only a few blank pages.”  The U.S. State Department did not set the blank pages rule, which stems from other countries’ requirements for international visitors.  “Some countries require passports to have at least two to four blank visa or stamp pages, and thus, some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met,” said Caroline Tanner, a trends writer at The Points Guy.  Advertisement  Just as travelers often need to have at least three to six months of passport validity beyond the dates of an international trip, they may also need to have a certain number of empty pages depending on the requirements at their destination.  “The basis for this rule is maintaining proper security measures and part of the entry and exit requirements,” Alwadish said. “Not meeting this requirement can cause problems at borders. If the traveler does not have the required blank pages in the passport, the passport will technically be invalid and the person may not be allowed to board the plane.”  He emphasized that airlines can bar passengers who do not meet the requirement from boarding their flights to avoid complications at the international destination.  Advertisement  “If for whatever reason it is overlooked in the U.S., the traveler may take a big risk once they arrive at their destination country, as every border patrol officer has the right to determine the outcome,” Alwadish explained. “They may have travelers detained, pay a fine or let them pass.”  Taking that kind of risk in a foreign country is not advisable, he added. And there’s a long list of countries that have this rule in place. Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Germany, India, Belgium, South Africa, the Netherlands, Cuba, Iceland, Zimbabwe and Indonesia are among the destinations that require two blank pages. Countries that require one page include France, Japan, Mexico, Greece, Thailand, Australia, Morocco, Argentina and Vietnam, among others. But you’ll need at least three blank pages if you want to visit Namibia, Botswana, Madagascar and Zambia.  “While some pages may be full of stamps, others might have one ― and just one stamp means that that page is not empty,” Alwadish cautioned.  Advertisement  Immigration authorities in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have also emphasized that the “endorsement” pages found at the back of many passports are different from visa pages and thus do not count as blank pages for the purposes of entry and exit stamps. (Newer passports have the endorsement section closer to the front.)  Meanwhile, Armenia and Micronesia have no stated blank passport page requirements.  “Countries like Sweden and the Philippines don’t require a blank page on your passport, but rather sufficient space for entry and exit stamps,” Alwadish noted.  He recommended looking at the State Department’s website for a breakdown of the specific entry prerequisites for each country.  Advertisement  Jake Wyman via Getty Images Many avid travelers delight in their extensive collections of passport stamps, but it's important to check the blank page requirements before visiting an international destination.  Keep in mind that blank page rules don’t just apply to U.S. visitors, either.  “This is true for all incoming travelers to the country, regardless of nationality, based on requirements set by individual countries for incoming visitors,” Tanner said.  Over time, frequent travelers may not need to worry as much about having enough empty passport pages.  Advertisement  “The issue of blank passport pages will likely become less of a significant problem for travelers as more countries are phasing out manual stamping of physical passport books,” Alwadish said. “The European Union is spearheading this shift with the introduction of the Entry/Exit System, intended to expedite the border control process and improve data accuracy.”  He explained that this new system uses biometric technology to scan travelers’ fingerprints and faces at border checkpoints.  “This data will then be stored and used to verify their arrival and exits, cross referenced with their passport information, removing the necessity for physical passport stamps,” he said.  Advertisement  But for now, immigration officers still need to ensure there are enough pages for stamps and visas. So travelers must remain vigilant.  “It is always best to make sure your passport is valid and has at least two blank pages,” Alwadish noted. “If a traveler does not have enough blank pages available, they cannot add more to their physical book.”  As of 2016, the U.S. government does not allow travelers to add extra pages to their existing passports. If they need more pages, they must renew their passports.  Advertisement  People who often travel internationally might want to consider choosing the option for a bigger passport with more visa pages. It’s no extra cost, and all you have to do is check the box that says “large book” when you fill out the form.  If you have an impending trip abroad, there are ways to get a new passport in a rush on your own or by paying a third party for expedited service. And of course, the best way to avoid adding extra stress and hassle is to keep track of your passport and ensure it’s compliant throughout the year."

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

(AP Photo/Zurab Tsertsvadze) via Associated Press  Who is the outgoing president?  Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.

Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia’s opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.

Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads. Try and win an argument with any woman in Canada,” he said. “We’re pretty tough and resilient people.”"

(South Korean Presidential Office/Yonhap via AP) via AP  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s parliament on Saturday impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his stunning and short-lived martial law decree, a move that ended days of political paralysis but set up an intense debate over Yoon’s fate, as jubilant crowds roared to celebrate another defiant moment in the country’s resilient democracy.  The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85. Yoon’s presidential powers and duties were subsequently suspended and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s No. 2 official, took over presidential powers later Saturday.  Advertisement  The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he’s thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon’s impeachment after ruling party lawmakers boycotted it last Saturday. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon’s impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon’s impeachment was an outcome driven by “the people’s ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.”  Advertisement  Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, “We have preserved the constitutional order!”  In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached. Both rallies have largely been peaceful.

(AP Photo/Ahnn Young-joon) Ahn Young-joon via AP  The new leader bolsters the country’s security posture  Yoon issued a statement saying he would “never give up” and calling for officials to maintain stability in government functions during what he described as a “temporary” pause of his presidency.  “I will carry with me all the criticisms, encouragement and support directed toward me, and I will continue to do my utmost for the country until the very last moment,” Yoon said.  Advertisement  Han, who became the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han’s office.  South Korea’s executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade and finance and was the ambassador to the U.S. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.  Advertisement  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred.  Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law.  The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon “committed rebellion that hurts peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.” It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.  Advertisement  Yoon remains defiant  In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon had rejected the rebellion charges, calling his order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it “a monster” and “anti-state forces” that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.  Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a “mad declaration of war” against his own people.  Observers say Yoon’s speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon’s approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.  Advertisement  Some of Yoon’s claims don’t align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.  Most notably, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that after martial law was announced, Yoon called him and asked for his troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he didn’t carry out Yoon’s orders.  Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.  Advertisement  In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers. Roh jumped to his death in 2009, after he had left office, amid a corruption scandal involving his family.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea.  He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations."

Mangione has hired Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who for years worked in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office under Cyrus Vance Jr. before going into the private sector, to represent him in New York, as CNN first reported Friday and other outlets have since corroborated.  Advertisement  The shooting suspect remains in custody in Pennsylvania after his arrest there on charges such as forgery and illegal possession of a firearm. He is fighting extradition to New York, where he has been charged with second-degree murder.  HuffPost has reached out to Friedman Agnifilo for comment.  The news comes as officials say they have found new evidence in the case, with New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch stating that a 3D-printed gun Mangione possessed at the time of his Pennsylvania arrest matched three shell casings recovered at the Manhattan shooting scene.  His fingerprints also matched those that investigators found on a water bottle and granola bar wrapper located near the scene, police said.  Advertisement  Jennifer Rodgers, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, on Friday described Friedman Agnifilo as the “sort of person you want” to take on the case.  “What you want is a lawyer who can take you through the real case,” Rodgers told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, adding that “Karen is the sort of person with all of her many years of experience as a trial lawyer and in this actual courthouse and in this actual office.”  Friedman Agnifilo — in a CNN appearance Tuesday, before she was retained — predicted that there could be a “not guilty by reason of insanity” defense in the case, as the evidence is “going to be so overwhelming that he [the suspect] did what he did.”  Advertisement  “As a former prosecutor in that [Manhattan District Attorney’s Office] ... I would be concerned that you have someone who is a valedictorian of his class. He was brilliant his whole life. He comes from this great family. I mean, something changed, right? Significantly, something changed,” she said.  “And they’re going to, I think, potentially have a ‘not guilty by reason of insanity’ potential defense. So the prosecutors are going to try to shore that up as well in their investigation.”  Advertisement  Thomas Dickey, Mangione’s lawyer in Pennsylvania, has said that his client plans to plead not guilty in that state. Dickey said this week that he hadn’t yet seen evidence that would implicate his client  “I don’t even know if this is him or whatever,” Dickey said on Tuesday."

Mark Warner (D-Va.) said Monday at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit.  Advertisement  Warner said he wanted to know about Gabbard’s “interchange with Assad and seeming affinity for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” as well as her support for intel whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.  The Assad linkage is so widely discussed that Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to Mike Pence during his vice presidency, made a cutting joke on a Sunday morning political talk show, saying that the three people most worried by Assad’s recent downfall were “Putin, the ayatollah [of Iran] and Tulsi Gabbard.”  Gabbard, who was a member of Congress from 2013 to 2021, traveled to Syria in 2017 to meet with Assad in a trip that raised eyebrows.  Advertisement  After inheriting leadership of his country from his father, Assad was known for being a particularly brutal and corrupt dictator, even by Middle East standards. In 2013, his forces were accused of using sarin gas in an attack killing 1,400 people and of using barrel bombs — explosives that can be made from empty barrels and other scrap, along with gasoline and shrapnel — against civilians. His government’s expertise in torture led the U.S. to outsource interrogations of some terrorism suspects there during President George W. Bush’s “global war on terror.”  In the wake of Assad’s fall, some of the costs of his rule have come to light, with journalists documenting his fancy car collection and the release of people kept in the brutal Saydnaya prison.  Freedom House, a democracy advocacy group, gave Syria a score of only 1 out of 100 in its 2024 ranking of countries by how free they are, ahead of only Tibet and Nagorno-Karabakh (which Freedom House includes as disputed territories).  Advertisement  After her 2017 trip, Gabbard defended herself, saying any peace deal amid Syria’s civil war would need Assad’s sign-off.  “Whatever you think about President Assad, the fact is that he is the president of Syria,” she said then.  That changed over the weekend, when Assad fled the country and received asylum in Russia under the protection of fellow strongman Putin. His fall ended more than 50 years of family rule after a stunning 11-day rebel advance.  Advertisement  During her time in the House of Representatives, Gabbard often justified a light touch with Assad by citing the threat of victory by Islamic militants, who were among the rival factions challenging his governance in the civil war. That stance also seemed to conveniently diminish Assad’s culpability for likely war crimes.  “Let the Syrian people themselves determine their future, not the United States, not some foreign country,” she told CNN in 2017.  While the group that led the rebel coalition to take down Assad, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government and has been affiliated with al Qaeda in the past, the opening days of post-Assad Syria have not seen the fundamentalist Islamic crackdown some had feared.  Advertisement  On Monday, Gabbard told reporters that her views now aligned with Trump’s, who’s commented on Assad’s fall by saying that the U.S. should not get involved — an option that virtually no one had suggested.  “I stand in full support and wholeheartedly agree with the statements that President Trump has made over these last few days with regards to the developments in Syria,” Gabbard stated.  Here are some of the things Gabbard had said on the floor of the House, or later inserted as written statements in the Congressional Record, on the need to keep Assad from being toppled and what would happen after his fall:  Advertisement  May 2018  In advocating for removing language in an annual defense policy bill that approved developing a strategy to counter Iran, Gabbard said, “It’s clear that, if left unchecked, war hawks in the Trump administration will drag our country into more Middle East wars, leaving destruction in its wake around the world and here at home.”  She added: “So what’s the objective of this authorization for war? Is it regime change in Iran? Regime change in Syria? More war against Iran and Syria? Yemen?”  December 2016  Talking about her bill to prohibit the government from supporting foreign terror groups, Gabbard said the U.S. had for years been “directly and indirectly supporting allies and partners of groups like al Qaeda and ISIS with money, weapons, intelligence and other support in their fight to overthrow the Syrian government.”  Advertisement  “The Wall Street Journal reports that rebel groups are, quote, ‘doubling down on their alliance’ with al Qaeda. This alliance has rendered the phrase ‘moderate rebels’ meaningless. We must stop this madness,” she said.  June 2016  Speaking of a provision to equip and train rebel Syrian groups in a defense funding bill, Gabbard said the groups remained focused on overthrowing Assad, which would end up “creating an even worse humanitarian crisis and an even greater threat to the world.”  “We’re waging two wars in Syria, providing arms and support to groups that have opposing objectives,” she said. “The first war is a counterproductive one to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad, which must end. And the second is our war to defeat ISIS, al Qaeda and other jihadist groups, which we must win. By helping groups fighting to overthrow Assad, we’re essentially helping ISIS and al Qaeda achieve their objective of taking over all of Syria.”  Advertisement  March 2016  In discussing one of two Syria-related resolutions, Gabbard called it “a thinly veiled attempt to use the rationale of humanitarianism as a justification for overthrowing the Syrian government of Assad.”  “If the U.S. is successful in its current effort to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad, allowing groups like ISIS and al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations to take over all of Syria, which is what will happen, including those Assad-controlled areas where Christians and other religious minorities remain protected, the United States will be morally culpable for the genocide that will occur as a result,” she said.  “This is exactly what happened when we overthrew Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It is what happened in Libya when we overthrew Muammar Gaddafi. To do the same thing over and over and expect a different result is the definition of insanity.”  Advertisement  March 2016  In discussing another resolution, Gabbard said she objected specifically to language saying that “Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s violence against the Syrian people has attracted foreign fighters from around the world, who have supported and committed ISIL [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant] atrocities.”  “I fully reject this amendment to the resolution which gives moral legitimacy to the actions of ISIS, al-Qaeda, and others who are committing genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities in Syria,” she said.  December 2014  In debating an annual defense policy bill, Gabbard said a provision to train what were described as “moderate” Syrian rebels “seriously polluted this critical piece of legislation.”  Advertisement  “I could not in good conscience vote to support the so-called moderate forces who often work hand in hand with al Qaeda or ISIS, and whose personnel and weapons often end up in the hands of those terrorists,” she said. “This bill continues the same failed practices of undeclared war, regime change and nation-building that have held us mired in the Middle East for over a decade.”  September 2014  In debating an amendment to a stopgap spending bill to aid Syrian opposition, Gabbard said, “Voting to support this proposal is actually a vote to overthrow Assad because overthrowing Assad is the primary objective of the so-called Free Syrian Army.”  She added: “If we combine the missions of destroying ISIL and of overthrowing Assad, this is not a smart or effective strategy for a number of reasons. We must focus on one mission — to destroy ISIL and other Islamic extremists who’ve declared war on us. Our mission should not be to topple the Assad regime, which would make the situation in the region even worse and more unstable than it is today.”"

Left: Amazon MGM Studios; Right: Roadside Attractions  Unless folks are doing something like recording whole scenes of a movie on their cellphones, you generally don’t notice who else is in the audience with you at a movie theater. The lights fade to black, the screen brightens and everything — and everyone — around you virtually disappears. But sometimes taking stock of how others react to a film can tell you a lot about who becomes the arbiters of merit and why.  That’s especially true when you’re watching a Black movie.  An example that comes to mind is “12 Years a Slave,” which tells the harrowing true story of a free Black man who was abducted and sold into slavery in 1841. At a 2013 press screening for the film in Manhattan, an inclusive audience sat transfixed in front of the screen during multiple scenes of sexual and physical violence.  Advertisement  Perusing the theater during those moments revealed something interesting. Some Black viewers were stone-faced, while others seemed exhausted by the second or third brutality scene. Many of the white folks, though, were inconsolable — sobbing and blowing their noses. Perhaps that was on account of white guilt, a performative impulse, or because the film really is that stirring.  In any case, “12 Years a Slave,” a Steve McQueen-directed movie that unflinchingly portrays the horrors of white supremacy, was heralded by a predominantly white and so-called liberal Hollywood elite. And it went on to earn nine Oscar nominations.  There was another staggering Black drama released that same year that was also a nonfiction story dealing with systemic racism, though in a more modern context: “Fruitvale Station.” It earned exactly zero nominations from that same voting branch.  Advertisement  While the Ryan Coogler-directed film can hardly be accused of not engaging with the issue of whiteness through the lens of police brutality, there is a crucial difference between it and the aforementioned offering. It does not hinge on the racially motivated atrocity against its lead character or its perpetrator. Rather, it centers the Black human life that was cut short. It examines who the person was outside of the system of whiteness.  Ethan Herisse (left) and Brandon Wilson in ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  In essence, it’s not a film that necessarily brings white audiences into its story. It actually seems indifferent to whatever reaction they might have. A Hollywood voting establishment that, in spite of all its lip service, has always had an issue appreciating art that does not revolve around their lives or even their ills could see that as a detriment.  Advertisement  They often look for art they can laud that can at least give the appearance that they’re progressive despite showing all signs of the opposite. It’s a self-gratifying tactic that doesn’t serve the art at all, no matter how good it is.  It’s been over a decade since “12 Years a Slave” and “Fruitvale Station” were released, and white people’s proximity to a Black narrative still weighs heavily on their acclaim for it. This year’s “Nickel Boys” and “Exhibiting Forgiveness” are two other Black films that have had parallel journeys to the big screen and awards season. But their trajectories could not be more different — and for the same reason as their predecessors.  Similar to “12 Years a Slave,” “Nickel Boys,” an adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, is an unrelenting drama following the lives of two young Black men trying to survive an abusive and racist reform school in the 1960s. The performances are good. The movie’s technical merit, including its marvelous cinematography, has already helped it earn the attention of several awards bodies.  Advertisement  Despite it not even being released in limited theaters until Friday, there’s hardly a day that goes by in the last few months — since its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival this summer — that there isn’t press or hype about it. That includes numerous press screenings and initiatives.  But with the effects of systemic oppression being an impeding factor of the story, leaving little space to explore the characters’ humanity, it’s hard not to again wonder whether its appeal to arbitrated audiences is also that it is more for them to appreciate than others who might identify with their experiences.  André Holland (left) and Andra Day in ""Exhibiting Forgiveness."" Courtesy of Roadside Attractions  Advertisement  Director RaMell Ross said he didn’t intend for that to be the case, though. When the filmmaker was asked in an interview with Vanity Fair what his expectations are of audiences that are “older, very white and wealthier,” he replied that “Nickel Boys” “emerges from our centrality, and it ostensibly is for us, but I’m happy to give it to others.”  “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” on the other hand, doesn’t provoke that same question. It almost entirely wrestles with the complexities of its Black characters, and in ways Black audiences especially recognize. Systemic prejudices are understood as the reality in which they live, only because they are Black and it’s set in the present day, not because the plot informs that. There’s nary a moment when the film even gestures toward that to tell its story.  That helps create an intensely insulated film that centers a Black family whose drama is also deeply felt and astoundingly performed. The conflicts, joy and contradictions that propel the plot are of their own making — and not the result of a racially motivated antagonist. White people, come to think of it, are merely ornamental in the story.  Advertisement  It is unequivocally a film by and for Black people to grapple with among ourselves — one that has similarly affected Black audiences in the way “12 Years a Slave” moved white viewers. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” allows white audiences to enter its narrative incidentally only, while films like “Nickel Boys” and “12 Years a Slave” often engage directly with their white audiences through their own historical (and present-day) examination.  It’s a distinction that often results in the latter films being considered worthy of Hollywood’s highest honors.  Taking a look at the theatrical and post-theatrical odysseys of “Exhibiting Forgiveness” and “Nickel Boys” might help bring this into further focus. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is an original story that was amazingly green-lit in our sequel- and adaptation-obsessed culture and based on the personal experiences of writer-director Titus Kaphar, a first-time feature filmmaker.  Advertisement  “Nickel Boys” came with all the fanfare of a known author, an acclaimed literary honor under its belt and at least the assumption that its Jim Crow-era setting means that whiteness could obviously play a significant role in the story. Even Ross’ avant-garde filmmaking that shifts the camera and perspective between the two lead characters couldn’t deter an audience that was already locked in.  Herisse stars as Elwood in a moment from ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  Ross also told Vanity Fair that the process between the film being green-lit and going into production through Orion Pictures and Amazon MGM Studios was fairly smooth, to his own surprise. And since its Telluride premiere just a few months ago, “Nickel Boys” has experienced a constant whirlwind of praise from various awards bodies and audiences.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, Kaphar told me during an interview that “it was a fight” to get “Exhibiting Forgiveness” released in theaters. Like many filmmakers, especially Black filmmakers whose work is too often considered niche, Kaphar was approached about bringing the film to a streaming service.  Despite earning rave reviews following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it went months without being acquired, and then months later — not until October — it was released by Roadside Attractions. By then, many people had forgotten about it or just hadn’t heard much about it at all.  Save from a video-on-demand release and awards screeners available to voting press, the film hasn’t been able to achieve any major award nominations and hasn’t popped up on most “best of 2024” lists. (It made HuffPost’s roundup.) Unlike “Fruitvale Station,” it also failed to earn an Independent Spirit Award nomination or other award precursor nominations.  Advertisement  None of this discussion is to elevate any one Black film above another, suggest that a certain kind of Black film is better than the next, or even pit two films against each other. Both can and should be in the conversation. It is to question the deciding bodies that dictate the merit of Black films and have an honest conversation about what actually motivates their choices."

(Don't Be Embarrassed, It's Normal.)","Cavan Images via Getty Images Flatulence from your vagina during sex or physical activities like yoga is common and nothing to be ashamed of.  Queefing, as anyone with a vagina will tell you, can happen at some inopportune times: while you’re having sex, in the middle of a yoga class or during a visit to the gynecologist.  You may have heard some people refer to queefs as “vaginal farts” (charming). But while queefs do produce a toot-like sound, we can assure you that queefing is not the same as passing gas.  Advertisement  We talked to gynecologists and sex therapists to learn more about what causes queefs, some of the misconceptions about them and why they shouldn’t be as mortifying as we make them out to be.  What makes you queef, anyway?  Queefing is an involuntary bodily function that occurs when air is pushed into the vagina, gets temporarily trapped in the folds of the vaginal canal (called rugae) and is then released.  Advertisement  “Queefing happens when a penis, fingers or sex toy go in and out of the vagina bringing additional air along with it,” Sherry A. Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, California and the author of “She-ology: The Definitive Guide to Women’s Intimate Health,” told HuffPost. “Sex can involve a lot of thrusting of the penis in and out of the vagina, typically pushing extra air into a dead-end space.”  Certain sex positions, like doggy style where your pelvis is titled upwards, or abruptly switching from one position to another, may increase the likelihood of queefing. Even non-sexual activities, like putting in a tampon or menstrual cup, practicing yoga (like when you move out of an inversion pose) or your gyno inserting a speculum can lead to queefing.  “From my experience as an OB-GYN, almost every woman has experienced at least one episode of queefing some time during her life, sometimes even during a pelvic exam,” said Diana Hoppe, an OB-GYN in Encinitas, California.  While the gas that comes out of your rectum may have a foul odor (a result of bacterial activity in the gut), queefs are odorless, Hoppe added.  Advertisement  Can you prevent a queef?  And as OB-GYN Sheila Loanzon told Cosmopolitan, “If you try to contract the vaginal canal to prevent air from coming in, it can cause sex to be more painful.”  Advertisement  “Also, when doing any abdominal exercises or weight-bearing exercise, it is important to squeeze the pelvic floor while holding the core abdominal muscles tight,” Hoppe said. “Many women squeeze abdominal muscles but do not activate the pelvic floor at the same time, thus allowing the pelvic floor to sag, increasing the likelihood of air entering into vaginal canal.”  During sex, keeping the penis, fingers or sex toy inside you while you change positions could lessen your chances of queefing because it “gives air less of an opportunity to get into the vagina,” Jamil Abdur-Rahman, an OB-GYN and the chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vista Health System in Waukegan, Illinois, told Self.  Advertisement  And in theory, you could just avoid certain sex or yoga positions altogether. But what’s the fun in that?  When queefing does happen, don’t sweat it.  So why does this very normal bodily function feel so embarrassing in the moment, be it during doggy-style or downward dog? It really just comes down to that pesky noise, Hoppe said.  “The stigma is due to lack of understanding the difference between release of air from the vagina and flatulence,” she said. “The sound effects may be the same though, so culturally there may be a stigma or embarrassment due to this occurring ‘down there.’”  Advertisement  Sex therapist Vanessa Marin underscored the fact that queefing is normal, common and “not anything to be ashamed of.” Embracing the awkwardness of the moment can even make sex more enjoyable for both partners.  “Our bodies make funny noises sometimes, and that’s OK!” she said. “Plus, there are plenty of other goofy things about sex, like getting sweaty, slipping out, getting into awkward positions and so on. The more we can laugh about these kinds of things, the more fun we’ll have during sex.”  When a queef slips out mid-coitus, you have two choices: ignore that deflating balloon sound completely or quickly acknowledge it and move on. Marin prefers the latter route.  Advertisement  “It’s a personal preference, but I think it’s better to just quickly acknowledge it and laugh it off,” she said. “That way you don’t have to sit there thinking about it, anxiously wondering whether or not your partner heard it.”  Is queefing ever cause for concern?  Generally, queefing is nothing to be worried about. While rare, if queefing is accompanied by pain or a bad smell, you should make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any more serious issues.  “If queefing is associated with a foul odor, it may be an indication of a vaginal infection or possible fistula, an [abnormal] connection between rectum and vagina due to previous radiation treatment or surgery that causes stool or feces to come out of the vagina,” Hoppe said.  Advertisement  But for the most part, queefing is a normal, if slightly awkward, fact of life. So let’s not get so hung up on it, OK?"

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

(AP) — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.

Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.

(Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.

The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

If you’re an avid traveler, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your passport fill up with stamps, turning that once-blank travel document into a nostalgic little memory book.  But as delightful as it is to have a paper trail of evidence of your past adventures, your large stamp collection could lead to issues on future trips if you don’t pay close attention. That’s all due to a passport validity rule that many people overlook.  Advertisement  “One rule many travelers miss is needing an adequate number of blank pages in their passport for visas, and entry and exit stamps,” David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com, told HuffPost. “This is often forgotten, especially by those with passports close to expiring or having only a few blank pages.”  The U.S. State Department did not set the blank pages rule, which stems from other countries’ requirements for international visitors.  “Some countries require passports to have at least two to four blank visa or stamp pages, and thus, some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met,” said Caroline Tanner, a trends writer at The Points Guy.  Advertisement  Just as travelers often need to have at least three to six months of passport validity beyond the dates of an international trip, they may also need to have a certain number of empty pages depending on the requirements at their destination.  “The basis for this rule is maintaining proper security measures and part of the entry and exit requirements,” Alwadish said. “Not meeting this requirement can cause problems at borders. If the traveler does not have the required blank pages in the passport, the passport will technically be invalid and the person may not be allowed to board the plane.”  He emphasized that airlines can bar passengers who do not meet the requirement from boarding their flights to avoid complications at the international destination.  Advertisement  “If for whatever reason it is overlooked in the U.S., the traveler may take a big risk once they arrive at their destination country, as every border patrol officer has the right to determine the outcome,” Alwadish explained. “They may have travelers detained, pay a fine or let them pass.”  Taking that kind of risk in a foreign country is not advisable, he added. And there’s a long list of countries that have this rule in place. Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Germany, India, Belgium, South Africa, the Netherlands, Cuba, Iceland, Zimbabwe and Indonesia are among the destinations that require two blank pages. Countries that require one page include France, Japan, Mexico, Greece, Thailand, Australia, Morocco, Argentina and Vietnam, among others. But you’ll need at least three blank pages if you want to visit Namibia, Botswana, Madagascar and Zambia.  “While some pages may be full of stamps, others might have one ― and just one stamp means that that page is not empty,” Alwadish cautioned.  Advertisement  Immigration authorities in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have also emphasized that the “endorsement” pages found at the back of many passports are different from visa pages and thus do not count as blank pages for the purposes of entry and exit stamps. (Newer passports have the endorsement section closer to the front.)  Meanwhile, Armenia and Micronesia have no stated blank passport page requirements.  “Countries like Sweden and the Philippines don’t require a blank page on your passport, but rather sufficient space for entry and exit stamps,” Alwadish noted.  He recommended looking at the State Department’s website for a breakdown of the specific entry prerequisites for each country.  Advertisement  Jake Wyman via Getty Images Many avid travelers delight in their extensive collections of passport stamps, but it's important to check the blank page requirements before visiting an international destination.  Keep in mind that blank page rules don’t just apply to U.S. visitors, either.  “This is true for all incoming travelers to the country, regardless of nationality, based on requirements set by individual countries for incoming visitors,” Tanner said.  Over time, frequent travelers may not need to worry as much about having enough empty passport pages.  Advertisement  “The issue of blank passport pages will likely become less of a significant problem for travelers as more countries are phasing out manual stamping of physical passport books,” Alwadish said. “The European Union is spearheading this shift with the introduction of the Entry/Exit System, intended to expedite the border control process and improve data accuracy.”  He explained that this new system uses biometric technology to scan travelers’ fingerprints and faces at border checkpoints.  “This data will then be stored and used to verify their arrival and exits, cross referenced with their passport information, removing the necessity for physical passport stamps,” he said.  Advertisement  But for now, immigration officers still need to ensure there are enough pages for stamps and visas. So travelers must remain vigilant.  “It is always best to make sure your passport is valid and has at least two blank pages,” Alwadish noted. “If a traveler does not have enough blank pages available, they cannot add more to their physical book.”  As of 2016, the U.S. government does not allow travelers to add extra pages to their existing passports. If they need more pages, they must renew their passports.  Advertisement  People who often travel internationally might want to consider choosing the option for a bigger passport with more visa pages. It’s no extra cost, and all you have to do is check the box that says “large book” when you fill out the form.  If you have an impending trip abroad, there are ways to get a new passport in a rush on your own or by paying a third party for expedited service. And of course, the best way to avoid adding extra stress and hassle is to keep track of your passport and ensure it’s compliant throughout the year."

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

(AP Photo/Zurab Tsertsvadze) via Associated Press  Who is the outgoing president?  Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia’s opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.  The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.  ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us. He is controlled by a puppet government, by Bidzina Ivanishvili, by Putin,” protester Sandro Samkharadze said. Another protester waved a sign saying “We are children of Europe.”"

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads. Try and win an argument with any woman in Canada,” he said. “We’re pretty tough and resilient people.”"

(South Korean Presidential Office/Yonhap via AP) via AP  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s parliament on Saturday impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his stunning and short-lived martial law decree, a move that ended days of political paralysis but set up an intense debate over Yoon’s fate, as jubilant crowds roared to celebrate another defiant moment in the country’s resilient democracy.  The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85. Yoon’s presidential powers and duties were subsequently suspended and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s No. 2 official, took over presidential powers later Saturday.  Advertisement  The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he’s thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon’s impeachment after ruling party lawmakers boycotted it last Saturday. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon’s impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon’s impeachment was an outcome driven by “the people’s ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.”  Advertisement  Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, “We have preserved the constitutional order!”  In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached.

Advertisement  Han, who became the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han’s office.  South Korea’s executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade and finance and was the ambassador to the U.S. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.  Advertisement  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred.  Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law.  The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon “committed rebellion that hurts peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.” It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.  Advertisement  Yoon remains defiant  In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon had rejected the rebellion charges, calling his order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it “a monster” and “anti-state forces” that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.  Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a “mad declaration of war” against his own people.  Observers say Yoon’s speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon’s approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.  Advertisement  Some of Yoon’s claims don’t align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.  Most notably, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that after martial law was announced, Yoon called him and asked for his troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he didn’t carry out Yoon’s orders.  Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.  Advertisement  In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers. Roh jumped to his death in 2009, after he had left office, amid a corruption scandal involving his family.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea.  He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations."

Advertisement  Jennifer Rodgers, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, on Friday described Friedman Agnifilo as the “sort of person you want” to take on the case.  “What you want is a lawyer who can take you through the real case,” Rodgers told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, adding that “Karen is the sort of person with all of her many years of experience as a trial lawyer and in this actual courthouse and in this actual office.”  Friedman Agnifilo — in a CNN appearance Tuesday, before she was retained — predicted that there could be a “not guilty by reason of insanity” defense in the case, as the evidence is “going to be so overwhelming that he [the suspect] did what he did.”  Advertisement  “As a former prosecutor in that [Manhattan District Attorney’s Office] ... I would be concerned that you have someone who is a valedictorian of his class. He was brilliant his whole life. He comes from this great family. I mean, something changed, right? Significantly, something changed,” she said.  “And they’re going to, I think, potentially have a ‘not guilty by reason of insanity’ potential defense. So the prosecutors are going to try to shore that up as well in their investigation.”  Advertisement  Thomas Dickey, Mangione’s lawyer in Pennsylvania, has said that his client plans to plead not guilty in that state. Dickey said this week that he hadn’t yet seen evidence that would implicate his client  “I don’t even know if this is him or whatever,” Dickey said on Tuesday."

Mark Warner (D-Va.) said Monday at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit.  Advertisement  Warner said he wanted to know about Gabbard’s “interchange with Assad and seeming affinity for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” as well as her support for intel whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.  The Assad linkage is so widely discussed that Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to Mike Pence during his vice presidency, made a cutting joke on a Sunday morning political talk show, saying that the three people most worried by Assad’s recent downfall were “Putin, the ayatollah [of Iran] and Tulsi Gabbard.”  Gabbard, who was a member of Congress from 2013 to 2021, traveled to Syria in 2017 to meet with Assad in a trip that raised eyebrows.  Advertisement  After inheriting leadership of his country from his father, Assad was known for being a particularly brutal and corrupt dictator, even by Middle East standards. In 2013, his forces were accused of using sarin gas in an attack killing 1,400 people and of using barrel bombs — explosives that can be made from empty barrels and other scrap, along with gasoline and shrapnel — against civilians. His government’s expertise in torture led the U.S. to outsource interrogations of some terrorism suspects there during President George W. Bush’s “global war on terror.”  In the wake of Assad’s fall, some of the costs of his rule have come to light, with journalists documenting his fancy car collection and the release of people kept in the brutal Saydnaya prison.  Freedom House, a democracy advocacy group, gave Syria a score of only 1 out of 100 in its 2024 ranking of countries by how free they are, ahead of only Tibet and Nagorno-Karabakh (which Freedom House includes as disputed territories).  Advertisement  After her 2017 trip, Gabbard defended herself, saying any peace deal amid Syria’s civil war would need Assad’s sign-off.  “Whatever you think about President Assad, the fact is that he is the president of Syria,” she said then.  That changed over the weekend, when Assad fled the country and received asylum in Russia under the protection of fellow strongman Putin. His fall ended more than 50 years of family rule after a stunning 11-day rebel advance.  Advertisement  During her time in the House of Representatives, Gabbard often justified a light touch with Assad by citing the threat of victory by Islamic militants, who were among the rival factions challenging his governance in the civil war. That stance also seemed to conveniently diminish Assad’s culpability for likely war crimes.  “Let the Syrian people themselves determine their future, not the United States, not some foreign country,” she told CNN in 2017.  While the group that led the rebel coalition to take down Assad, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government and has been affiliated with al Qaeda in the past, the opening days of post-Assad Syria have not seen the fundamentalist Islamic crackdown some had feared.  Advertisement  On Monday, Gabbard told reporters that her views now aligned with Trump’s, who’s commented on Assad’s fall by saying that the U.S. should not get involved — an option that virtually no one had suggested.  “I stand in full support and wholeheartedly agree with the statements that President Trump has made over these last few days with regards to the developments in Syria,” Gabbard stated.  Here are some of the things Gabbard had said on the floor of the House, or later inserted as written statements in the Congressional Record, on the need to keep Assad from being toppled and what would happen after his fall:  Advertisement  May 2018  In advocating for removing language in an annual defense policy bill that approved developing a strategy to counter Iran, Gabbard said, “It’s clear that, if left unchecked, war hawks in the Trump administration will drag our country into more Middle East wars, leaving destruction in its wake around the world and here at home.”  She added: “So what’s the objective of this authorization for war? Is it regime change in Iran? Regime change in Syria? More war against Iran and Syria? Yemen?”  December 2016  Talking about her bill to prohibit the government from supporting foreign terror groups, Gabbard said the U.S. had for years been “directly and indirectly supporting allies and partners of groups like al Qaeda and ISIS with money, weapons, intelligence and other support in their fight to overthrow the Syrian government.”  Advertisement  “The Wall Street Journal reports that rebel groups are, quote, ‘doubling down on their alliance’ with al Qaeda. This alliance has rendered the phrase ‘moderate rebels’ meaningless. We must stop this madness,” she said.  June 2016  Speaking of a provision to equip and train rebel Syrian groups in a defense funding bill, Gabbard said the groups remained focused on overthrowing Assad, which would end up “creating an even worse humanitarian crisis and an even greater threat to the world.”  “We’re waging two wars in Syria, providing arms and support to groups that have opposing objectives,” she said. “The first war is a counterproductive one to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad, which must end. And the second is our war to defeat ISIS, al Qaeda and other jihadist groups, which we must win. By helping groups fighting to overthrow Assad, we’re essentially helping ISIS and al Qaeda achieve their objective of taking over all of Syria.”  Advertisement  March 2016  In discussing one of two Syria-related resolutions, Gabbard called it “a thinly veiled attempt to use the rationale of humanitarianism as a justification for overthrowing the Syrian government of Assad.”  “If the U.S. is successful in its current effort to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad, allowing groups like ISIS and al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations to take over all of Syria, which is what will happen, including those Assad-controlled areas where Christians and other religious minorities remain protected, the United States will be morally culpable for the genocide that will occur as a result,” she said.  “This is exactly what happened when we overthrew Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It is what happened in Libya when we overthrew Muammar Gaddafi. To do the same thing over and over and expect a different result is the definition of insanity.”  Advertisement  March 2016  In discussing another resolution, Gabbard said she objected specifically to language saying that “Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s violence against the Syrian people has attracted foreign fighters from around the world, who have supported and committed ISIL [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant] atrocities.”  “I fully reject this amendment to the resolution which gives moral legitimacy to the actions of ISIS, al-Qaeda, and others who are committing genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities in Syria,” she said.  December 2014  In debating an annual defense policy bill, Gabbard said a provision to train what were described as “moderate” Syrian rebels “seriously polluted this critical piece of legislation.”  Advertisement  “I could not in good conscience vote to support the so-called moderate forces who often work hand in hand with al Qaeda or ISIS, and whose personnel and weapons often end up in the hands of those terrorists,” she said. “This bill continues the same failed practices of undeclared war, regime change and nation-building that have held us mired in the Middle East for over a decade.”  September 2014  In debating an amendment to a stopgap spending bill to aid Syrian opposition, Gabbard said, “Voting to support this proposal is actually a vote to overthrow Assad because overthrowing Assad is the primary objective of the so-called Free Syrian Army.”  She added: “If we combine the missions of destroying ISIL and of overthrowing Assad, this is not a smart or effective strategy for a number of reasons. We must focus on one mission — to destroy ISIL and other Islamic extremists who’ve declared war on us. Our mission should not be to topple the Assad regime, which would make the situation in the region even worse and more unstable than it is today.”"

Left: Amazon MGM Studios; Right: Roadside Attractions  Unless folks are doing something like recording whole scenes of a movie on their cellphones, you generally don’t notice who else is in the audience with you at a movie theater. The lights fade to black, the screen brightens and everything — and everyone — around you virtually disappears. But sometimes taking stock of how others react to a film can tell you a lot about who becomes the arbiters of merit and why.  That’s especially true when you’re watching a Black movie.  An example that comes to mind is “12 Years a Slave,” which tells the harrowing true story of a free Black man who was abducted and sold into slavery in 1841. At a 2013 press screening for the film in Manhattan, an inclusive audience sat transfixed in front of the screen during multiple scenes of sexual and physical violence.  Advertisement  Perusing the theater during those moments revealed something interesting. Some Black viewers were stone-faced, while others seemed exhausted by the second or third brutality scene. Many of the white folks, though, were inconsolable — sobbing and blowing their noses. Perhaps that was on account of white guilt, a performative impulse, or because the film really is that stirring.  In any case, “12 Years a Slave,” a Steve McQueen-directed movie that unflinchingly portrays the horrors of white supremacy, was heralded by a predominantly white and so-called liberal Hollywood elite. And it went on to earn nine Oscar nominations.  There was another staggering Black drama released that same year that was also a nonfiction story dealing with systemic racism, though in a more modern context: “Fruitvale Station.” It earned exactly zero nominations from that same voting branch.  Advertisement  While the Ryan Coogler-directed film can hardly be accused of not engaging with the issue of whiteness through the lens of police brutality, there is a crucial difference between it and the aforementioned offering. It does not hinge on the racially motivated atrocity against its lead character or its perpetrator. Rather, it centers the Black human life that was cut short. It examines who the person was outside of the system of whiteness.  Ethan Herisse (left) and Brandon Wilson in ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  In essence, it’s not a film that necessarily brings white audiences into its story. It actually seems indifferent to whatever reaction they might have. A Hollywood voting establishment that, in spite of all its lip service, has always had an issue appreciating art that does not revolve around their lives or even their ills could see that as a detriment.  Advertisement  They often look for art they can laud that can at least give the appearance that they’re progressive despite showing all signs of the opposite. It’s a self-gratifying tactic that doesn’t serve the art at all, no matter how good it is.  It’s been over a decade since “12 Years a Slave” and “Fruitvale Station” were released, and white people’s proximity to a Black narrative still weighs heavily on their acclaim for it. This year’s “Nickel Boys” and “Exhibiting Forgiveness” are two other Black films that have had parallel journeys to the big screen and awards season. But their trajectories could not be more different — and for the same reason as their predecessors.  Similar to “12 Years a Slave,” “Nickel Boys,” an adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, is an unrelenting drama following the lives of two young Black men trying to survive an abusive and racist reform school in the 1960s. The performances are good. The movie’s technical merit, including its marvelous cinematography, has already helped it earn the attention of several awards bodies.  Advertisement  Despite it not even being released in limited theaters until Friday, there’s hardly a day that goes by in the last few months — since its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival this summer — that there isn’t press or hype about it. That includes numerous press screenings and initiatives.  But with the effects of systemic oppression being an impeding factor of the story, leaving little space to explore the characters’ humanity, it’s hard not to again wonder whether its appeal to arbitrated audiences is also that it is more for them to appreciate than others who might identify with their experiences.  André Holland (left) and Andra Day in ""Exhibiting Forgiveness."" Courtesy of Roadside Attractions  Advertisement  Director RaMell Ross said he didn’t intend for that to be the case, though. When the filmmaker was asked in an interview with Vanity Fair what his expectations are of audiences that are “older, very white and wealthier,” he replied that “Nickel Boys” “emerges from our centrality, and it ostensibly is for us, but I’m happy to give it to others.”  “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” on the other hand, doesn’t provoke that same question. It almost entirely wrestles with the complexities of its Black characters, and in ways Black audiences especially recognize. Systemic prejudices are understood as the reality in which they live, only because they are Black and it’s set in the present day, not because the plot informs that. There’s nary a moment when the film even gestures toward that to tell its story.  That helps create an intensely insulated film that centers a Black family whose drama is also deeply felt and astoundingly performed. The conflicts, joy and contradictions that propel the plot are of their own making — and not the result of a racially motivated antagonist. White people, come to think of it, are merely ornamental in the story.  Advertisement  It is unequivocally a film by and for Black people to grapple with among ourselves — one that has similarly affected Black audiences in the way “12 Years a Slave” moved white viewers. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” allows white audiences to enter its narrative incidentally only, while films like “Nickel Boys” and “12 Years a Slave” often engage directly with their white audiences through their own historical (and present-day) examination.  It’s a distinction that often results in the latter films being considered worthy of Hollywood’s highest honors.  Taking a look at the theatrical and post-theatrical odysseys of “Exhibiting Forgiveness” and “Nickel Boys” might help bring this into further focus. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is an original story that was amazingly green-lit in our sequel- and adaptation-obsessed culture and based on the personal experiences of writer-director Titus Kaphar, a first-time feature filmmaker.  Advertisement  “Nickel Boys” came with all the fanfare of a known author, an acclaimed literary honor under its belt and at least the assumption that its Jim Crow-era setting means that whiteness could obviously play a significant role in the story. Even Ross’ avant-garde filmmaking that shifts the camera and perspective between the two lead characters couldn’t deter an audience that was already locked in.  Herisse stars as Elwood in a moment from ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  Ross also told Vanity Fair that the process between the film being green-lit and going into production through Orion Pictures and Amazon MGM Studios was fairly smooth, to his own surprise. And since its Telluride premiere just a few months ago, “Nickel Boys” has experienced a constant whirlwind of praise from various awards bodies and audiences.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, Kaphar told me during an interview that “it was a fight” to get “Exhibiting Forgiveness” released in theaters. Like many filmmakers, especially Black filmmakers whose work is too often considered niche, Kaphar was approached about bringing the film to a streaming service.  Despite earning rave reviews following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it went months without being acquired, and then months later — not until October — it was released by Roadside Attractions. By then, many people had forgotten about it or just hadn’t heard much about it at all.  Save from a video-on-demand release and awards screeners available to voting press, the film hasn’t been able to achieve any major award nominations and hasn’t popped up on most “best of 2024” lists. (It made HuffPost’s roundup.) Unlike “Fruitvale Station,” it also failed to earn an Independent Spirit Award nomination or other award precursor nominations.  Advertisement  None of this discussion is to elevate any one Black film above another, suggest that a certain kind of Black film is better than the next, or even pit two films against each other. Both can and should be in the conversation. It is to question the deciding bodies that dictate the merit of Black films and have an honest conversation about what actually motivates their choices."

(Don't Be Embarrassed, It's Normal.)","Cavan Images via Getty Images Flatulence from your vagina during sex or physical activities like yoga is common and nothing to be ashamed of.  Queefing, as anyone with a vagina will tell you, can happen at some inopportune times: while you’re having sex, in the middle of a yoga class or during a visit to the gynecologist.  You may have heard some people refer to queefs as “vaginal farts” (charming). But while queefs do produce a toot-like sound, we can assure you that queefing is not the same as passing gas.  Advertisement  We talked to gynecologists and sex therapists to learn more about what causes queefs, some of the misconceptions about them and why they shouldn’t be as mortifying as we make them out to be.  What makes you queef, anyway?  Queefing is an involuntary bodily function that occurs when air is pushed into the vagina, gets temporarily trapped in the folds of the vaginal canal (called rugae) and is then released.  Advertisement  “Queefing happens when a penis, fingers or sex toy go in and out of the vagina bringing additional air along with it,” Sherry A. Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, California and the author of “She-ology: The Definitive Guide to Women’s Intimate Health,” told HuffPost. “Sex can involve a lot of thrusting of the penis in and out of the vagina, typically pushing extra air into a dead-end space.”  Certain sex positions, like doggy style where your pelvis is titled upwards, or abruptly switching from one position to another, may increase the likelihood of queefing. Even non-sexual activities, like putting in a tampon or menstrual cup, practicing yoga (like when you move out of an inversion pose) or your gyno inserting a speculum can lead to queefing.  “From my experience as an OB-GYN, almost every woman has experienced at least one episode of queefing some time during her life, sometimes even during a pelvic exam,” said Diana Hoppe, an OB-GYN in Encinitas, California.  While the gas that comes out of your rectum may have a foul odor (a result of bacterial activity in the gut), queefs are odorless, Hoppe added.  Advertisement  Can you prevent a queef?  And as OB-GYN Sheila Loanzon told Cosmopolitan, “If you try to contract the vaginal canal to prevent air from coming in, it can cause sex to be more painful.”  Advertisement  “Also, when doing any abdominal exercises or weight-bearing exercise, it is important to squeeze the pelvic floor while holding the core abdominal muscles tight,” Hoppe said. “Many women squeeze abdominal muscles but do not activate the pelvic floor at the same time, thus allowing the pelvic floor to sag, increasing the likelihood of air entering into vaginal canal.”  During sex, keeping the penis, fingers or sex toy inside you while you change positions could lessen your chances of queefing because it “gives air less of an opportunity to get into the vagina,” Jamil Abdur-Rahman, an OB-GYN and the chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vista Health System in Waukegan, Illinois, told Self.  Advertisement  And in theory, you could just avoid certain sex or yoga positions altogether. But what’s the fun in that?  When queefing does happen, don’t sweat it.  So why does this very normal bodily function feel so embarrassing in the moment, be it during doggy-style or downward dog? It really just comes down to that pesky noise, Hoppe said.  “The stigma is due to lack of understanding the difference between release of air from the vagina and flatulence,” she said. “The sound effects may be the same though, so culturally there may be a stigma or embarrassment due to this occurring ‘down there.’”  Advertisement  Sex therapist Vanessa Marin underscored the fact that queefing is normal, common and “not anything to be ashamed of.” Embracing the awkwardness of the moment can even make sex more enjoyable for both partners.  “Our bodies make funny noises sometimes, and that’s OK!” she said. “Plus, there are plenty of other goofy things about sex, like getting sweaty, slipping out, getting into awkward positions and so on. The more we can laugh about these kinds of things, the more fun we’ll have during sex.”  When a queef slips out mid-coitus, you have two choices: ignore that deflating balloon sound completely or quickly acknowledge it and move on. Marin prefers the latter route.  Advertisement  “It’s a personal preference, but I think it’s better to just quickly acknowledge it and laugh it off,” she said. “That way you don’t have to sit there thinking about it, anxiously wondering whether or not your partner heard it.”  Is queefing ever cause for concern?  Generally, queefing is nothing to be worried about. While rare, if queefing is accompanied by pain or a bad smell, you should make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any more serious issues.  “If queefing is associated with a foul odor, it may be an indication of a vaginal infection or possible fistula, an [abnormal] connection between rectum and vagina due to previous radiation treatment or surgery that causes stool or feces to come out of the vagina,” Hoppe said.  Advertisement  But for the most part, queefing is a normal, if slightly awkward, fact of life. So let’s not get so hung up on it, OK?"

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.

MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

(AP) — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.  Advertisement  This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what’s behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  More drone sightings have been reported in New York City, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.

This photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. (Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

If you’re an avid traveler, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your passport fill up with stamps, turning that once-blank travel document into a nostalgic little memory book.  But as delightful as it is to have a paper trail of evidence of your past adventures, your large stamp collection could lead to issues on future trips if you don’t pay close attention. That’s all due to a passport validity rule that many people overlook.  Advertisement  “One rule many travelers miss is needing an adequate number of blank pages in their passport for visas, and entry and exit stamps,” David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com, told HuffPost. “This is often forgotten, especially by those with passports close to expiring or having only a few blank pages.”  The U.S. State Department did not set the blank pages rule, which stems from other countries’ requirements for international visitors.  “Some countries require passports to have at least two to four blank visa or stamp pages, and thus, some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met,” said Caroline Tanner, a trends writer at The Points Guy.  Advertisement  Just as travelers often need to have at least three to six months of passport validity beyond the dates of an international trip, they may also need to have a certain number of empty pages depending on the requirements at their destination.  “The basis for this rule is maintaining proper security measures and part of the entry and exit requirements,” Alwadish said. “Not meeting this requirement can cause problems at borders. If the traveler does not have the required blank pages in the passport, the passport will technically be invalid and the person may not be allowed to board the plane.”  He emphasized that airlines can bar passengers who do not meet the requirement from boarding their flights to avoid complications at the international destination.  Advertisement  “If for whatever reason it is overlooked in the U.S., the traveler may take a big risk once they arrive at their destination country, as every border patrol officer has the right to determine the outcome,” Alwadish explained. “They may have travelers detained, pay a fine or let them pass.”  Taking that kind of risk in a foreign country is not advisable, he added. And there’s a long list of countries that have this rule in place. Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Germany, India, Belgium, South Africa, the Netherlands, Cuba, Iceland, Zimbabwe and Indonesia are among the destinations that require two blank pages. Countries that require one page include France, Japan, Mexico, Greece, Thailand, Australia, Morocco, Argentina and Vietnam, among others. But you’ll need at least three blank pages if you want to visit Namibia, Botswana, Madagascar and Zambia.  “While some pages may be full of stamps, others might have one ― and just one stamp means that that page is not empty,” Alwadish cautioned.  Advertisement  Immigration authorities in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have also emphasized that the “endorsement” pages found at the back of many passports are different from visa pages and thus do not count as blank pages for the purposes of entry and exit stamps. (Newer passports have the endorsement section closer to the front.)  Meanwhile, Armenia and Micronesia have no stated blank passport page requirements.  “Countries like Sweden and the Philippines don’t require a blank page on your passport, but rather sufficient space for entry and exit stamps,” Alwadish noted.  He recommended looking at the State Department’s website for a breakdown of the specific entry prerequisites for each country.  Advertisement  Jake Wyman via Getty Images Many avid travelers delight in their extensive collections of passport stamps, but it's important to check the blank page requirements before visiting an international destination.  Keep in mind that blank page rules don’t just apply to U.S. visitors, either.  “This is true for all incoming travelers to the country, regardless of nationality, based on requirements set by individual countries for incoming visitors,” Tanner said.  Over time, frequent travelers may not need to worry as much about having enough empty passport pages.  Advertisement  “The issue of blank passport pages will likely become less of a significant problem for travelers as more countries are phasing out manual stamping of physical passport books,” Alwadish said. “The European Union is spearheading this shift with the introduction of the Entry/Exit System, intended to expedite the border control process and improve data accuracy.”  He explained that this new system uses biometric technology to scan travelers’ fingerprints and faces at border checkpoints.  “This data will then be stored and used to verify their arrival and exits, cross referenced with their passport information, removing the necessity for physical passport stamps,” he said.  Advertisement  But for now, immigration officers still need to ensure there are enough pages for stamps and visas. So travelers must remain vigilant.  “It is always best to make sure your passport is valid and has at least two blank pages,” Alwadish noted. “If a traveler does not have enough blank pages available, they cannot add more to their physical book.”  As of 2016, the U.S. government does not allow travelers to add extra pages to their existing passports. If they need more pages, they must renew their passports.  Advertisement  People who often travel internationally might want to consider choosing the option for a bigger passport with more visa pages. It’s no extra cost, and all you have to do is check the box that says “large book” when you fill out the form.  If you have an impending trip abroad, there are ways to get a new passport in a rush on your own or by paying a third party for expedited service. And of course, the best way to avoid adding extra stress and hassle is to keep track of your passport and ensure it’s compliant throughout the year."

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia’s opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.  The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.  ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us. He is controlled by a puppet government, by Bidzina Ivanishvili, by Putin,” protester Sandro Samkharadze said. Another protester waved a sign saying “We are children of Europe.”"

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads. Try and win an argument with any woman in Canada,” he said. “We’re pretty tough and resilient people.”"

(South Korean Presidential Office/Yonhap via AP) via AP  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s parliament on Saturday impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his stunning and short-lived martial law decree, a move that ended days of political paralysis but set up an intense debate over Yoon’s fate, as jubilant crowds roared to celebrate another defiant moment in the country’s resilient democracy.  The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85. Yoon’s presidential powers and duties were subsequently suspended and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s No. 2 official, took over presidential powers later Saturday.  Advertisement  The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he’s thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon’s impeachment after ruling party lawmakers boycotted it last Saturday. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon’s impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon’s impeachment was an outcome driven by “the people’s ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.”  Advertisement  Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, “We have preserved the constitutional order!”  In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached. Both rallies have largely been peaceful.

(AP Photo/Ahnn Young-joon) Ahn Young-joon via AP  The new leader bolsters the country’s security posture  Yoon issued a statement saying he would “never give up” and calling for officials to maintain stability in government functions during what he described as a “temporary” pause of his presidency.  “I will carry with me all the criticisms, encouragement and support directed toward me, and I will continue to do my utmost for the country until the very last moment,” Yoon said.  Advertisement  Han, who became the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han’s office.  South Korea’s executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade and finance and was the ambassador to the U.S. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.  Advertisement  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred.  Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law.  The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon “committed rebellion that hurts peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.” It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.  Advertisement  Yoon remains defiant  In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon had rejected the rebellion charges, calling his order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it “a monster” and “anti-state forces” that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.  Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a “mad declaration of war” against his own people.  Observers say Yoon’s speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon’s approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.  Advertisement  Some of Yoon’s claims don’t align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.  Most notably, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that after martial law was announced, Yoon called him and asked for his troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he didn’t carry out Yoon’s orders.  Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.  Advertisement  In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers. Roh jumped to his death in 2009, after he had left office, amid a corruption scandal involving his family.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea.  He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations."

Mangione has hired Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who for years worked in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office under Cyrus Vance Jr. before going into the private sector, to represent him in New York, as CNN first reported Friday and other outlets have since corroborated.  Advertisement  The shooting suspect remains in custody in Pennsylvania after his arrest there on charges such as forgery and illegal possession of a firearm. He is fighting extradition to New York, where he has been charged with second-degree murder.  HuffPost has reached out to Friedman Agnifilo for comment.  The news comes as officials say they have found new evidence in the case, with New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch stating that a 3D-printed gun Mangione possessed at the time of his Pennsylvania arrest matched three shell casings recovered at the Manhattan shooting scene.  His fingerprints also matched those that investigators found on a water bottle and granola bar wrapper located near the scene, police said.  Advertisement  Jennifer Rodgers, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, on Friday described Friedman Agnifilo as the “sort of person you want” to take on the case.  “What you want is a lawyer who can take you through the real case,” Rodgers told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, adding that “Karen is the sort of person with all of her many years of experience as a trial lawyer and in this actual courthouse and in this actual office.”  Friedman Agnifilo — in a CNN appearance Tuesday, before she was retained — predicted that there could be a “not guilty by reason of insanity” defense in the case, as the evidence is “going to be so overwhelming that he [the suspect] did what he did.”  Advertisement  “As a former prosecutor in that [Manhattan District Attorney’s Office] ... I would be concerned that you have someone who is a valedictorian of his class. He was brilliant his whole life. He comes from this great family. I mean, something changed, right? Significantly, something changed,” she said.  “And they’re going to, I think, potentially have a ‘not guilty by reason of insanity’ potential defense. So the prosecutors are going to try to shore that up as well in their investigation.”  Advertisement  Thomas Dickey, Mangione’s lawyer in Pennsylvania, has said that his client plans to plead not guilty in that state. Dickey said this week that he hadn’t yet seen evidence that would implicate his client  “I don’t even know if this is him or whatever,” Dickey said on Tuesday."

Mark Warner (D-Va.) said Monday at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit.  Advertisement  Warner said he wanted to know about Gabbard’s “interchange with Assad and seeming affinity for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” as well as her support for intel whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.  The Assad linkage is so widely discussed that Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to Mike Pence during his vice presidency, made a cutting joke on a Sunday morning political talk show, saying that the three people most worried by Assad’s recent downfall were “Putin, the ayatollah [of Iran] and Tulsi Gabbard.”  Gabbard, who was a member of Congress from 2013 to 2021, traveled to Syria in 2017 to meet with Assad in a trip that raised eyebrows.  Advertisement  After inheriting leadership of his country from his father, Assad was known for being a particularly brutal and corrupt dictator, even by Middle East standards. In 2013, his forces were accused of using sarin gas in an attack killing 1,400 people and of using barrel bombs — explosives that can be made from empty barrels and other scrap, along with gasoline and shrapnel — against civilians. His government’s expertise in torture led the U.S. to outsource interrogations of some terrorism suspects there during President George W. Bush’s “global war on terror.”  In the wake of Assad’s fall, some of the costs of his rule have come to light, with journalists documenting his fancy car collection and the release of people kept in the brutal Saydnaya prison.  Freedom House, a democracy advocacy group, gave Syria a score of only 1 out of 100 in its 2024 ranking of countries by how free they are, ahead of only Tibet and Nagorno-Karabakh (which Freedom House includes as disputed territories).  Advertisement  After her 2017 trip, Gabbard defended herself, saying any peace deal amid Syria’s civil war would need Assad’s sign-off.  “Whatever you think about President Assad, the fact is that he is the president of Syria,” she said then.  That changed over the weekend, when Assad fled the country and received asylum in Russia under the protection of fellow strongman Putin. His fall ended more than 50 years of family rule after a stunning 11-day rebel advance.  Advertisement  During her time in the House of Representatives, Gabbard often justified a light touch with Assad by citing the threat of victory by Islamic militants, who were among the rival factions challenging his governance in the civil war. That stance also seemed to conveniently diminish Assad’s culpability for likely war crimes.  “Let the Syrian people themselves determine their future, not the United States, not some foreign country,” she told CNN in 2017.  While the group that led the rebel coalition to take down Assad, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government and has been affiliated with al Qaeda in the past, the opening days of post-Assad Syria have not seen the fundamentalist Islamic crackdown some had feared.  Advertisement  On Monday, Gabbard told reporters that her views now aligned with Trump’s, who’s commented on Assad’s fall by saying that the U.S. should not get involved — an option that virtually no one had suggested.  “I stand in full support and wholeheartedly agree with the statements that President Trump has made over these last few days with regards to the developments in Syria,” Gabbard stated.  Here are some of the things Gabbard had said on the floor of the House, or later inserted as written statements in the Congressional Record, on the need to keep Assad from being toppled and what would happen after his fall:  Advertisement  May 2018  In advocating for removing language in an annual defense policy bill that approved developing a strategy to counter Iran, Gabbard said, “It’s clear that, if left unchecked, war hawks in the Trump administration will drag our country into more Middle East wars, leaving destruction in its wake around the world and here at home.”  She added: “So what’s the objective of this authorization for war? Is it regime change in Iran? Regime change in Syria? More war against Iran and Syria? Yemen?”  December 2016  Talking about her bill to prohibit the government from supporting foreign terror groups, Gabbard said the U.S. had for years been “directly and indirectly supporting allies and partners of groups like al Qaeda and ISIS with money, weapons, intelligence and other support in their fight to overthrow the Syrian government.”  Advertisement  “The Wall Street Journal reports that rebel groups are, quote, ‘doubling down on their alliance’ with al Qaeda. This alliance has rendered the phrase ‘moderate rebels’ meaningless. We must stop this madness,” she said.  June 2016  Speaking of a provision to equip and train rebel Syrian groups in a defense funding bill, Gabbard said the groups remained focused on overthrowing Assad, which would end up “creating an even worse humanitarian crisis and an even greater threat to the world.”  “We’re waging two wars in Syria, providing arms and support to groups that have opposing objectives,” she said. “The first war is a counterproductive one to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad, which must end. And the second is our war to defeat ISIS, al Qaeda and other jihadist groups, which we must win. By helping groups fighting to overthrow Assad, we’re essentially helping ISIS and al Qaeda achieve their objective of taking over all of Syria.”  Advertisement  March 2016  In discussing one of two Syria-related resolutions, Gabbard called it “a thinly veiled attempt to use the rationale of humanitarianism as a justification for overthrowing the Syrian government of Assad.”  “If the U.S. is successful in its current effort to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad, allowing groups like ISIS and al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations to take over all of Syria, which is what will happen, including those Assad-controlled areas where Christians and other religious minorities remain protected, the United States will be morally culpable for the genocide that will occur as a result,” she said.  “This is exactly what happened when we overthrew Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It is what happened in Libya when we overthrew Muammar Gaddafi. To do the same thing over and over and expect a different result is the definition of insanity.”  Advertisement  March 2016  In discussing another resolution, Gabbard said she objected specifically to language saying that “Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s violence against the Syrian people has attracted foreign fighters from around the world, who have supported and committed ISIL [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant] atrocities.”  “I fully reject this amendment to the resolution which gives moral legitimacy to the actions of ISIS, al-Qaeda, and others who are committing genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities in Syria,” she said.  December 2014  In debating an annual defense policy bill, Gabbard said a provision to train what were described as “moderate” Syrian rebels “seriously polluted this critical piece of legislation.”  Advertisement  “I could not in good conscience vote to support the so-called moderate forces who often work hand in hand with al Qaeda or ISIS, and whose personnel and weapons often end up in the hands of those terrorists,” she said. “This bill continues the same failed practices of undeclared war, regime change and nation-building that have held us mired in the Middle East for over a decade.”  September 2014  In debating an amendment to a stopgap spending bill to aid Syrian opposition, Gabbard said, “Voting to support this proposal is actually a vote to overthrow Assad because overthrowing Assad is the primary objective of the so-called Free Syrian Army.”  She added: “If we combine the missions of destroying ISIL and of overthrowing Assad, this is not a smart or effective strategy for a number of reasons. We must focus on one mission — to destroy ISIL and other Islamic extremists who’ve declared war on us. Our mission should not be to topple the Assad regime, which would make the situation in the region even worse and more unstable than it is today.”"

Left: Amazon MGM Studios; Right: Roadside Attractions  Unless folks are doing something like recording whole scenes of a movie on their cellphones, you generally don’t notice who else is in the audience with you at a movie theater. The lights fade to black, the screen brightens and everything — and everyone — around you virtually disappears. But sometimes taking stock of how others react to a film can tell you a lot about who becomes the arbiters of merit and why.  That’s especially true when you’re watching a Black movie.  An example that comes to mind is “12 Years a Slave,” which tells the harrowing true story of a free Black man who was abducted and sold into slavery in 1841. At a 2013 press screening for the film in Manhattan, an inclusive audience sat transfixed in front of the screen during multiple scenes of sexual and physical violence.  Advertisement  Perusing the theater during those moments revealed something interesting. Some Black viewers were stone-faced, while others seemed exhausted by the second or third brutality scene. Many of the white folks, though, were inconsolable — sobbing and blowing their noses. Perhaps that was on account of white guilt, a performative impulse, or because the film really is that stirring.  In any case, “12 Years a Slave,” a Steve McQueen-directed movie that unflinchingly portrays the horrors of white supremacy, was heralded by a predominantly white and so-called liberal Hollywood elite. And it went on to earn nine Oscar nominations.  There was another staggering Black drama released that same year that was also a nonfiction story dealing with systemic racism, though in a more modern context: “Fruitvale Station.” It earned exactly zero nominations from that same voting branch.  Advertisement  While the Ryan Coogler-directed film can hardly be accused of not engaging with the issue of whiteness through the lens of police brutality, there is a crucial difference between it and the aforementioned offering. It does not hinge on the racially motivated atrocity against its lead character or its perpetrator. Rather, it centers the Black human life that was cut short. It examines who the person was outside of the system of whiteness.  Ethan Herisse (left) and Brandon Wilson in ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  In essence, it’s not a film that necessarily brings white audiences into its story. It actually seems indifferent to whatever reaction they might have. A Hollywood voting establishment that, in spite of all its lip service, has always had an issue appreciating art that does not revolve around their lives or even their ills could see that as a detriment.  Advertisement  They often look for art they can laud that can at least give the appearance that they’re progressive despite showing all signs of the opposite. It’s a self-gratifying tactic that doesn’t serve the art at all, no matter how good it is.  It’s been over a decade since “12 Years a Slave” and “Fruitvale Station” were released, and white people’s proximity to a Black narrative still weighs heavily on their acclaim for it. This year’s “Nickel Boys” and “Exhibiting Forgiveness” are two other Black films that have had parallel journeys to the big screen and awards season. But their trajectories could not be more different — and for the same reason as their predecessors.  Similar to “12 Years a Slave,” “Nickel Boys,” an adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, is an unrelenting drama following the lives of two young Black men trying to survive an abusive and racist reform school in the 1960s. The performances are good. The movie’s technical merit, including its marvelous cinematography, has already helped it earn the attention of several awards bodies.  Advertisement  Despite it not even being released in limited theaters until Friday, there’s hardly a day that goes by in the last few months — since its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival this summer — that there isn’t press or hype about it. That includes numerous press screenings and initiatives.  But with the effects of systemic oppression being an impeding factor of the story, leaving little space to explore the characters’ humanity, it’s hard not to again wonder whether its appeal to arbitrated audiences is also that it is more for them to appreciate than others who might identify with their experiences.  André Holland (left) and Andra Day in ""Exhibiting Forgiveness."" Courtesy of Roadside Attractions  Advertisement  Director RaMell Ross said he didn’t intend for that to be the case, though. When the filmmaker was asked in an interview with Vanity Fair what his expectations are of audiences that are “older, very white and wealthier,” he replied that “Nickel Boys” “emerges from our centrality, and it ostensibly is for us, but I’m happy to give it to others.”  “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” on the other hand, doesn’t provoke that same question. It almost entirely wrestles with the complexities of its Black characters, and in ways Black audiences especially recognize. Systemic prejudices are understood as the reality in which they live, only because they are Black and it’s set in the present day, not because the plot informs that. There’s nary a moment when the film even gestures toward that to tell its story.  That helps create an intensely insulated film that centers a Black family whose drama is also deeply felt and astoundingly performed. The conflicts, joy and contradictions that propel the plot are of their own making — and not the result of a racially motivated antagonist. White people, come to think of it, are merely ornamental in the story.  Advertisement  It is unequivocally a film by and for Black people to grapple with among ourselves — one that has similarly affected Black audiences in the way “12 Years a Slave” moved white viewers. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” allows white audiences to enter its narrative incidentally only, while films like “Nickel Boys” and “12 Years a Slave” often engage directly with their white audiences through their own historical (and present-day) examination.  It’s a distinction that often results in the latter films being considered worthy of Hollywood’s highest honors.  Taking a look at the theatrical and post-theatrical odysseys of “Exhibiting Forgiveness” and “Nickel Boys” might help bring this into further focus. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is an original story that was amazingly green-lit in our sequel- and adaptation-obsessed culture and based on the personal experiences of writer-director Titus Kaphar, a first-time feature filmmaker.  Advertisement  “Nickel Boys” came with all the fanfare of a known author, an acclaimed literary honor under its belt and at least the assumption that its Jim Crow-era setting means that whiteness could obviously play a significant role in the story. Even Ross’ avant-garde filmmaking that shifts the camera and perspective between the two lead characters couldn’t deter an audience that was already locked in.  Herisse stars as Elwood in a moment from ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  Ross also told Vanity Fair that the process between the film being green-lit and going into production through Orion Pictures and Amazon MGM Studios was fairly smooth, to his own surprise. And since its Telluride premiere just a few months ago, “Nickel Boys” has experienced a constant whirlwind of praise from various awards bodies and audiences.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, Kaphar told me during an interview that “it was a fight” to get “Exhibiting Forgiveness” released in theaters. Like many filmmakers, especially Black filmmakers whose work is too often considered niche, Kaphar was approached about bringing the film to a streaming service.  Despite earning rave reviews following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it went months without being acquired, and then months later — not until October — it was released by Roadside Attractions. By then, many people had forgotten about it or just hadn’t heard much about it at all.  Save from a video-on-demand release and awards screeners available to voting press, the film hasn’t been able to achieve any major award nominations and hasn’t popped up on most “best of 2024” lists. (It made HuffPost’s roundup.) Unlike “Fruitvale Station,” it also failed to earn an Independent Spirit Award nomination or other award precursor nominations.  Advertisement  None of this discussion is to elevate any one Black film above another, suggest that a certain kind of Black film is better than the next, or even pit two films against each other. Both can and should be in the conversation. It is to question the deciding bodies that dictate the merit of Black films and have an honest conversation about what actually motivates their choices."

(Don't Be Embarrassed, It's Normal.)","Cavan Images via Getty Images Flatulence from your vagina during sex or physical activities like yoga is common and nothing to be ashamed of.  Queefing, as anyone with a vagina will tell you, can happen at some inopportune times: while you’re having sex, in the middle of a yoga class or during a visit to the gynecologist.  You may have heard some people refer to queefs as “vaginal farts” (charming). But while queefs do produce a toot-like sound, we can assure you that queefing is not the same as passing gas.  Advertisement  We talked to gynecologists and sex therapists to learn more about what causes queefs, some of the misconceptions about them and why they shouldn’t be as mortifying as we make them out to be.  What makes you queef, anyway?  Queefing is an involuntary bodily function that occurs when air is pushed into the vagina, gets temporarily trapped in the folds of the vaginal canal (called rugae) and is then released.  Advertisement  “Queefing happens when a penis, fingers or sex toy go in and out of the vagina bringing additional air along with it,” Sherry A. Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, California and the author of “She-ology: The Definitive Guide to Women’s Intimate Health,” told HuffPost. “Sex can involve a lot of thrusting of the penis in and out of the vagina, typically pushing extra air into a dead-end space.”  Certain sex positions, like doggy style where your pelvis is titled upwards, or abruptly switching from one position to another, may increase the likelihood of queefing. Even non-sexual activities, like putting in a tampon or menstrual cup, practicing yoga (like when you move out of an inversion pose) or your gyno inserting a speculum can lead to queefing.  “From my experience as an OB-GYN, almost every woman has experienced at least one episode of queefing some time during her life, sometimes even during a pelvic exam,” said Diana Hoppe, an OB-GYN in Encinitas, California.  While the gas that comes out of your rectum may have a foul odor (a result of bacterial activity in the gut), queefs are odorless, Hoppe added.  Advertisement  Can you prevent a queef?  And as OB-GYN Sheila Loanzon told Cosmopolitan, “If you try to contract the vaginal canal to prevent air from coming in, it can cause sex to be more painful.”  Advertisement  “Also, when doing any abdominal exercises or weight-bearing exercise, it is important to squeeze the pelvic floor while holding the core abdominal muscles tight,” Hoppe said. “Many women squeeze abdominal muscles but do not activate the pelvic floor at the same time, thus allowing the pelvic floor to sag, increasing the likelihood of air entering into vaginal canal.”  During sex, keeping the penis, fingers or sex toy inside you while you change positions could lessen your chances of queefing because it “gives air less of an opportunity to get into the vagina,” Jamil Abdur-Rahman, an OB-GYN and the chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vista Health System in Waukegan, Illinois, told Self.  Advertisement  And in theory, you could just avoid certain sex or yoga positions altogether. But what’s the fun in that?  When queefing does happen, don’t sweat it.  So why does this very normal bodily function feel so embarrassing in the moment, be it during doggy-style or downward dog? It really just comes down to that pesky noise, Hoppe said.  “The stigma is due to lack of understanding the difference between release of air from the vagina and flatulence,” she said. “The sound effects may be the same though, so culturally there may be a stigma or embarrassment due to this occurring ‘down there.’”  Advertisement  Sex therapist Vanessa Marin underscored the fact that queefing is normal, common and “not anything to be ashamed of.” Embracing the awkwardness of the moment can even make sex more enjoyable for both partners.  “Our bodies make funny noises sometimes, and that’s OK!” she said. “Plus, there are plenty of other goofy things about sex, like getting sweaty, slipping out, getting into awkward positions and so on. The more we can laugh about these kinds of things, the more fun we’ll have during sex.”  When a queef slips out mid-coitus, you have two choices: ignore that deflating balloon sound completely or quickly acknowledge it and move on. Marin prefers the latter route.  Advertisement  “It’s a personal preference, but I think it’s better to just quickly acknowledge it and laugh it off,” she said. “That way you don’t have to sit there thinking about it, anxiously wondering whether or not your partner heard it.”  Is queefing ever cause for concern?  Generally, queefing is nothing to be worried about. While rare, if queefing is accompanied by pain or a bad smell, you should make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any more serious issues.  “If queefing is associated with a foul odor, it may be an indication of a vaginal infection or possible fistula, an [abnormal] connection between rectum and vagina due to previous radiation treatment or surgery that causes stool or feces to come out of the vagina,” Hoppe said.  Advertisement  But for the most part, queefing is a normal, if slightly awkward, fact of life. So let’s not get so hung up on it, OK?"

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.  Advertisement  “Whether or not it’s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I’m saying is it’s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,” he added.  ___"

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

If you’re an avid traveler, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your passport fill up with stamps, turning that once-blank travel document into a nostalgic little memory book.  But as delightful as it is to have a paper trail of evidence of your past adventures, your large stamp collection could lead to issues on future trips if you don’t pay close attention. That’s all due to a passport validity rule that many people overlook.  Advertisement  “One rule many travelers miss is needing an adequate number of blank pages in their passport for visas, and entry and exit stamps,” David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com, told HuffPost. “This is often forgotten, especially by those with passports close to expiring or having only a few blank pages.”  The U.S. State Department did not set the blank pages rule, which stems from other countries’ requirements for international visitors.  “Some countries require passports to have at least two to four blank visa or stamp pages, and thus, some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met,” said Caroline Tanner, a trends writer at The Points Guy.  Advertisement  Just as travelers often need to have at least three to six months of passport validity beyond the dates of an international trip, they may also need to have a certain number of empty pages depending on the requirements at their destination.  “The basis for this rule is maintaining proper security measures and part of the entry and exit requirements,” Alwadish said. “Not meeting this requirement can cause problems at borders. If the traveler does not have the required blank pages in the passport, the passport will technically be invalid and the person may not be allowed to board the plane.”  He emphasized that airlines can bar passengers who do not meet the requirement from boarding their flights to avoid complications at the international destination.  Advertisement  “If for whatever reason it is overlooked in the U.S., the traveler may take a big risk once they arrive at their destination country, as every border patrol officer has the right to determine the outcome,” Alwadish explained. “They may have travelers detained, pay a fine or let them pass.”  Taking that kind of risk in a foreign country is not advisable, he added. And there’s a long list of countries that have this rule in place. Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Germany, India, Belgium, South Africa, the Netherlands, Cuba, Iceland, Zimbabwe and Indonesia are among the destinations that require two blank pages. Countries that require one page include France, Japan, Mexico, Greece, Thailand, Australia, Morocco, Argentina and Vietnam, among others. But you’ll need at least three blank pages if you want to visit Namibia, Botswana, Madagascar and Zambia.  “While some pages may be full of stamps, others might have one ― and just one stamp means that that page is not empty,” Alwadish cautioned.  Advertisement  Immigration authorities in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have also emphasized that the “endorsement” pages found at the back of many passports are different from visa pages and thus do not count as blank pages for the purposes of entry and exit stamps. (Newer passports have the endorsement section closer to the front.)  Meanwhile, Armenia and Micronesia have no stated blank passport page requirements.  “Countries like Sweden and the Philippines don’t require a blank page on your passport, but rather sufficient space for entry and exit stamps,” Alwadish noted.  He recommended looking at the State Department’s website for a breakdown of the specific entry prerequisites for each country.  Advertisement  Jake Wyman via Getty Images Many avid travelers delight in their extensive collections of passport stamps, but it's important to check the blank page requirements before visiting an international destination.  Keep in mind that blank page rules don’t just apply to U.S. visitors, either.  “This is true for all incoming travelers to the country, regardless of nationality, based on requirements set by individual countries for incoming visitors,” Tanner said.  Over time, frequent travelers may not need to worry as much about having enough empty passport pages.  Advertisement  “The issue of blank passport pages will likely become less of a significant problem for travelers as more countries are phasing out manual stamping of physical passport books,” Alwadish said. “The European Union is spearheading this shift with the introduction of the Entry/Exit System, intended to expedite the border control process and improve data accuracy.”  He explained that this new system uses biometric technology to scan travelers’ fingerprints and faces at border checkpoints.  “This data will then be stored and used to verify their arrival and exits, cross referenced with their passport information, removing the necessity for physical passport stamps,” he said.  Advertisement  But for now, immigration officers still need to ensure there are enough pages for stamps and visas. So travelers must remain vigilant.  “It is always best to make sure your passport is valid and has at least two blank pages,” Alwadish noted. “If a traveler does not have enough blank pages available, they cannot add more to their physical book.”  As of 2016, the U.S. government does not allow travelers to add extra pages to their existing passports. If they need more pages, they must renew their passports.  Advertisement  People who often travel internationally might want to consider choosing the option for a bigger passport with more visa pages. It’s no extra cost, and all you have to do is check the box that says “large book” when you fill out the form.  If you have an impending trip abroad, there are ways to get a new passport in a rush on your own or by paying a third party for expedited service. And of course, the best way to avoid adding extra stress and hassle is to keep track of your passport and ensure it’s compliant throughout the year."

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.  The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.  ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us. He is controlled by a puppet government, by Bidzina Ivanishvili, by Putin,” protester Sandro Samkharadze said. Another protester waved a sign saying “We are children of Europe.”"

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads. Try and win an argument with any woman in Canada,” he said. “We’re pretty tough and resilient people.”"

Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon’s impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon’s impeachment was an outcome driven by “the people’s ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.”  Advertisement  Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, “We have preserved the constitutional order!”  In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached.

(AP Photo/Ahnn Young-joon) Ahn Young-joon via AP  The new leader bolsters the country’s security posture  Yoon issued a statement saying he would “never give up” and calling for officials to maintain stability in government functions during what he described as a “temporary” pause of his presidency.  “I will carry with me all the criticisms, encouragement and support directed toward me, and I will continue to do my utmost for the country until the very last moment,” Yoon said.  Advertisement  Han, who became the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han’s office.  South Korea’s executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade and finance and was the ambassador to the U.S. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.  Advertisement  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred.  Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law.  The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon “committed rebellion that hurts peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.” It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.  Advertisement  Yoon remains defiant  In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon had rejected the rebellion charges, calling his order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it “a monster” and “anti-state forces” that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.  Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a “mad declaration of war” against his own people.  Observers say Yoon’s speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon’s approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.  Advertisement  Some of Yoon’s claims don’t align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.  Most notably, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that after martial law was announced, Yoon called him and asked for his troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he didn’t carry out Yoon’s orders.  Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.  Advertisement  In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers. Roh jumped to his death in 2009, after he had left office, amid a corruption scandal involving his family.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea.  He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations."

Mangione has hired Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who for years worked in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office under Cyrus Vance Jr. before going into the private sector, to represent him in New York, as CNN first reported Friday and other outlets have since corroborated.  Advertisement  The shooting suspect remains in custody in Pennsylvania after his arrest there on charges such as forgery and illegal possession of a firearm. He is fighting extradition to New York, where he has been charged with second-degree murder.  HuffPost has reached out to Friedman Agnifilo for comment.  The news comes as officials say they have found new evidence in the case, with New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch stating that a 3D-printed gun Mangione possessed at the time of his Pennsylvania arrest matched three shell casings recovered at the Manhattan shooting scene.  His fingerprints also matched those that investigators found on a water bottle and granola bar wrapper located near the scene, police said.  Advertisement  Jennifer Rodgers, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, on Friday described Friedman Agnifilo as the “sort of person you want” to take on the case.  “What you want is a lawyer who can take you through the real case,” Rodgers told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, adding that “Karen is the sort of person with all of her many years of experience as a trial lawyer and in this actual courthouse and in this actual office.”  Friedman Agnifilo — in a CNN appearance Tuesday, before she was retained — predicted that there could be a “not guilty by reason of insanity” defense in the case, as the evidence is “going to be so overwhelming that he [the suspect] did what he did.”  Advertisement  “As a former prosecutor in that [Manhattan District Attorney’s Office] ... I would be concerned that you have someone who is a valedictorian of his class. He was brilliant his whole life. He comes from this great family. I mean, something changed, right? Significantly, something changed,” she said.  “And they’re going to, I think, potentially have a ‘not guilty by reason of insanity’ potential defense. So the prosecutors are going to try to shore that up as well in their investigation.”  Advertisement  Thomas Dickey, Mangione’s lawyer in Pennsylvania, has said that his client plans to plead not guilty in that state. Dickey said this week that he hadn’t yet seen evidence that would implicate his client  “I don’t even know if this is him or whatever,” Dickey said on Tuesday."

Mark Warner (D-Va.) said Monday at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit.  Advertisement  Warner said he wanted to know about Gabbard’s “interchange with Assad and seeming affinity for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” as well as her support for intel whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.  The Assad linkage is so widely discussed that Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to Mike Pence during his vice presidency, made a cutting joke on a Sunday morning political talk show, saying that the three people most worried by Assad’s recent downfall were “Putin, the ayatollah [of Iran] and Tulsi Gabbard.”  Gabbard, who was a member of Congress from 2013 to 2021, traveled to Syria in 2017 to meet with Assad in a trip that raised eyebrows.  Advertisement  After inheriting leadership of his country from his father, Assad was known for being a particularly brutal and corrupt dictator, even by Middle East standards. In 2013, his forces were accused of using sarin gas in an attack killing 1,400 people and of using barrel bombs — explosives that can be made from empty barrels and other scrap, along with gasoline and shrapnel — against civilians. His government’s expertise in torture led the U.S. to outsource interrogations of some terrorism suspects there during President George W. Bush’s “global war on terror.”  In the wake of Assad’s fall, some of the costs of his rule have come to light, with journalists documenting his fancy car collection and the release of people kept in the brutal Saydnaya prison.  Freedom House, a democracy advocacy group, gave Syria a score of only 1 out of 100 in its 2024 ranking of countries by how free they are, ahead of only Tibet and Nagorno-Karabakh (which Freedom House includes as disputed territories).  Advertisement  After her 2017 trip, Gabbard defended herself, saying any peace deal amid Syria’s civil war would need Assad’s sign-off.  “Whatever you think about President Assad, the fact is that he is the president of Syria,” she said then.  That changed over the weekend, when Assad fled the country and received asylum in Russia under the protection of fellow strongman Putin. His fall ended more than 50 years of family rule after a stunning 11-day rebel advance.  Advertisement  During her time in the House of Representatives, Gabbard often justified a light touch with Assad by citing the threat of victory by Islamic militants, who were among the rival factions challenging his governance in the civil war. That stance also seemed to conveniently diminish Assad’s culpability for likely war crimes.  “Let the Syrian people themselves determine their future, not the United States, not some foreign country,” she told CNN in 2017.  While the group that led the rebel coalition to take down Assad, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government and has been affiliated with al Qaeda in the past, the opening days of post-Assad Syria have not seen the fundamentalist Islamic crackdown some had feared.  Advertisement  On Monday, Gabbard told reporters that her views now aligned with Trump’s, who’s commented on Assad’s fall by saying that the U.S. should not get involved — an option that virtually no one had suggested.  “I stand in full support and wholeheartedly agree with the statements that President Trump has made over these last few days with regards to the developments in Syria,” Gabbard stated.  Here are some of the things Gabbard had said on the floor of the House, or later inserted as written statements in the Congressional Record, on the need to keep Assad from being toppled and what would happen after his fall:  Advertisement  May 2018  In advocating for removing language in an annual defense policy bill that approved developing a strategy to counter Iran, Gabbard said, “It’s clear that, if left unchecked, war hawks in the Trump administration will drag our country into more Middle East wars, leaving destruction in its wake around the world and here at home.”  She added: “So what’s the objective of this authorization for war? Is it regime change in Iran? Regime change in Syria? More war against Iran and Syria? Yemen?”  December 2016  Talking about her bill to prohibit the government from supporting foreign terror groups, Gabbard said the U.S. had for years been “directly and indirectly supporting allies and partners of groups like al Qaeda and ISIS with money, weapons, intelligence and other support in their fight to overthrow the Syrian government.”  Advertisement  “The Wall Street Journal reports that rebel groups are, quote, ‘doubling down on their alliance’ with al Qaeda. This alliance has rendered the phrase ‘moderate rebels’ meaningless. We must stop this madness,” she said.  June 2016  Speaking of a provision to equip and train rebel Syrian groups in a defense funding bill, Gabbard said the groups remained focused on overthrowing Assad, which would end up “creating an even worse humanitarian crisis and an even greater threat to the world.”  “We’re waging two wars in Syria, providing arms and support to groups that have opposing objectives,” she said. “The first war is a counterproductive one to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad, which must end. And the second is our war to defeat ISIS, al Qaeda and other jihadist groups, which we must win. By helping groups fighting to overthrow Assad, we’re essentially helping ISIS and al Qaeda achieve their objective of taking over all of Syria.”  Advertisement  March 2016  In discussing one of two Syria-related resolutions, Gabbard called it “a thinly veiled attempt to use the rationale of humanitarianism as a justification for overthrowing the Syrian government of Assad.”  “If the U.S. is successful in its current effort to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad, allowing groups like ISIS and al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations to take over all of Syria, which is what will happen, including those Assad-controlled areas where Christians and other religious minorities remain protected, the United States will be morally culpable for the genocide that will occur as a result,” she said.  “This is exactly what happened when we overthrew Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It is what happened in Libya when we overthrew Muammar Gaddafi. To do the same thing over and over and expect a different result is the definition of insanity.”  Advertisement  March 2016  In discussing another resolution, Gabbard said she objected specifically to language saying that “Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s violence against the Syrian people has attracted foreign fighters from around the world, who have supported and committed ISIL [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant] atrocities.”  “I fully reject this amendment to the resolution which gives moral legitimacy to the actions of ISIS, al-Qaeda, and others who are committing genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities in Syria,” she said.  December 2014  In debating an annual defense policy bill, Gabbard said a provision to train what were described as “moderate” Syrian rebels “seriously polluted this critical piece of legislation.”  Advertisement  “I could not in good conscience vote to support the so-called moderate forces who often work hand in hand with al Qaeda or ISIS, and whose personnel and weapons often end up in the hands of those terrorists,” she said. “This bill continues the same failed practices of undeclared war, regime change and nation-building that have held us mired in the Middle East for over a decade.”  September 2014  In debating an amendment to a stopgap spending bill to aid Syrian opposition, Gabbard said, “Voting to support this proposal is actually a vote to overthrow Assad because overthrowing Assad is the primary objective of the so-called Free Syrian Army.”  She added: “If we combine the missions of destroying ISIL and of overthrowing Assad, this is not a smart or effective strategy for a number of reasons. We must focus on one mission — to destroy ISIL and other Islamic extremists who’ve declared war on us. Our mission should not be to topple the Assad regime, which would make the situation in the region even worse and more unstable than it is today.”"

Left: Amazon MGM Studios; Right: Roadside Attractions  Unless folks are doing something like recording whole scenes of a movie on their cellphones, you generally don’t notice who else is in the audience with you at a movie theater. The lights fade to black, the screen brightens and everything — and everyone — around you virtually disappears. But sometimes taking stock of how others react to a film can tell you a lot about who becomes the arbiters of merit and why.  That’s especially true when you’re watching a Black movie.  An example that comes to mind is “12 Years a Slave,” which tells the harrowing true story of a free Black man who was abducted and sold into slavery in 1841. At a 2013 press screening for the film in Manhattan, an inclusive audience sat transfixed in front of the screen during multiple scenes of sexual and physical violence.  Advertisement  Perusing the theater during those moments revealed something interesting. Some Black viewers were stone-faced, while others seemed exhausted by the second or third brutality scene. Many of the white folks, though, were inconsolable — sobbing and blowing their noses. Perhaps that was on account of white guilt, a performative impulse, or because the film really is that stirring.  In any case, “12 Years a Slave,” a Steve McQueen-directed movie that unflinchingly portrays the horrors of white supremacy, was heralded by a predominantly white and so-called liberal Hollywood elite. And it went on to earn nine Oscar nominations.  There was another staggering Black drama released that same year that was also a nonfiction story dealing with systemic racism, though in a more modern context: “Fruitvale Station.” It earned exactly zero nominations from that same voting branch.  Advertisement  While the Ryan Coogler-directed film can hardly be accused of not engaging with the issue of whiteness through the lens of police brutality, there is a crucial difference between it and the aforementioned offering. It does not hinge on the racially motivated atrocity against its lead character or its perpetrator. Rather, it centers the Black human life that was cut short. It examines who the person was outside of the system of whiteness.  Ethan Herisse (left) and Brandon Wilson in ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  In essence, it’s not a film that necessarily brings white audiences into its story. It actually seems indifferent to whatever reaction they might have. A Hollywood voting establishment that, in spite of all its lip service, has always had an issue appreciating art that does not revolve around their lives or even their ills could see that as a detriment.  Advertisement  They often look for art they can laud that can at least give the appearance that they’re progressive despite showing all signs of the opposite. It’s a self-gratifying tactic that doesn’t serve the art at all, no matter how good it is.  It’s been over a decade since “12 Years a Slave” and “Fruitvale Station” were released, and white people’s proximity to a Black narrative still weighs heavily on their acclaim for it. This year’s “Nickel Boys” and “Exhibiting Forgiveness” are two other Black films that have had parallel journeys to the big screen and awards season. But their trajectories could not be more different — and for the same reason as their predecessors.  Similar to “12 Years a Slave,” “Nickel Boys,” an adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, is an unrelenting drama following the lives of two young Black men trying to survive an abusive and racist reform school in the 1960s. The performances are good. The movie’s technical merit, including its marvelous cinematography, has already helped it earn the attention of several awards bodies.  Advertisement  Despite it not even being released in limited theaters until Friday, there’s hardly a day that goes by in the last few months — since its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival this summer — that there isn’t press or hype about it. That includes numerous press screenings and initiatives.  But with the effects of systemic oppression being an impeding factor of the story, leaving little space to explore the characters’ humanity, it’s hard not to again wonder whether its appeal to arbitrated audiences is also that it is more for them to appreciate than others who might identify with their experiences.  André Holland (left) and Andra Day in ""Exhibiting Forgiveness."" Courtesy of Roadside Attractions  Advertisement  Director RaMell Ross said he didn’t intend for that to be the case, though. When the filmmaker was asked in an interview with Vanity Fair what his expectations are of audiences that are “older, very white and wealthier,” he replied that “Nickel Boys” “emerges from our centrality, and it ostensibly is for us, but I’m happy to give it to others.”  “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” on the other hand, doesn’t provoke that same question. It almost entirely wrestles with the complexities of its Black characters, and in ways Black audiences especially recognize. Systemic prejudices are understood as the reality in which they live, only because they are Black and it’s set in the present day, not because the plot informs that. There’s nary a moment when the film even gestures toward that to tell its story.  That helps create an intensely insulated film that centers a Black family whose drama is also deeply felt and astoundingly performed. The conflicts, joy and contradictions that propel the plot are of their own making — and not the result of a racially motivated antagonist. White people, come to think of it, are merely ornamental in the story.  Advertisement  It is unequivocally a film by and for Black people to grapple with among ourselves — one that has similarly affected Black audiences in the way “12 Years a Slave” moved white viewers. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” allows white audiences to enter its narrative incidentally only, while films like “Nickel Boys” and “12 Years a Slave” often engage directly with their white audiences through their own historical (and present-day) examination.  It’s a distinction that often results in the latter films being considered worthy of Hollywood’s highest honors.  Taking a look at the theatrical and post-theatrical odysseys of “Exhibiting Forgiveness” and “Nickel Boys” might help bring this into further focus. “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is an original story that was amazingly green-lit in our sequel- and adaptation-obsessed culture and based on the personal experiences of writer-director Titus Kaphar, a first-time feature filmmaker.  Advertisement  “Nickel Boys” came with all the fanfare of a known author, an acclaimed literary honor under its belt and at least the assumption that its Jim Crow-era setting means that whiteness could obviously play a significant role in the story. Even Ross’ avant-garde filmmaking that shifts the camera and perspective between the two lead characters couldn’t deter an audience that was already locked in.  Herisse stars as Elwood in a moment from ""Nickel Boys."" Courtesy of Orion Pictures  Ross also told Vanity Fair that the process between the film being green-lit and going into production through Orion Pictures and Amazon MGM Studios was fairly smooth, to his own surprise. And since its Telluride premiere just a few months ago, “Nickel Boys” has experienced a constant whirlwind of praise from various awards bodies and audiences.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, Kaphar told me during an interview that “it was a fight” to get “Exhibiting Forgiveness” released in theaters. Like many filmmakers, especially Black filmmakers whose work is too often considered niche, Kaphar was approached about bringing the film to a streaming service.  Despite earning rave reviews following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, it went months without being acquired, and then months later — not until October — it was released by Roadside Attractions. By then, many people had forgotten about it or just hadn’t heard much about it at all.  Save from a video-on-demand release and awards screeners available to voting press, the film hasn’t been able to achieve any major award nominations and hasn’t popped up on most “best of 2024” lists. (It made HuffPost’s roundup.) Unlike “Fruitvale Station,” it also failed to earn an Independent Spirit Award nomination or other award precursor nominations.  Advertisement  None of this discussion is to elevate any one Black film above another, suggest that a certain kind of Black film is better than the next, or even pit two films against each other. Both can and should be in the conversation. It is to question the deciding bodies that dictate the merit of Black films and have an honest conversation about what actually motivates their choices."

(Don't Be Embarrassed, It's Normal.)","Cavan Images via Getty Images Flatulence from your vagina during sex or physical activities like yoga is common and nothing to be ashamed of.  Queefing, as anyone with a vagina will tell you, can happen at some inopportune times: while you’re having sex, in the middle of a yoga class or during a visit to the gynecologist.  You may have heard some people refer to queefs as “vaginal farts” (charming). But while queefs do produce a toot-like sound, we can assure you that queefing is not the same as passing gas.  Advertisement  We talked to gynecologists and sex therapists to learn more about what causes queefs, some of the misconceptions about them and why they shouldn’t be as mortifying as we make them out to be.  What makes you queef, anyway?  Queefing is an involuntary bodily function that occurs when air is pushed into the vagina, gets temporarily trapped in the folds of the vaginal canal (called rugae) and is then released.  Advertisement  “Queefing happens when a penis, fingers or sex toy go in and out of the vagina bringing additional air along with it,” Sherry A. Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, California and the author of “She-ology: The Definitive Guide to Women’s Intimate Health,” told HuffPost. “Sex can involve a lot of thrusting of the penis in and out of the vagina, typically pushing extra air into a dead-end space.”  Certain sex positions, like doggy style where your pelvis is titled upwards, or abruptly switching from one position to another, may increase the likelihood of queefing. Even non-sexual activities, like putting in a tampon or menstrual cup, practicing yoga (like when you move out of an inversion pose) or your gyno inserting a speculum can lead to queefing.  “From my experience as an OB-GYN, almost every woman has experienced at least one episode of queefing some time during her life, sometimes even during a pelvic exam,” said Diana Hoppe, an OB-GYN in Encinitas, California.  While the gas that comes out of your rectum may have a foul odor (a result of bacterial activity in the gut), queefs are odorless, Hoppe added.  Advertisement  Can you prevent a queef?  And as OB-GYN Sheila Loanzon told Cosmopolitan, “If you try to contract the vaginal canal to prevent air from coming in, it can cause sex to be more painful.”  Advertisement  “Also, when doing any abdominal exercises or weight-bearing exercise, it is important to squeeze the pelvic floor while holding the core abdominal muscles tight,” Hoppe said. “Many women squeeze abdominal muscles but do not activate the pelvic floor at the same time, thus allowing the pelvic floor to sag, increasing the likelihood of air entering into vaginal canal.”  During sex, keeping the penis, fingers or sex toy inside you while you change positions could lessen your chances of queefing because it “gives air less of an opportunity to get into the vagina,” Jamil Abdur-Rahman, an OB-GYN and the chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vista Health System in Waukegan, Illinois, told Self.  Advertisement  And in theory, you could just avoid certain sex or yoga positions altogether. But what’s the fun in that?  When queefing does happen, don’t sweat it.  So why does this very normal bodily function feel so embarrassing in the moment, be it during doggy-style or downward dog? It really just comes down to that pesky noise, Hoppe said.  “The stigma is due to lack of understanding the difference between release of air from the vagina and flatulence,” she said. “The sound effects may be the same though, so culturally there may be a stigma or embarrassment due to this occurring ‘down there.’”  Advertisement  Sex therapist Vanessa Marin underscored the fact that queefing is normal, common and “not anything to be ashamed of.” Embracing the awkwardness of the moment can even make sex more enjoyable for both partners.  “Our bodies make funny noises sometimes, and that’s OK!” she said. “Plus, there are plenty of other goofy things about sex, like getting sweaty, slipping out, getting into awkward positions and so on. The more we can laugh about these kinds of things, the more fun we’ll have during sex.”  When a queef slips out mid-coitus, you have two choices: ignore that deflating balloon sound completely or quickly acknowledge it and move on. Marin prefers the latter route.  Advertisement  “It’s a personal preference, but I think it’s better to just quickly acknowledge it and laugh it off,” she said. “That way you don’t have to sit there thinking about it, anxiously wondering whether or not your partner heard it.”  Is queefing ever cause for concern?  Generally, queefing is nothing to be worried about. While rare, if queefing is accompanied by pain or a bad smell, you should make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any more serious issues.  “If queefing is associated with a foul odor, it may be an indication of a vaginal infection or possible fistula, an [abnormal] connection between rectum and vagina due to previous radiation treatment or surgery that causes stool or feces to come out of the vagina,” Hoppe said.  Advertisement  But for the most part, queefing is a normal, if slightly awkward, fact of life. So let’s not get so hung up on it, OK?"

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  Advertisement  Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.  The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.  In this image taken from video provided by MartyA45_, several drones appear to be flying over Randolph, N.J., on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. MartyA45_ via AP  Advertisement  What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?  Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.  At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.  But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.  The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.  Advertisement  Drones have been spotted over New York City  Drone sightings have now been reported in New York City, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.  The runways at Stewart International Airport – about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of New York City — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.  “This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.  The governor called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity.  Advertisement  “Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”  This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP,  Are these drones dangerous?  The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.  Advertisement  The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.  Who sent the drones?  Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.  The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.  Advertisement  Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.  Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.  The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.  Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remains unchanged.  Advertisement  Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.  What have officials said about the mysterious drone sightings?  President-elect Donald Trump has posted that he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.  U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Thursday said the drowns should be “shot down, if necessary,” even as it remains unclear who owns the unmanned aircraft.  “We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.  Advertisement  Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Are drones allowed in New Jersey?  The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.  Advertisement  In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.  Operators must be FAA certified.  Have drones been spotted anywhere else?  Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.  Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.  The flying object was over the ocean and they watched as it slowly moved over a Virginia Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.  “It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.  Advertisement  “It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.  The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the facility’s area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation, Puryear said.  Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of drone sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said in an email Friday.  Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.  Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

(AP) — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.  Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.  Advertisement  This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what’s behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.  More drone sightings have been reported in New York City, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.

(Trisha Bushey via AP) Trisha Bushey via AP  Advertisement  But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.  Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.  In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.  The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.  Advertisement  One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)  Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.  “I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.  She doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”  Advertisement  “How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”  Then there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.  Olivia DeMattio, outside Simple Coffee in Mendham, New Jersey on Thursday, December 12, 2024, is one of many New Jersey residents who have seen large drones at night over their houses and businesses. AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey  Advertisement  Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.  Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.  “It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”  Federal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.  Advertisement  That’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.  For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.  “My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.

Clinically speaking, menopause is reached when you’ve gone 12 straight months without a period, marking the end of one’s reproductive years. The average age of the last menstrual period is 51, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The loss of estrogen during menopause can cause the vaginal and vulvar tissue to become thinner, dryer and less stretchy, which can lead to pain during sexual activity, Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health and medical director of The Menopause Society, told HuffPost.  And while there is a lot of discussion about the challenges of sex after menopause, it may be comforting to know that it’s definitely not all doom and gloom.  “The good news is that most women who had a good sex life before menopause can continue to enjoy a good sex life after menopause,” Faubion said.  Advertisement  Westend61 via Getty Images ""Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying,"" said midlife sex coach Sonia Wright.  In fact, it’s a myth that women stop being sexual once menopause hits, midlife sex coach Sonia Wright told HuffPost.  Menopause “can actually be the beginning of something amazing; even better than sex in your 20s and 30s,” she said. “You get to be a sexual being until the day you leave this world. Postmenopausal sex can be even more intimate, connective, pleasurable and very satisfying.”  Advertisement  If you are struggling with your sexual well-being around menopause, reach out to your health care provider to discuss causes and potential treatment options tailored to your needs. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, sex therapy, hormone therapy, and lifestyle changes like incorporating yoga may help.  Below, women share their personal experiences with sex after menopause. Note: Some last names have been omitted to protect their privacy. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.  ‘The only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate.’  “I was around 52 when menopause symptoms started, and it’s now been close to two years postmenopause. When my monthly cycle started to become irregular, I realized menopause was beginning. I did a bit of reading on what to expect, and two of the possible issues I came across were lack or loss of sex drive and vaginal dryness. The worst symptom for me was hot flashes, and I was fortunate that I didn’t need any hormone replacement therapy.  I have always had a relatively high sex drive and sex is important to me, whether in a relationship or not. My sex drive has remained high, and I enjoy a healthy and safe sex life even though I am single. Even though pregnancy is no longer an issue, I always use condoms and get tested for STIs yearly. I have had no issues regarding vaginal dryness and do not need any lubricant for vaginal sex.  For me, the only thing that changed was knowing what I want from a sexual relationship, and what I will and won’t tolerate. Life is too short for bad sex!  Advertisement  What has surprised me is that I find myself attracted to men who are younger than me. I had always dated older. All of my sexual encounters since menopause and becoming single are with younger men ranging in age from 39-50 years of age.” — Kim P., 56, Queensland, Australia  ‘I dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman.’  “I think I was around 55 when I started going through menopause. I noticed I wasn’t really interested in sex, but I wasn’t sure if it was my circumstances — I was in the middle of a divorce — or ‘The Pause.’ After my yearly gynecologist visit, where my doctor told me about vaginal atrophy and a few other midlife issues that might arise, I just gave up on sex.  But at age 65, I briefly dated a gentleman who made me realize I was still a sexy, vital, vibrant woman. Sex was fun again! So I’m not sure if it was menopause that made me ‘think’ I no longer was interested in sex/intimacy, or if it was my mind and society. Whatever the case, I’m ready for dating and this next new chapter. Bring it on!” — Brenda B., 67, New York City  Advertisement  ‘Now I’m having the best sex of my life.’  “I’ve been postmenopausal for a couple of years at least. Now I’m having the best sex of my life. It’s largely due to the fact that I know exactly what I want. And I feel entitled to say, ‘This is what I want. And this is how I want it.’ And to also say, ‘No, that’s not what I want’ — even if it’s pretty minor. I just know what I want, and I know how to ask for it and to be demanding in a good way.  I had actually very few menopausal challenges, although I started acupuncture early. I’ve done regular acupuncture for probably 20 years now. And my acupuncturist’s goal from the beginning was like, ‘Let’s keep your cycle as regular as we possibly can for as long as we possibly can.’ And I think that was hugely helpful to me: having her support and having her focus on my hormones, to keep them going in the right way. So that’s what I recommend — not necessarily acupuncture — but don’t try to go through menopause solo. Get support, whatever support you can find, that will work for you.  As a sex coach, I’m a huge proponent of masturbation. Because that way, you know your whole body and that really empowers you then to say, ‘This is what really works for me.’ There’s a quality of ‘use it or lose it.’ So if you’re not in a partnership, and you’re not having regular sex and you’re not masturbating, you’re just not ‘juicing your flow,’ basically.  Advertisement  Find the vibrators that work for you. There are so many available right now: vibrators, dildos, combos. I encourage my clients to do “The O 30”: Masturbate 30 days straight, and see what you learn and see what changes in your life.” — Dori Melton, 58, Oakland, California  The Good Brigade via Getty Images Sex postmenopause may be different, but it doesn't have to be lackluster.  ‘My libido actually surged at menopause.’  “I didn’t have expectations about how sex would be after menopause. I had never heard that it might change due to menopause. I think that was positive in that I didn’t internalize stereotypes about inevitable libido changes. My libido actually surged at menopause. But it was also negative in that I had not heard about common postmenopausal physical symptoms such as thinning of vulvar and vaginal tissues, often referred to as a sensation of dryness.  Advertisement  So when I began to experience pain with penetration after menopause, my ignorance resulted in a longer-than-necessary time to diagnosis and treatment after trying various types of lube that did not address the underlying issue. I came to learn that this condition (urogenital atrophy) is very common postmenopause and usually easily treated, but it is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Sometimes considerable self-advocacy is required. In my case, insertable vaginal estrogen effectively resolved my symptoms and has prevented recurrence of symptoms with ongoing use.  Aside from the temporary physical symptoms I experienced, sex after menopause has mostly been as good and often better than sex prior to menopause. Reasons for this likely include increased sexual confidence; greater experience with sex, relationships and communication; a consistent standard of mutual desire and enthusiasm; some exploration with a variety of interesting partners; and increased privacy as my children have become adults.  In my experience, generally speaking, choice in sex partner(s) can make a tremendous difference in how a woman might experience sex. This is true in any stage of life, though there are some stages and circumstances I believe are particularly fragile, such as early sexual experiences, sex post-childbirth, sex approaching menopause when hormones are erratic, sex postmenopause, and sex during ill health or while processing grief.

Research is offering some actionable steps we can take to protect our minds from memory loss.  A large UK-based study published in the American Academy of Neurology’s medical journal found that physical and mental activities ― such as doing household chores, exercising or visiting loved ones may help lower the risk of dementia.  The roughly 11-year study followed 501,376 people in the UK who self-reported their physical and mental activities at the beginning of the experiment: how often they visit with friends, their education level, how often they climb stairs, how they commute to work, and more.  Advertisement  The study found certain activities were associated with a lower risk of dementia. People who frequently exercised had a 35% lower risk, people who frequently did household chores had a 21% lower risk and people who visited daily with family and friends had a 15% lower risk.  And while dementia risk factors also include things that are out of our control ― like aging and genetics ― the research underscores that there are behaviors within your power to either reduce your risk of dementia or delay the condition, Dr. Scott Turner, director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told HuffPost.  Advertisement  The study does come with a few caveats: The findings are a correlation, not necessarily a direct link. Another limitation is that because people reported their own physical and mental activities, there’s always a chance that some people forgot about activities they engaged in or reported them incorrectly.  “More research is needed to confirm our findings. However, our results are encouraging that making these simple lifestyle changes may be beneficial,” study author Dr. Huan Song of Sichuan University in China, said in a statement.  Overall, the results are good news, considering more than 5 million people in the United States live with dementia — and that number is only expected to grow.  Keeping your brain stimulated is key.  Whether through physical activity, social activity or mental activity, putting your brain to work can help delay dementia onset or reduce the risk altogether.  Advertisement  Chores double as both a physical and mental activity (and can even sometimes be considered exercise, Turner noted). Visits with loved ones are a social activity that also requires mental stimulation, and physical activity requires mental dedication, too.  Turner said that people who develop visual or hearing problems could be at a higher risk of dementia if they don’t address the problem by getting glasses or hearing aids. When you can’t hear or see, he explained, “you’re depriving your brain of sensory input, and you need to keep your brain stimulated” to help reduce your risk of dementia.  Morsa Images via Getty Images Physical activity is one way to help decrease your risk of dementia.  Advertisement  Physical activity has a double benefit when it comes to dementia risk.  Another risk factor for dementia is diabetes, Turner noted, and there are lifestyle patterns you can follow to reduce your risk of diabetes. These include exercising, following a healthy diet and maintaining an ideal body weight throughout your lifetime.  So, not only does exercise help slash your risk of dementia, but it also helps slash your risk of diabetes, which, in itself, puts you at risk for memory loss.  It’s never too late to implement these changes.  Turner stressed that no matter your age, it’s never too late to start following some of these lifestyle recommendations. And that can be as simple as doing some extra vacuuming around the house or going for a walk with your neighbor, for example.  Advertisement  “I recommend doing as much as possible with lifestyle [changes] to avoid and prevent dementia,” he said. “And, of course, prevention is better than treatment.”  For those who already have memory problems or dementia, Turner said lifestyle changes that require physical, social or mental activity are still beneficial. You can help slow down the progression of dementia by keeping your brain stimulated. This is why puzzles are a popular activity among people with Alzheimer’s disease.  If you experience any new memory problems, talk to your doctor.  “If someone does develop memory problems, then they certainly should seek evaluation starting with their primary care provider,” Turner said.

If you’re an avid traveler, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your passport fill up with stamps, turning that once-blank travel document into a nostalgic little memory book.  But as delightful as it is to have a paper trail of evidence of your past adventures, your large stamp collection could lead to issues on future trips if you don’t pay close attention. That’s all due to a passport validity rule that many people overlook.  Advertisement  “One rule many travelers miss is needing an adequate number of blank pages in their passport for visas, and entry and exit stamps,” David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com, told HuffPost. “This is often forgotten, especially by those with passports close to expiring or having only a few blank pages.”  The U.S. State Department did not set the blank pages rule, which stems from other countries’ requirements for international visitors.  “Some countries require passports to have at least two to four blank visa or stamp pages, and thus, some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met,” said Caroline Tanner, a trends writer at The Points Guy.  Advertisement  Just as travelers often need to have at least three to six months of passport validity beyond the dates of an international trip, they may also need to have a certain number of empty pages depending on the requirements at their destination.  “The basis for this rule is maintaining proper security measures and part of the entry and exit requirements,” Alwadish said. “Not meeting this requirement can cause problems at borders. If the traveler does not have the required blank pages in the passport, the passport will technically be invalid and the person may not be allowed to board the plane.”  He emphasized that airlines can bar passengers who do not meet the requirement from boarding their flights to avoid complications at the international destination.  Advertisement  “If for whatever reason it is overlooked in the U.S., the traveler may take a big risk once they arrive at their destination country, as every border patrol officer has the right to determine the outcome,” Alwadish explained. “They may have travelers detained, pay a fine or let them pass.”  Taking that kind of risk in a foreign country is not advisable, he added. And there’s a long list of countries that have this rule in place. Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Germany, India, Belgium, South Africa, the Netherlands, Cuba, Iceland, Zimbabwe and Indonesia are among the destinations that require two blank pages. Countries that require one page include France, Japan, Mexico, Greece, Thailand, Australia, Morocco, Argentina and Vietnam, among others. But you’ll need at least three blank pages if you want to visit Namibia, Botswana, Madagascar and Zambia.  “While some pages may be full of stamps, others might have one ― and just one stamp means that that page is not empty,” Alwadish cautioned.  Advertisement  Immigration authorities in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have also emphasized that the “endorsement” pages found at the back of many passports are different from visa pages and thus do not count as blank pages for the purposes of entry and exit stamps. (Newer passports have the endorsement section closer to the front.)  Meanwhile, Armenia and Micronesia have no stated blank passport page requirements.  “Countries like Sweden and the Philippines don’t require a blank page on your passport, but rather sufficient space for entry and exit stamps,” Alwadish noted.  He recommended looking at the State Department’s website for a breakdown of the specific entry prerequisites for each country.  Advertisement  Jake Wyman via Getty Images Many avid travelers delight in their extensive collections of passport stamps, but it's important to check the blank page requirements before visiting an international destination.  Keep in mind that blank page rules don’t just apply to U.S. visitors, either.  “This is true for all incoming travelers to the country, regardless of nationality, based on requirements set by individual countries for incoming visitors,” Tanner said.  Over time, frequent travelers may not need to worry as much about having enough empty passport pages.  Advertisement  “The issue of blank passport pages will likely become less of a significant problem for travelers as more countries are phasing out manual stamping of physical passport books,” Alwadish said. “The European Union is spearheading this shift with the introduction of the Entry/Exit System, intended to expedite the border control process and improve data accuracy.”  He explained that this new system uses biometric technology to scan travelers’ fingerprints and faces at border checkpoints.  “This data will then be stored and used to verify their arrival and exits, cross referenced with their passport information, removing the necessity for physical passport stamps,” he said.  Advertisement  But for now, immigration officers still need to ensure there are enough pages for stamps and visas. So travelers must remain vigilant.  “It is always best to make sure your passport is valid and has at least two blank pages,” Alwadish noted. “If a traveler does not have enough blank pages available, they cannot add more to their physical book.”  As of 2016, the U.S. government does not allow travelers to add extra pages to their existing passports. If they need more pages, they must renew their passports.  Advertisement  People who often travel internationally might want to consider choosing the option for a bigger passport with more visa pages. It’s no extra cost, and all you have to do is check the box that says “large book” when you fill out the form.  If you have an impending trip abroad, there are ways to get a new passport in a rush on your own or by paying a third party for expedited service. And of course, the best way to avoid adding extra stress and hassle is to keep track of your passport and ensure it’s compliant throughout the year."

Dec. 14, 2024. (AP Photo) via Associated Press  TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia.  Kavelashvili, 53, was the only candidate on the ballot and easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures.  Advertisement  Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have since boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot.  Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to “reset” ties with Russia.  In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Advertisement  Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held.  Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the European Union added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests.

Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004.  Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her.  Advertisement  “I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,” she has declared on the social network X. “My mandate continues.”  Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence.  “We are not demanding a revolution,” Zourabichvili said. “We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.”  Advertisement  “Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,” she said.  Zourabichvili called Saturday’s vote a “provocation” and “a parody” while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional.  Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is “the only legitimate source of power.”  Advertisement  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze meanwhile said that Kavelashvili’s election “will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.”  “The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,” said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream.

Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia’s opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls.  Kavelashvili was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric.  Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power,” similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.  Advertisement  The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the “foreign influence” law.  How did opposition protests unfold?  Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28.  Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard.  Advertisement  Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries.  Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies.  The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.  ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us. He is controlled by a puppet government, by Bidzina Ivanishvili, by Putin,” protester Sandro Samkharadze said. Another protester waved a sign saying “We are children of Europe.”"

Charlie Angus, a member of the left-leaning New Democratic Party who serves in the Canadian Parliament, said in an interview released Friday that his response was a “really simple” matter of “standing up and saying no.”  Advertisement  “We’re going to have tough negotiations, fair play. But this kind of dismissive, idiotic behavior? I mean, he’s a juvenile,” Angus told Ben Meiselas of the MeidasTouch Network in reference to Trump.  His comments arrive after Trump, who has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, has blamed those two countries for migrants and fentanyl “pouring” into America.  The U.S. president-elect, whose Florida estate received a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month, reportedly suggested during the meeting that Canada could become the “51st state” if the proposed tariffs kill its economy, in a remark that purportedly got nervous laughter out of Trudeau and others.  Advertisement  Earlier this week, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to mock Trudeau, a member of Canada’s Liberal Party, by referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada.”  Canadian officials have pushed back against Trump’s tariff threats.  Ontario — Canada’s most populous province and home to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which bills itself as “one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world” — could restrict LCBO from buying U.S.-made alcohol and also restrict electricity exports if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, a senior official in the province reportedly said Thursday.  Angus, in Tuesday remarks in the Canadian House of Commons, had said that his country has previously “stood up” to America despite the two nations being “neighbors.”  Advertisement  “We’re in a different situation with Donald Trump,” Angus said, adding that Trump is “seriously undermining the democratic process in the United States, and he thinks he can just push us around. He insults us.”  He also remarked: “We need to stand up to Donald Trump. Not to be boasting like he boasts and not to be threatening like he threatens, but to stand for Canadian values. That, no, we will counter falsehood with truth. That we will be a good neighbor, that we will protect our border but that we will not be pushed around.”  Angus told Meiselas that Canadians are “not going to be slapped around.”  “There’s a tradition in Canada of not wanting to be openly confrontive, which is fair — I think that’s who we are,” he said. “But Donald Trump’s a different kind of animal. He’s playing for the rage algorithms, and I don’t think we should allow him that free rein.”  Advertisement  He later invited Trump to visit Canada “anytime in the winter.”  “Try and drive our roads. Try and win an argument with any woman in Canada,” he said. “We’re pretty tough and resilient people.”"

(South Korean Presidential Office/Yonhap via AP) via AP  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s parliament on Saturday impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his stunning and short-lived martial law decree, a move that ended days of political paralysis but set up an intense debate over Yoon’s fate, as jubilant crowds roared to celebrate another defiant moment in the country’s resilient democracy.  The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85. Yoon’s presidential powers and duties were subsequently suspended and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s No. 2 official, took over presidential powers later Saturday.  Advertisement  The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he’s thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon’s impeachment after ruling party lawmakers boycotted it last Saturday. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon’s impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon’s impeachment was an outcome driven by “the people’s ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.”  Advertisement  Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, “We have preserved the constitutional order!”  In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached.

Advertisement  Han, who became the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han’s office.  South Korea’s executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade and finance and was the ambassador to the U.S. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.  Advertisement  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred.  Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law.  The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon “committed rebellion that hurts peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.” It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.  Advertisement  Yoon remains defiant  In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon had rejected the rebellion charges, calling his order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it “a monster” and “anti-state forces” that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.  Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a “mad declaration of war” against his own people.  Observers say Yoon’s speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon’s approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.  Advertisement  Some of Yoon’s claims don’t align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.  Most notably, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that after martial law was announced, Yoon called him and asked for his troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he didn’t carry out Yoon’s orders.  Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.  Advertisement  In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers. Roh jumped to his death in 2009, after he had left office, amid a corruption scandal involving his family.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea.  He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations."

I would be concerned that you have someone who is a valedictorian of his class. He was brilliant his whole life. He comes from this great family. I mean, something changed, right?

Mark Warner (D-Va.) said Monday at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit.  Advertisement  Warner said he wanted to know about Gabbard’s “interchange with Assad and seeming affinity for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” as well as her support for intel whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.  The Assad linkage is so widely discussed that Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to Mike Pence during his vice presidency, made a cutting joke on a Sunday morning political talk show, saying that the three people most worried by Assad’s recent downfall were “Putin, the ayatollah [of Iran] and Tulsi Gabbard.”  Gabbard, who was a member of Congress from 2013 to 2021, traveled to Syria in 2017 to meet with Assad in a trip that raised eyebrows.  Advertisement  After inheriting leadership of his country from his father, Assad was known for being a particularly brutal and corrupt dictator, even by Middle East standards. In 2013, his forces were accused of using sarin gas in an attack killing 1,400 people and of using barrel bombs — explosives that can be made from empty barrels and other scrap, along with gasoline and shrapnel — against civilians. His government’s expertise in torture led the U.S. to outsource interrogations of some terrorism suspects there during President George W. Bush’s “global war on terror.”  In the wake of Assad’s fall, some of the costs of his rule have come to light, with journalists documenting his fancy car collection and the release of people kept in the brutal Saydnaya prison.  Freedom House, a democracy advocacy group, gave Syria a score of only 1 out of 100 in its 2024 ranking of countries by how free they are, ahead of only Tibet and Nagorno-Karabakh (which Freedom House includes as disputed territories).  Advertisement  After her 2017 trip, Gabbard defended herself, saying any peace deal amid Syria’s civil war would need Assad’s sign-off.  “Whatever you think about President Assad, the fact is that he is the president of Syria,” she said then.  That changed over the weekend, when Assad fled the country and received asylum in Russia under the protection of fellow strongman Putin. His fall ended more than 50 years of family rule after a stunning 11-day rebel advance.  Advertisement  During her time in the House of Representatives, Gabbard often justified a light touch with Assad by citing the threat of victory by Islamic militants, who were among the rival factions challenging his governance in the civil war. That stance also seemed to conveniently diminish Assad’s culpability for likely war crimes.  “Let the Syrian people themselves determine their future, not the United States, not some foreign country,” she told CNN in 2017.  While the group that led the rebel coalition to take down Assad, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government and has been affiliated with al Qaeda in the past, the opening days of post-Assad Syria have not seen the fundamentalist Islamic crackdown some had feared.  Advertisement  On Monday, Gabbard told reporters that her views now aligned with Trump’s, who’s commented on Assad’s fall by saying that the U.S. should not get involved — an option that virtually no one had suggested.  “I stand in full support and wholeheartedly agree with the statements that President Trump has made over these last few days with regards to the developments in Syria,” Gabbard stated.  Here are some of the things Gabbard had said on the floor of the House, or later inserted as written statements in the Congressional Record, on the need to keep Assad from being toppled and what would happen after his fall:  Advertisement  May 2018  In advocating for removing language in an annual defense policy bill that approved developing a strategy to counter Iran, Gabbard said, “It’s clear that, if left unchecked, war hawks in the Trump administration will drag our country into more Middle East wars, leaving destruction in its wake around the world and here at home.”  She added: “So what’s the objective of this authorization for war? Is it regime change in Iran? Regime change in Syria? More war against Iran and Syria? Yemen?”  December 2016  Talking about her bill to prohibit the government from supporting foreign terror groups, Gabbard said the U.S. had for years been “directly and indirectly supporting allies and partners of groups like al Qaeda and ISIS with money, weapons, intelligence and other support in their fight to overthrow the Syrian government.”  Advertisement  “The Wall Street Journal reports that rebel groups are, quote, ‘doubling down on their alliance’ with al Qaeda. This alliance has rendered the phrase ‘moderate rebels’ meaningless. We must stop this madness,” she said.  June 2016  Speaking of a provision to equip and train rebel Syrian groups in a defense funding bill, Gabbard said the groups remained focused on overthrowing Assad, which would end up “creating an even worse humanitarian crisis and an even greater threat to the world.”  “We’re waging two wars in Syria, providing arms and support to groups that have opposing objectives,” she said. “The first war is a counterproductive one to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad, which must end. And the second is our war to defeat ISIS, al Qaeda and other jihadist groups, which we must win. By helping groups fighting to overthrow Assad, we’re essentially helping ISIS and al Qaeda achieve their objective of taking over all of Syria.”  Advertisement  March 2016  In discussing one of two Syria-related resolutions, Gabbard called it “a thinly veiled attempt to use the rationale of humanitarianism as a justification for overthrowing the Syrian government of Assad.”  “If the U.S. is successful in its current effort to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad, allowing groups like ISIS and al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations to take over all of Syria, which is what will happen, including those Assad-controlled areas where Christians and other religious minorities remain protected, the United States will be morally culpable for the genocide that will occur as a result,” she said.  “This is exactly what happened when we overthrew Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It is what happened in Libya when we overthrew Muammar Gaddafi. To do the same thing over and over and expect a different result is the definition of insanity.”  Advertisement  March 2016  In discussing another resolution, Gabbard said she objected specifically to language saying that “Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s violence against the Syrian people has attracted foreign fighters from around the world, who have supported and committed ISIL [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant] atrocities.”  “I fully reject this amendment to the resolution which gives moral legitimacy to the actions of ISIS, al-Qaeda, and others who are committing genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities in Syria,” she said.  December 2014  In debating an annual defense policy bill, Gabbard said a provision to train what were described as “moderate” Syrian rebels “seriously polluted this critical piece of legislation.”  Advertisement  “I could not in good conscience vote to support the so-called moderate forces who often work hand in hand with al Qaeda or ISIS, and whose personnel and weapons often end up in the hands of those terrorists,” she said. “This bill continues the same failed practices of undeclared war, regime change and nation-building that have held us mired in the Middle East for over a decade.”  September 2014  In debating an amendment to a stopgap spending bill to aid Syrian opposition, Gabbard said, “Voting to support this proposal is actually a vote to overthrow Assad because overthrowing Assad is the primary objective of the so-called Free Syrian Army.”  She added: “If we combine the missions of destroying ISIL and of overthrowing Assad, this is not a smart or effective strategy for a number of reasons. We must focus on one mission — to destroy ISIL and other Islamic extremists who’ve declared war on us. Our mission should not be to topple the Assad regime, which would make the situation in the region even worse and more unstable than it is today.”"

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-rookie-xavier-worthy-calls-dream-come-true-having-patrick-mahomes-his-quarterback,Fox News,right,Trending,Chiefs rookie Xavier Worthy calls it 'dream come true' having Patrick Mahomes as his quarterback,"Every rookie entering the NFL wishes to make an immediate impact on their team, especially first-round picks who carry loads of expectation when they hear their names called by Commissioner Roger Goodell on Draft night.  After breaking the 40-yard dash record at the NFL Scouting Combine, Xavier Worthy raised his draft stock, entering that zone of being a potential first-round pick.  All offseason, the Kansas City Chiefs were among teams looking for another playmaker to work with Patrick Mahomes on offense. With the 28th overall pick in hand, Worthy was still available, and they wasted no time adding his speed to the roster.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  While being over the moon that he was selected in the first round, Worthy quickly realized he had a two-time MVP, three-time Super Bowl champion and six-time Pro Bowl quarterback that would be throwing him the football.  One can guess how he feels about that after 13 games and a 12-1 record.  ""It’s kinda like a dream come true,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital ahead of Week 15.  CHIEFS ROOKIE XAVIER WORTHY SAYS TEAM THRIVES PLAYING IN VILLAIN ROLE: ‘EVERYBODY JUST WANTS US TO LOSE’  Worthy understood there was no time to geek out over Mahomes being his new signal caller. It was time to get to work, and he quickly realized that all the winning that comes with being a Chief is business at the end of the day.  ""You see why they win when you’re here,"" Worthy explained. ""They work hard, they go about their business the right way. They have the slogan called ‘The Formula’ – I feel like Coach Reid has hit [on] that in an interview. They really go about that every day, and I feel like it says a lot about the program.""  Of course, Worthy was not guaranteed to slot right in and get working with Mahomes immediately. First, he had to learn the playbook and then develop chemistry with his new quarterback on the practice field and in games.  Well, his first touch of his career, Worthy took an end-around flip from Mahomes to the house for a 21-yard rushing touchdown against the Baltimore Ravens.  Since then, Worthy has totaled 38 receptions on 67 targets for 448 yards with four touchdowns through the air, as well as 54 rushing yards and two touchdowns on the ground.  He feels the trust a quarterback needs in his receiver is there, leading to some pretty good first-year numbers.  ""Pat, he’s more of a guy that’s like, if you show you can go out there and do it, and he trusts you, and you earn his trust, he’s going to trust you throughout the season,"" Worthy said about Mahomes. ""I feel like I’ve earned his trust, and I feel like we’ve got something good rolling.""  A prime example of that came in the latest close-game victory for the Chiefs, which required Mahomes to orchestrate another game-winning drive.  On fourth-and-6 with the game on the line, Mahomes was scrambling around the pocket as the Los Angeles Chargers' pass rush was barreling through his offensive line, looking for a receiver to give him a chance to extend the drive.  Mahomes could have looked to Travis Kelce, DeAndre Hopkins or other veteran options if he wished. However, knowing where Worthy was going to be, he released the ball just as he turned around to look at his quarterback. Worthy ran back to the ball, secured it and kept the team's chances of winning alive.  Job well done, even if there was some pain involved.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play. I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video,"" Worthy said. ""But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  The stacked wins have resulted in what every rookie wants: playoff football.  Worthy gets that as the Chiefs secured the AFC West title for the ninth straight season after beating the Chargers, and the rookie is excited to continue developing that relationship with Mahomes to hopefully help their case for a third straight Super Bowl victory.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  That is exactly what happened with this year's DICK’S Holiday Shopping Sprint, where two lucky winners – Tanisha and her 8-year-old son, AJ, as well as Molly from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City – curated a $2,500 holiday wish list that Worthy collected with his record-breaking speed and brought to them personally.  ""It was fun,"" he said of the experience. ""It was always something I wanted to do just to give back to the community where I’m at, and it was just fun to see the reactions on the kids’ faces. It brightened my day."""

The lawsuit accused Jay-Z and Diddy of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000, Fox News Digital previously confirmed. Before Jay-Z was named, the rapper received a demand letter likely in an attempt to settle.  ""Things have escalated,"" Orange County criminal defense lawyer Lauren Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital, as the back-and-forth between Jay-Z's legal team and Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee now plays out in the public eye.  JAY-Z'S ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT: CAN RAP MOGUL FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES?  Fox News Digital looks back at the timeline leading to Jay-Z being named in the bombshell lawsuit:  Diddy accused of raping 13-year-old girl  Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was first accused of raping a 13-year-old while celebrities watched in October. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York on Oct. 20 by Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee on behalf of a Jane Doe.  The unidentified woman ended up at a VMAs afterparty after attempting to gain entry to the awards show at Radio City Music Hall, according to court documents.  ""One of the limousine drivers she spoke to claimed to work for [Diddy],"" the lawsuit read. ""He told her that Combs liked younger girls and said she ‘fit what Diddy was looking for,’ not allowing her into the Awards, but inviting her to an afterparty.""  The girl claimed after being given one drink, she found a room to lie down in because she became ""woozy and lightheaded."" At one point, Combs and two unidentified celebrities entered the room. ""Celebrity A"" allegedly raped the 13-year-old while Combs and ""Celebrity B"" watched. Afterwards, the young girl claimed Combs raped her while ""Celebrity A"" and ""Celebrity B"" watched.  Diddy denied the allegations in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.  WATCH ON FOX NATION: WHAT DIDDY DO?  Jay-Z receives a demand letter regarding the sexual assault lawsuit against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs  At some point, Jay-Z received a demand letter from the anonymous accuser's lawyer – unbeknownst to the public. Jay-Z confirmed this information in his statement denying the rape accusation.  ""My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a ‘lawyer’ named Tony Buzbee ,"" Jay-Z shared in the statement on Roc Nation's social media. ""What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.  ""No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!""  ""Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes."" — Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot  The decision to eventually publicly name Jay-Z was likely due to ""a failure to settle the case,"" a legal expert told Fox News Digital.  ""Jay-Z may have decided that settling the case would suggest to the public that he was somehow involved in the sexual assault of a minor,"" Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot, explained. ""After receiving a demand letter, Jay-Z and his legal team probably pushed back against the Plaintiff's accusations and may have tried to convince her counsel to not proceed with naming him as a Defendant.  ""The Plaintiff's attorney probably made a decision to proceed against Jay-Z after it became apparent that they would not settle the case. Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes.""  Jay-Z files lawsuit claiming extortion under ‘John Doe’  Before Jay-Z was named publicly in the lawsuit accusing him and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of rape, he sued his accuser's lawyer as a celebrity John Doe.  WATCH: JAY-Z ISSUES SCATHING DENIAL TO ALLEGATIONS HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL  On Nov. 18, his lawyers filed a lawsuit against Buzbee. Since then, Jay-Z confirmed he was the plaintiff in the anonymous lawsuit.  ""Plaintiff presently faces a gun to his head,"" the court document, obtained by Fox News Digital, read. Jay-Z's team claimed Buzbee and the anonymous accuser had demanded the rapper ""either repeatedly pay an exorbitant sum of money to stop Defendants from the wide publication of wildly false allegations of sexual assault that would subject [Jay-Z] to opprobrium and irreparably harm [Jay-Z's] reputation, family, career and livelihood, or else face the threat of an untold number of civil suits and financial and personal ruin.""  While Jay-Z accused Buzbee of extortion, legal experts claimed demand letters are typical in these types of cases.  ""It is standard for these types of letters to be sent before filing a case or including a defendant in a case,"" Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital. ""If a case can settle outside of court, that usually benefits everyone involved. It is not extortion, but it can feel like it to the defendant, especially if the ask is high.""  DeGroot added: ""The tone of these letters may vary. Given the high profile nature of Jay-Z, and having a sense that it would be leaked to the press, Mr. Buzbee is starting his litigation spin as early as possible to get the attention of Jay-Z and to influence potential jurors.""  LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  Jay-Z named in sexual assault lawsuit against Diddy  Jay-Z was added to Jane Doe's lawsuit against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs on Dec. 8. The amended complaint, also filed by Tony Buzbee, named the rap mogul as ""Celebrity A.""  In the new version of the lawsuit, the 13-year-old became disoriented and found a bedroom to rest in after allegedly consuming one drink. Jay-Z, Diddy and female ""Celebrity B"" seemingly followed the girl into the room. She ""immediately recognized all three celebrities,"" according to the court document.  Jay-Z allegedly raped the girl, followed by Diddy's alleged rape of the plaintiff, all while ""celebrity B"" watched, the court document stated.  The ""Empire State of Mind"" rapper denied the allegations in a statement shared on Roc Nation's social media.  ""These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!! Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree? These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case,"" he wrote, in part.  ""Celebrity B"" remains unnamed, but will likely be revealed at some point in the process, according to a legal expert.  ""Since that person's participation appears to be that of a witness, her status is entirely different, unless there is a legal reason,"" DeGroot told Fox News Digital. ""It certainly appears that the celebrity would not want to be tarred with the same brush as Jay-Z and P. Diddy. Unless there is a protective order, her identity will in all likelihood be revealed during the discovery process.""  ""Celebrity B"" is ""undoubtedly"" in communication with Buzbee through a lawyer, Johnson-Norris noted. ""She will want to cooperate in the case and distinguish herself from Diddy and Jay-Z since she was a witness and not a perpetrator. Based on all we know so far, it is also possible she too was a victim.""

Additionally, the rapper's lawyer asked that the woman's request to proceed anonymously be denied.  Jay-Z's lawyers insisted the lawsuit was part of an ""extortionate campaign"" designed ""to force payment of an exorbitant sum of money – [Jay-Z] would have to pay X millions of dollars irrespective of the truth, or else … ""  ""When [Jay-Z] refused to pay and instead took measures to establish his innocence, this unnamed Plaintiff and her self-promoting counsel (whose name has been splashed across headlines and press conferences under auspices of representing her) went to extraordinary lengths to shut down fair defense.

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bill-belichick-said-he-always-wanted-coach-college-after-taking-unc-job-dream-come-true,Fox News,right,Trending,Bill Belichick said he always wanted to coach in college after taking UNC job: 'Dream come true',"From rumors, to a finalized deal, to a press conference, the last 24 hours for the North Carolina Tar Heels have been a whirlwind as legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick will now lead a college football program for the first time in his illustrious career.  Belichick sat in front of the media during his introductory press conference as the new head coach for the Tar Heels – an idea no college football fan would've fathomed until rumors began to swirl last week about his interest in running the program.  It was always thought that Belichick, who is 27 wins away from becoming the head coach with the most victories in NFL history, would return to the pros if he wished to continue coaching.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  But the 72-year-old explained on Thursday afternoon why he chose to go the college route.  ""​​I’ve always wanted to coach in college football,"" Belichick said. ""It just never really worked out. Had some good years in the NFL, so that was OK. But this is really a dream come true.""  BILL BELICHICK AGREES TO BECOME UNC'S NEXT HEAD FOOTBALL COACH  Belichick is obviously being modest by saying his time in the NFL was just ""good.""  Before the Kansas City Chiefs, he developed the New England Patriots into a dynasty, winning six Super Bowls and racking up wins that brought about the argument of greatest NFL head coach of all time.  College football, though, is a completely different beast, especially in this new NIL world. But these aren't waters Belichick just wants to dip his toes in – he's diving straight in and not looking to get out.  ""I didn't come here to leave,"" he said, dispelling thoughts for now that he's just trying to coach again before that next NFL opportunity opens up.  Belichick did say that, while the process may be different, the pros and college do have ""a lot of parallels."" It's why Michael Lombardi is coming in as the team's general manager, someone who knows how Belichick functions given their time together in New England.  ""I think that's the reason for the general structure with Michael as the general manager and myself as the coach and working collaboratively as we have done in a professional structure,"" Belichick explained.  For this big leap to be successful, Belichick knows he just needs to take things one day at a time. That starts with putting together his coaching staff, which he has already touched on with Freddie Kitchens coming aboard. More announcements should be made in the coming weeks.  Recruiting, not drafting, will also be interesting to watch with Belichick, but reports have indicated his wish for UNC to have the proper NIL resources to land top talent to make the program competitive.  As someone who was around the program as a kid – his father, Steve Belichick, coached with the Tar Heels in the 1950s – he understands what it means to be successful in Chapel Hill.

How could he not be happy when he is 12-1 to start off his first season in the NFL. Not many rookies get that luxury.

For the last 15 games that have been determined by one score, the Chiefs have come out victorious. Yes, the goal post was involved this past week as Matthew Wright doinked it off the left side, but it went through to beat the Los Angeles Chargers. Additionally, there have been some controversial calls that have gone the Chiefs' way in the end.  Being the villain, though, is not something the Chiefs care about. They embrace it, and Worthy is just getting a taste of what Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and other veterans on the team have been feeling since last season.  ""It fuels us,"" Worthy explained. ""A lot of people say it’s hate, like, ‘Oh, people are always going against us.’ But how we look at it, the world’s watching us. You have all these eyes – you make the best of the opportunity with all these eyes on you.""  Worthy is no stranger to having a target on his back after playing for a large college program like the Texas Longhorns.  CHIEFS ARE KINGS OF CLOSING OUT GAMES, AND WHAT ELSE WE LEARNED IN WEEK 14  However, he touched on the senior leadership that helps guide the pact, especially Mahomes, who he continues to build a rapport with each week.  The proof is in the game tape, as Mahomes, scrambling on fourth-and-6 to continue the team's game-winning drive, threw a pass to Worthy with the game on the line, and he came back to the ball, secured it and kept the drive alive.  He even injured himself on the play, but his quarterback trusted him with the game on the line. A little pain is worth it in that case.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play,"" he said. ""I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video. But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  With four games remaining and the AFC West title locked up for the ninth straight season, Worthy knows he will also be a rookie that enjoys playoff football at the end of the regular season.  He is also well aware that the target will be even larger with the Chiefs looking to become the first team ever to win three straight Super Bowls.  If Kansas City has to be the villain to do so, then that is perfectly fine for Worthy, who is solely focused on being the team's hero when it is his turn to make a play.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.  That is exactly what happened with this year's DICK’S Holiday Shopping Sprint, where two lucky winners – Tanisha and her 8-year-old son, AJ, as well as Molly from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City – curated a $2,500 holiday wish list that Worthy collected with his record-breaking speed and brought to them personally.  ""It was fun,"" he said of the experience. ""It was always something I wanted to do just to give back to the community where I’m at, and it was just fun to see the reactions on the kids’ faces. It brightened my day.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Worth took pictures, had some catches and enjoyed the opportunity to make these kids and their families smile.  ""Surprising our athletes with gifts off their list was such a delight,"" said Melissa Christian, vice president of global brand and category marketing at DICK’S Sporting Goods. ""This was another way we could meet our athletes where they are – literally! – and to do to it in record time by having Xavier Worthy, who is known for his speed, shop and deliver to doorsteps was even more fun. He was the perfect partner for this year’s Holiday Shopping Sprint.""  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."

Shawn Carter, known professionally as Jay-Z, and his legal team filed a letter Monday requesting the woman accusing the rapper of raping her when she was 13 years old be identified, Fox News Digital previously confirmed. The woman's lawyer responded, claiming the letter was used as a pretext to submit ""press releases"" disguised as legal filings.  ""It appears defendant Carter made that separate filing, which we believe to be procedurally improper and substantively deficient, to serve as the pretext for defense counsel to submit two ‘letter briefs’ to the Court on December 9 and 10,"" Buzbee wrote in a letter filed Dec. 10, which was obtained by Fox News Digital.  ""These ‘letter briefs’ are, frankly, nothing short of defamation hiding behind the thinnest veneer of litigation privilege.  JAY-Z'S ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT: CAN RAP MOGUL FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES?  ""Except for one sentence requesting an expedited hearing, the ‘letter briefs’ have absolutely nothing to do with the only pending issue before the Court — namely, whether my client should be allowed to continue to proceed anonymously,"" he added.  ""The letters’ otherwise irrelevant contentions that the amended complaint’s allegations are ‘inflammatory’ and ‘frivolous,’ as against counsel’s plea that ‘Mr. Carter is entirely innocent,’ are merely press releases dressed as legal filings.""  Jay-Z was named as a defendant in an amended complaint accusing the rapper, along with friend Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, of raping a young girl at a VMAs afterparty in 2000, Fox News Digital confirmed. The lawsuit, initially filed in October, was refiled Sunday in New York by an anonymous accuser.  The ""Empire State of Mind"" rapper denied the allegations in a statement shared on a Roc Nation social media account.  ""My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a ‘lawyer’ named Tony Buzbee ,"" Jay-Z shared in the statement. ""What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.  ""No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!  ""These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!!

In an attempt to gain entry to the venue, she began approaching limousine drivers waiting outside the celebrity-filled event.  ""One of the limousine drivers she spoke to claimed to work for [Diddy],"" the lawsuit states. ""He told her that Combs liked younger girls and said she ‘fit what Diddy was looking for,’ not allowing her into the Awards, but inviting her to an afterparty.""  The 13-year-old ""recognized many celebrities"" upon arrival at the party and was required to sign a nondisclosure agreement. However, she was not given a copy.

Jay-Z allegedly raped the girl, followed by Diddy's alleged rape of the plaintiff, all while ""celebrity B"" watched, the court document stated.  Jay-Z's legal team filed to have the lawsuit dismissed Dec. 9, one day after the amended complaint was filed.  In a statement provided to Fox News Digital, Diddy's reps once again denied the allegations.  ""This amended complaint and the recent extortion lawsuit against Mr. Buzbee exposes his barrage of lawsuits against Mr. Combs for what they are: shameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs,"" the statement said.

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bill-belichick-unc-head-football-coach,Fox News,right,Trending,Bill Belichick agrees to become UNC's next head football coach,"Look out Chapel Hill, Bill Belichick is coming.  Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels finalized a deal for the 72-year-old to become their next head football coach, the university officially announced on Wednesday night.  ""I am excited for the opportunity at UNC-Chapel Hill. I grew up around college football with my Dad and treasured those times,"" Belichick wrote in a statement. ""I have always wanted to coach in college and now I look forward to building the football program in Chapel Hill.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  OutKick's Trey Wallace reports that UNC will give Belichick a five-year deal worth upwards of $50 million.  The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach remained interested in returning to the sidelines at some point in the future, but it was always expected that he would make his way back to the NFL after missing out on a new gig following his departure from the New England Patriots before this season. After all, Belichick had been in the league in some role since 1975 prior to this season.  But earlier this week, The Guardian US reported that Belichick agreed to become the new head coach in Chapel Hill, adding that Belichick handed the school a 400 page ""organizational bible"" with structure, payment plans, staffing choices etc.  Wallace reports one of the biggest components to the deal was Belichick having enough NIL money to compete in the recruiting space, which was agreed to. He also wanted to pick his assistant coaches, and UNC is giving them the resources to get who he wants, even if buyouts are necessary.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Among those assistants expected to join the staff is Stephen Belichick, his son who serves as Washington's defensive coordinator. It was reported that the elder Belichick had the unusual request of wanting his son to become his successor, stepping in when he decides to leave the program.  This will mark Belichick's first stint as a college football coach. His father, Steve Belichick, was a longtime assistant coach at Navy. But he did have a stint in the 1950s with the Tar Heels.  Belichick has spent much of the ongoing NFL season in the media spotlight after his interviews for NFL jobs didn't lead to a job offer.  While he interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons in January, the franchise opted against extending an offer. Belichick did not appear to draw much interest from any other NFL team, but his regular appearances on ESPN's ""ManningCast"" and the CW's ""Inside the NFL"" have kept him close to football.  During an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" earlier this week, Belichick confirmed he had talks with UNC about their head coaching vacancy, adding that he spent the 11 months since his departure from the Patriots taking a ""longer look"" at college football throughout the season as opposed to during the spring lead-up to the draft as a pro coach.  ""So it’s been, it’s been a good year for me. I’ve learned a lot,"" Belichick said. ""So, I’ve had the opportunity to talk to Chancellor [Lee] Roberts, and we’ve had a couple of good conversations. So we’ll see how it goes.""  Belichick opted not to go into more detail when asked by McAfee. Instead, Belichick offered a quip about his reputation for giving terse responses during news conferences with the Patriots.  ""Yeah, let’s just leave it at that, Pat,"" Belichick said with a grin. ""I mean, I don’t want to give out too much information. I want to get my press conference aura back.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Belichick shared some details about the makeup of a college program if he were a head coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" he said. ""It would be a professional program — training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history. He finished the 2023 season with 333 career wins — which places him in second on the all-time coaches wins list. Don Shula's 347 wins still leads all coaches."
https://www.foxnews.com/sports/unc-on-board-have-bill-belichick-become-next-head-coach-still-working-out-issues-deal-report,Fox News,right,Trending,"UNC 'on board' to have Bill Belichick become next head coach, still working out issues with deal","Bill Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels are working to close a deal to make him their next head football coach, which would be his first-ever time coaching in college.  However, ESPN reported that ""there are still issues that both sides need to work through.""  The report adds that the ""ball is in Belichick’s court"" as UNC officials are indeed on board with him taking over the program. And there is expected to be a ""resolution"" soon.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  In fact, OutKick's Trey Wallace reports it's come down to just NIL money, which was among the issues that needed to be worked out in the negotiations. If that can be agreed to, an emergency trustee meeting would be called to finalize the deal.  What exactly are the other issues? Well, the potential role of Belichick’s son, Washington Huskies defensive coordinator Stephen Belichick, is one of them.  It was reported by The Guardian that, among the elder Belichick’s stipulations, his son would be named his heir to the head coach role once the 72-year-old moves on, whenever that would be.  ESPN added Belichick’s salary for taking over and more need to be ironed out before a deal can be agreed to.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  It came as a shock when Belichick’s name was floated for the Tar Heels' vacant position after longtime head coach Mack Brown said he wouldn’t return after this season.  Some of Belichick’s ex-pupils, like Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, had some fun on FOX NFL Sunday this past week mimicking their old coach trying to deal with recruiting in this NIL age of college sports.  ""There’s a lot of things he can do, and obviously he’s tremendous, and even showing his personality. But getting out there on the recruiting trail and dealing with all these college kids,"" Brady said on the NFL pregame show. ""’Listen, do you really want to come here?’"" Brady said, acting as Belichick. ""’I mean, we don’t really want you anyway, but I guess you could come, we’ll figure out if you play.’""  But this wasn’t just a publicity stunt. There’s more than just mutual interest in Belichick’s return to coaching in Chapel Hill.  ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Belichick and UNC officials spent five hours discussing a potential deal on Sunday, and in typical Belichick fashion, he wouldn’t divulge any details during his weekly spot on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Monday morning.  He admitted having a ""couple of good conversations"" with Lee Roberts, UNC’s chancellor, and added, ""We’ll see how that goes.""  If a deal goes through, it would be one of the most polarizing head coach hires for a college program in history, as Belichick has only ever been a head coach in the NFL, where he won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots.  FORMER NFL COACH BRUCE ARIANS OFFERS ADVICE TO BILL BELICHICK AS NORTH CAROLINA FOOTBALL COACHING RUMORS SWIRL  His time with the franchise came to an end before this 2024 season. They mutually parted ways and Belichick’s attempts at finding another role elsewhere were all for naught. He has since joined the sports media space, offering his insight to various outlets, including ESPN, but being open to another opportunity in football was always in the cards.  However, it was always expected that such an opportunity would come from the NFL, and there are several head coaching roles already open in the league, making this situation even more surprising.  But Belichick told McAfee and his crew what would happen if he were to become a college football coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" Belichick said. ""It would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Simply put, Belichick would bring to college football the system he knows works in the NFL, aiming for good players to join his team who will one day turn pro with the tools necessary for easy acclimation.  Time will tell if that program will be at UNC, but it appears some boxes need to be checked before a groundbreaking deal crosses the finish line.

The Boston Red Sox have landed Crochet in a blockbuster trade with the Chicago White Sox.  Boston is sending prospect catcher Kyle Teel, outfielder Braden Montgomery, infielder Chase Meidroth and right-handed pitcher Wikelman Gonzalez to the White Sox in exchange for Crochet.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  The New York Mets, who already landed Juan Soto on a record-breaking $765 million deal, were reportedly also in the running for Crochet's services next season. The Red Sox, a team with a deep farm system, unloaded four top-15 prospects to get the deal done, per MLB Pipeline.  What the Red Sox get in return is a budding star in their rotation, which needed a stud from the left side. Crochet is also under cheap team control for two years before becoming a free agent in 2027.  YANKEES SIGN ACE PITCHER TO HISTORIC CONTRACT AFTER LOSING JUAN SOTO SWEEPSTAKES: REPORTS  The White Sox made all the wrong MLB history last season with the worst record ever in a single year, but Crochet was a lone bright spot on the roster.  In his first All-Star season, Crochet pitched to a 3.58 ERA over 146 innings with 209 strikeouts and 33 walks.  His swing-and-miss stuff is what the Red Sox hope can be delivered at Fenway Park and beyond this season as a top-line rotation piece.  After the New York Yankees landed Max Fried, another reported Red Sox target in free agency, on an eight-year deal, Boston GM Craig Breslow quickly pivoted to Crochet to make sure they got a key piece for 2025 and beyond.  The Red Sox are not expected to be done, however. They were in on the Soto sweepstakes while also checking in on other position players as they hope to build a team worthy of reaching the postseason.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As for the White Sox, their rebuild continues, and top prospects like the ones they got in this deal are what’s needed to make that work in the long run.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkey-seeks-seeks-purge-pro-us-kurdish-force-helped-defeat-islamic-state-syria,Fox News,right,Trending,Turkey seeks to purge pro-US Kurdish force that helped defeat Islamic State in Syria,"JERUSALEM — Just hours after meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and discussing the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, Turkey's foreign minister sent a shocking message to Washington by saying his country's goal is to eliminate the main fighting force of the Syrian Kurds, which defeated ISIS in tandem with the U.S..  According to Turkish media, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said in a live broadcast on NTV that ""the elimination of YPG is [Turkey's] strategic goal."" He also noted the country's Kurds must be protected.  Asked about Fidan's comments, the State Department referred Fox News Digital to comments made earlier on Friday after Blinken's meeting with Fidan in Turkey.  The statement said, in part, ""Secretary Blinken emphasized the importance of U.S.-Turkish cooperation in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS mission in Syria.""  SYRIAN DICTATOR BASHAR ASSAD FLEES INTO EXILE AS ISLAMIST REBELS CONQUER COUNTRY  The U.S. has a long-standing military alliance with the Syrian Kurdish military organization, The People’s Defense Units (YPG), in Syria. The YPG is part of a broader organization known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and played a key role in dismantling the Islamic State in Syria.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has seized on the collapse of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s rule to gobble up territory controlled by the pro-American Syrian Kurds, risking hard-won gains against the Islamist State terrorist movement.  Erdoğan's campaign to purge the SDF in northern Syria has created a dangerous security situation in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS), according to Gen. Mazloum Abdi, the SDF’s commander in chief.  In an exclusive interview Thursday, Mazloum told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin, ""We are still under constant attack from the Turkish military and the Turkish-supported opposition, which is called SNA. Eighty drone attacks a day we have from the Turkish military. There is intensive artillery shells. This situation has paralyzed our counterterror operation.""  Islamic State prisoners held in SDF-run detention camps could escape amid the military offensive launched by pro-Turkish forces against the SDF. The SDF has redirected much of its force capability and resources to blunt an aggressive Turkish-backed military offensive.  In 2022, Fox News Digital reported that Erdoğan’s slated invasion of northern Syria could open the floodgates for the release of as many 10,000 Islamic State fighters.  The U.S. on Wednesday brokered a cease-fire between the pro-Turkey Syrian National Army (SNA), the Syrian opposition (TSO) and the SDF.  FALL OF SYRIA'S BASHAR ASSAD IS STRATEGIC BLOW TO IRAN AND RUSSIA, EXPERTS SAY  The U.S. has about 900 troops stationed in northeast Syria who coordinate with the SDF to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State after the new wave of Turkish attacks against the Syrian Kurds.  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., warned the Turks on X, posting, ""In the past I have drafted sanctions targeting Turkey if they engage in military operations against the Kurdish forces who helped President Trump destroy ISIS. I stand ready to do this again in a bipartisan way.  ""We should not allow the Kurdish forces — who helped us destroy ISIS on President Trump’s watch — to be threatened by Turkey or the radical Islamists who have taken over Syria.""  Fox News Digital attempted to contact various Turkish officials, including its embassy spokespeople in Washington and Tel Aviv and its United Nations mission in New York.  ""We have time and again pointed out threats against our national security, posed by the PKK/YPG terrorist network in Syria and Iraq,"" Turkish diplomats previously told Fox News Digital about the Kurdish military forces PKK and YPG. PKK is an abbreviation for the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an organization classified by the U.S. as a terrorist entity.  Efrat Aviv, a professor in the Department of General History at Bar-Ilan University in Israel and a leading expert on Turkey, told Fox News Digital, ""Turkey's actions in Syria further complicate the situation and hinder international efforts to bring about a comprehensive resolution to the conflict. The withdrawal of Turkish forces from the region and the cessation of conflicts with the Kurds could contribute to improving regional stability and efforts to end ISIS terrorism.  TURKEY'S INVASION THREATS SHOULD BE TAKEN 'VERY SERIOUSLY': CYPRUS OFFICIAL  ""Turkey's military actions in Syria jeopardize regional stability and undermine efforts to end ISIS terrorism. The Turkish strikes not only harm the Kurds, but also exacerbate the humanitarian situation in the region, causing significant population displacement.""  Uzay Bulut, a Turkish-born political analyst, told Fox News Digital, ""Erdoğan’s imperial ambition in Syria has not changed. Land grab and demographic change have always been Turkey's plan in Syria. Turkey's military campaigns against Syria have brought nothing but instability to the region and severe persecution of minorities.  ""To prevent further abuses, massacres or forced displacements against Christians, Kurds and Yazidis and to stop the spread of jihadism in the region, the Trump administration should get involved diplomatically to protect religious and ethnic minorities, particularly defenseless Christians, in Syria.""  Syria's Christian population could be as low as 2.5%, down from 10% before the civil war started in 2011. Christian and other ethnic and religious minorities face persecution from the radical Islamist Sunni terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its extremist allies.  ""The ongoing jihadist assault against Syrian Kurds and Christians is led by the al Qaeda offshoot, HTS,"" Bulut said. ""HTS forces are backed by the government of Turkey and have brutalized and displaced religious minority communities in Idlib since 2017. HTS aims to install Islamic rule in Syria.""  The Trump transition team did not respond to Fox News Digital press queries.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  When asked by Fox News Digital if the U.S. was contemplating sanctioning Turkey, a State Department spokesperson said, ""As a general matter, we do not preview sanctions.""  On his trip to the region Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met his Turkish counterpart, and the two discussed the latest developments in the area.  A readout of their meeting noted in part that Blinken ""reiterated calls for all actors in Syria to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Syrians, including members of minority groups, and to prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism."""
https://www.foxnews.com/world/south-korea-lawmakers-vote-impeach-president-over-martial-law-declaration,Fox News,right,Trending,South Korea lawmakers vote to impeach president over martial law declaration,"South Korean lawmakers on Saturday voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law declaration earlier this month.  The National Assembly passed the motion in a 204-85 vote on Saturday.  Saturday’s vote means that Yoon's presidential powers and duties have been suspended after the copies of a document on the impeachment were delivered to him and to the Constitutional Court. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will now assume the role of acting president.  The court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he's thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  NORTH KOREA CONDEMNS SOUTH KOREA AS ‘FASCIST DICTATORSHIP’ AFTER MARTIAL LAW SCARE  Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung hailed the outcome of the vote, saying the motion's passage proved the people are the country's masters and marked the beginning of a new democracy, according to Yonhap News Agency.  Saturday marked lawmakers' second attempt to impeach the South Korean president. Yoon survived an impeachment vote last weekend after most lawmakers of the ruling People Power Party boycotted the floor vote.  Since then, some PPP lawmakers announced their intentions to vote for Yoon's impeachment in a second vote, as public protests against Yoon intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  Though lasting only six hours, Yoon's Dec. 3 martial law declaration – the first of its kind in more than four decades in South Korea – has thrown the East Asian nation into political turmoil, halting diplomatic activities and rattling financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it.  SOUTH KOREA'S FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER ATTEMPTED SUICIDE AFTER HE WAS ARRESTED OVER MARTIAL LAW PROBE  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree before they withdrew after the parliament rejected it. No major violence occurred.  But in the days since, thousands of protesters have poured into the streets of the capital, Seoul, braving the bitter cold, calling for the president's ouster and arrest. Yoon's conservative supporters, meanwhile, have held counterprotests, denouncing attempts to impeach the president.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea, as law enforcement authorities are investigating whether he and others involved in the martial law declaration committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. If convicted, the leader of a rebellion plot can face the death penalty or life imprisonment.  Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution, but that doesn't extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Yoon's defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul's metropolitan police agency have been arrested over their roles in the martial law case. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations.  The Associated Press contributed to this report."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-freed-syrian-prison-assads-overthrow-taken-country-us-military,Fox News,right,Trending,American freed from Syrian prison after Assad's overthrow taken out of country by US military,"An American who was released this week after being held in a Syrian prison for seven months has been flown out of the country on a U.S. military helicopter, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Travis Timmerman, who was among thousands of prisoners freed by rebels who overthrew former President Bashar al-Assad over the weekend, said after his release that he had been on a Christian pilgrimage when he illegally crossed into the country seven months ago and was detained.  He told The Associated Press that, along with another Syrian man, the ""liberators"" freed him with around 70 women, some of whom were also being held with their children.  Timmerman said that he wasn’t treated badly while he was held in the infamous Syrian intelligence facility known as Palestine Branch.  TRUMP'S PLEDGE AGAINST ‘FOREVER WARS’ COULD BE TESTED WITH SYRIA IN HANDS OF JIHADIST FACTIONS  But he told the Al-Arabiya TV network that he could hear other men being tortured in the prison every day.  ""It was OK. I was fed. I was watered,"" said Timmerman. ""The one difficulty was that I couldn’t go to the bathroom when I wanted to. I was not beaten, and the guards treated me decently.""  He was allowed out of his cell three times a day to go to the bathroom.  After Assad’s overthrow, he said the rebels came to the prison and ""knocked the door down (of his cell) with a hammer.""  Timmerman was first seen in video that emerged online Thursday after rebels seized Damascus, the country’s capital.  SYRIA'S LIBERATED POLITICAL PRISONS REVEAL GRIM REALITY OF BASHAR ASSAD'S REGIME OF TORTURE  In the video, a bearded Timmerman was lying on a mattress under a blanket in what appeared to be a private house. A group of men in the video said he was being treated well and would be safely returned home, The Associated Press reported.  Palestine Branch, also known as Branch 235, houses nearly a dozen buildings hidden behind high concrete walls, according to The New York Times.  Human Rights Watch reported more than a decade ago that prisoners there were subjected to torture, including electrocutions and beatings.  ""The guards hung me by my wrists from the ceiling for eight days,"" a former prisoner told the organization in 2012. ""After a few days of hanging, being denied sleep, it felt like my brain stopped working. I was imagining things. My feet got swollen on the third day. I felt pain that I have never felt in my entire life. It was excruciating. I screamed that I needed to go to a hospital, but the guards just laughed at me.""  Many prisoners would also die of illnesses or starvation under the deplorable conditions.  At another notorious Syrian prison known as Sednaya, The Free Press, in collaboration with the Center for Peace Communications, also discovered testimonies of torture and executions while investigating it after the fall of Assad’s regime this week.  ""They would call out names at dawn, strip the prisoners of their clothes, and take them away,"" a former inmate told The Free Press. ""We knew from the sound of chains on the platforms that these were executions. Condemned prisoners wouldn’t be fed for three days prior. Once a month, they would search us. During one such search, an officer declared, ‘We’re not here to inspect; we’re here to kill.’""  Since the thousands of prisoners were released, loved ones have been searching for signs of those who went missing in the barbaric prisons.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/australian-jewish-community-alarmed-amid-rising-antisemitism-fear-anxiety,Fox News,right,Trending,Australia's Jewish community alarmed by rising antisemitism: 'Fear and anxiety',"A devastating arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue is now being investigated as a possible terror attack, drawing worldwide attention to a stark increase in antisemitism in Australia.  Masked vandals set the Adass Israel Synagogue aflame on Dec. 6, in one of several incidents that have left the Jewish community seeking support from government leaders.  On Wednesday, Sky News Australia reported a car was destroyed after being set on fire in a Jewish community in Sydney. At least two, but possibly as many as seven, buildings in the area were vandalized, with one graffiti tag reading ""kill Israiel"" (sic). This rash of hate followed in the wake of a similar incident late last month, when vehicles and a restaurant in the same area were covered with graffiti.  Following the attacks in Sydney, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told Sky News Australia, ""Sydney, per capita, has the second-highest number of Holocaust survivors in the world,"" explaining that they came ""to Australia specifically to be free from this kind of hate.""  JEWISH CHILDREN, TEENS VIOLENTLY ATTACKED IN LONDON: ‘STREETS ARE NO LONGER SAFE’  Worshiper Yumi Friedman told Avi Yemini of Rebel News that he was inside the synagogue when he heard banging on the door and saw glass flying. Friedman later said he smelled fire and burned his hand while attempting to open the synagogue door.  Friedman said that responding police told Jewish worshipers to get on the ground and show their hands. ""They came and arrested us,"" he said. ""It took them a while to realize that we’re Jewish and we didn’t do this.""  Zionism is not a feature of the Haredi Judaism that worshipers at the Adass Israel Synagogue practice. Yemini asked members of the community why they believed the non-Zionist synagogue was targeted. ""Jews are Jews,"" a man wearing a kippah replied. ""They’re anti-Jews,"" another visibly Jewish man told Yemini. ""Not anti-anything else.""  Yemini filmed a protester outside the firebombed synagogue wearing a keffiyeh and a baseball cap featuring the Palestinian flag who held a sign stating ""Nothing is more antisemitic than Zionism.""  Numerous community members interviewed by Yemini said they felt unsupported by the local government. ""People have been attacked here,"" one man reminded Victoria Police Detective Inspector Chris Murray, who was present to address the community. ""Why don’t you put someone in here?""  ""We’re doing our best,"" Murray responded.  Murray told crowds that police would ""do everything"" to ""bring these individuals before the courts."" Though they believed the attack was targeted, Murray said that ""what we don’t know is why.""  Shane Patton, Victoria police chief commissioner, told reporters at a press conference that the firebombing is being investigated as ""a likely terror attack.""  CALLS FOR US TO DO MORE AS ANTISEMITIC ATTACKS SKYROCKET IN EUROPE: ‘ENORMOUSLY PAINFUL’  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been lambasted for his response to the Melbourne attack, which a Sky News Australia host said was ""four days too late."" Yemini documented Albanese’s visit to the Adass Israel Synagogue. When the kippah-wearing prime minister failed to answer questions from assembled reporters, Yemini followed him to the car, telling Albanese that ""yesterday was the first time you didn’t conflate antisemitism and Islamophobia.""  Though it has faced more intolerance, the Jewish population of Australia is around one-eighth the size of the Muslim population, and has been stagnant or declining while the percentage of Muslims has grown. In 2016, Jewish Australians made up 0.5% of the population, according to Monash University. Muslims made up 2.6% of the population in 2016, according to the University of South Australia. Today, Muslims account for 3.2% of the Australian population while 0.4% of the population is Jewish.  In the aftermath of recent attacks, Albanese stated that the Australian Federal Police will be conducting an operation that would ""focus on threats, violence, and hatred"" targeting the Jewish community. Reuters reported that Albanese has allocated $25 million (approximately U.S. $15 million) since 2022 to increase security for Jewish organizations. He has also worked to minimize hate speech and banned the Nazi salute.  Many Jewish Australians believe these efforts are not enough. Earlier this month, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) sent an open letter to Albanese, which it shared with Fox News Digital. The ECAJ explained that ""the very character of this country as a free, democratic and multicultural society is in peril,"" citing the ""fear and anxiety"" experienced by Jewish Australians who question whether it is safe to display signs of their Judaism or publicly celebrate their faith and heritage.  Though the ECAJ expressed gratitude to Albanese for ""swiftly condemning"" the arson in Melbourne, they requested that he act in response to ""what is now a national antisemitism crisis."" Among their requests are an increase in security funding, support for antisemitism education in schools, enforcement of laws against harassment and intimidation, and support for higher government efforts to curtail antisemitism in universities.  COLUMBIA GROUP’S ANTISEMITIC NEWSPAPER DRAWS OUTRAGE FROM NY LAWMAKER, AS UNIVERSITY INVESTIGATES  Albanese’s office did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment about criticisms of the prime minister’s reaction to the Melbourne firebombing, his response to the ECAJ’s letter, and whether the country’s shift regarding a Palestinian state might have an impact on the state of antisemitic hate in Australia.  As it has worldwide, antisemitism has risen dramatically in Australia since Oct. 7, according to an ECAJ report from November 2024. Reporting entities counted 2,062 antisemitic incidents in Australia between Oct. 1, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 495 incidents tallied during the prior 12 months. This represents a 316% increase in expressions of anti-Jewish hate, which began as early as Oct. 8, when the ECAJ reported that Sheikh Ibrahim Daoud told an audience in western Sydney that he was ""elated,"" explaining, ""it’s a day of pride, it’s a day of victory.""  The ECAJ sent Fox News Digital a trove of photographs showing acts of hate directed against Jewish Australians. These included an incident from November 2023, when unknown individuals sprayed ""Kill Jews"" and ""Jew lives here"" on a residential unit in southeast Melbourne, and wrote ""Jew-free zone"" in a Brunswick window, as reported by the Jewish Independent.  The government responded to some major acts of antisemitism. In February, anti-Israel activists released a document featuring the ""names and other personal details"" of 600 Jewish musicians, writers, academics and artists in a WhatsApp group whose communications were also leaked.  Seven months later, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus announced a proposed sentence of up to six years in prison for those who release individuals’ private details in order to cause harm. The punishment would increase to seven years if a victim was targeted because of their race, religion or sexual orientation, among other factors.  In recognition of the rising intolerance in Australia, on Dec. 9, the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory warning Jews to ""exercise extreme caution"" if visiting the country. As Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the center’s director of global social action, explained, authorities there have failed ""to stand up against persistent demonization, harassment and violence against Jews and Jewish institutions in Australia.""

Several videos posted to social media showed the former boxing champion surrounded by a group of people while shopping at Hatton Gardens in London. The crowd, seemingly more agitated, followed Mayweather into the street.  Videos showed the angry group shouting expletives as Mayweather’s security attempted to get him into a black SUV and away from the scene.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  According to reports, it was Mayweather’s support of Israel that agitated the crowd.  A source told The Sun that someone had questioned Mayweather over his support while shopping, to which the American boxer doubled down. The source added that someone then ""took a swing"" at Mayweather.  ""Floyd took a few hits during it, but his security was trying to push people back,"" the source told the outlet.  FLOYD MAYWEATHER SHARES MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AFTER HAMAS ATTACKS: 'I STAND WITH ISRAEL'  Floyd addressed the reports with a statement posted to Instagram on Tuesday. He denied being ""touched in any way.""  ""Let me set the record straight... there's no truth to the rumors going around. I wasn't punched or touched in any way. What you're seeing is just my security doing their job to keep things under control.  ""I was in the UK for a quick 48-hour stop to do some shopping, and unfortunately, people let jealousy and negativity fuel false stories,"" he continued.

""​​Over the next year, every orphan in Israel will be visited by the Floyd Mobile and receive special birthday gifts.

Mayweather, 47, has been outspoken about his support for Israel. He has taken several trips there and in October met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .  ""It was an honor to meet with you today. Your strength and courage are unmatched, and your commitment to protecting the Jewish people and citizens of Israel is truly inspiring. Keep using your voice and never back down,"" he said in a post at the time.  ""This week in Israel has been deeply emotional for me.

""We want relations with the new regime in Syria,"" Netanyahu said in a live address. ""But if this regime allows Iran to return to establishing itself in Syria or allows the transfer of Iranian weapons or any other weapons to Hezbollah or [if it] attack[s] us, we will respond strongly. And we will exact a heavy price.  ""What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this regime.""  ISRAEL DEPLOYS PARATROOPERS TO SYRIA IN 'DEFENSE ACTIVITIES' AFTER FALL OF ASSAD  It remains unclear who exactly will take over the leadership of Syria or what that government will look like now that rebel forces control Damascus.  Overnight on Monday, Israel launched massive strikes against Syrian military targets, including two Syrian naval sites, the Al-Bayda port and the Latakia port, where 15 Syrian naval vessels were docked, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed Tuesday afternoon.  ""Manned aircraft flew hundreds of hours over Syrian airspace, conducting over 350 aerial strikes together with fighter jets,"" the IDF reported.  Israel said a ""wide range of targets were struck"" including anti-aircraft batteries, Syrian Air Force airfields and dozens of weapons depot sites in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyr that housed sophisticated weaponry like ballistic and cruise missiles, UAVs, fighter jets, attack helicopters and tanks.  Netanyahu appeared to claim the strikes were similar to actions taken by Britain during World War II when it bombed a French fleet at the Algerian port of Mers-el-Kébir to prevent the ships from falling into the hands of the Nazis.  NETANYAHU HAILS 'HISTORIC' FALL OF BASHAR ASSAD IN SYRIA, CREDITS ISRAELI ATTACKS ON HEZBOLLAH, IRAN  It is unclear if any casualties were inflicted in Israel’s overnight strikes, though the United Nations on Tuesday condemned the attacks as well as Israel’s military encroachment beyond the Golan Heights and into a demilitarized buffer zone.  ""We are continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. This needs to stop,"" U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen said, calling Israel’s developments ""troubling.""  ""This is extremely important,"" he added. ""We need to see a stop to the Israeli attacks, and we need to make sure that the conflict in the northeast stops. And we need to make sure that there are no conflicts developing between the different armed groups.""  Israel received some international criticism after it sent a military contingent this week beyond the Golan Heights, a contested area that Jerusalem seized in 1967 and which is still internationally recognized as a part of Syria, though the U.S. recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the area.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-pardon-shielded-own-actions-criminal-enterprise,Fox News,right,Trending,Biden’s three biggest lies about his family’s shady business dealings,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!  President Joe Biden lied from start to finish about his family’s influence-peddling racket. He recently issued a sweeping pardon to his son, Hunter Biden, contradicting his repeated assurances that he would not interfere. This pardon may be one of the most comprehensive in U.S. history, encompassing over a decade of corruption. While some have drawn parallels between this pardon and President Gerald Ford’s pardon of former President Richard Nixon, the comparison falls short. Ford aimed to heal a divided nation; Biden is shielding himself and his family from accountability.  Unlike the corporate media and Democrats, who sought to shield Biden until his political future was doomed, observers of the Biden crime family’s corrupt practices are unsurprised by this latest contradiction. Biden’s claim that he would not pardon Hunter Biden is part of a broader pattern of deception regarding his family’s business dealings in order to conceal his involvement.  At the start of this Congress, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee launched an investigation into Joe Biden’s involvement in his family’s business dealings. Despite stonewalling from the Biden administration, we followed the Bidens’ money trail, exposing the 20 shell companies they set up to hide the shady foreign payments they received, all with Joe Biden at the center of the family business.  DEMOCRATS FRUSTRATED BY HUNTER PARDON CONSIDER WITHHOLDING FUTURE BIDEN PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DONATIONS: REPORT  Our investigation has exposed how Joe Biden lied repeatedly about his involvement in these schemes that enriched the Bidens to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Here are some of the biggest lies that we exposed during our investigation.  1. Hunter Biden laptop as Russian disinformation  In October 2020, days before the presidential election, the Biden campaign and now Secretary of State Antony Blinken, orchestrated a misinformation campaign to discredit the contents of Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop, including evidence of Joe Biden’s involvement in his influence-peddling schemes.  These disgraced 51 former intelligence officials claimed the laptop contained all the hallmarks of Russian disinformation, and Joe Biden parroted their claim during the 2020 presidential debate. Twitter removed the New York Post’s article about the laptop, even though former Twitter executives admitted before our committee that it did not violate the platform's policies.  We now know from the testimony of IRS whistleblower, Gary Shapley, that the FBI verified the authenticity of Hunter Biden’s laptop in November 2019. Special Counsel David Weiss, who led the federal criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, also used the laptop as evidence in court.  2. ‘I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings’  Biden repeatedly claimed he never discussed his son’s business dealings. However, evidence uncovered during our investigation contradicts this assertion. Evidence obtained by our committee reveals then-Vice President Biden spoke, dined or had coffee with nearly all of Hunter Biden’s foreign business associates.  Devon Archer, a Biden family associate, confirmed during a transcribed interview that when Joe Biden was Vice President, Joe Biden variously dined with Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina, Kazakhstani oligarch Kenes Rakishev, and Burisma’s corporate secretary Vadym Pozharsky at Café Milano in Washington, D.C.  These dinners occurred as the foreign nationals or their affiliated entities were collectively paying Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, millions of dollars. Then-Vice President Joe Biden also met with Jonathan Li, a Chinese national who was Hunter Biden’s associate, and wrote a college letter of recommendation for his daughter. Even when presented with this evidence, President Biden continued to lie to the American people.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION  Rob Walker, a Biden family associate who was involved in the Biden’s dealings with Chinese and Romanian entities, confirmed during a transcribed interview that Joe Biden met with the now-missing Chairman of CEFC Ye Jianming as Hunter Biden and his associates received $3 million from a Chinese entity CEFC controlled.  Jason Galanis, another Biden family business associate, testified that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone with Yelena Baturina. Joe Biden ended the call by stating, ""Ok then, you be good to my boy."" A few days later, Baturina committed to a ""hard order"" of $10-20 million to an entity benefitting Hunter Biden.  Biden repeatedly claimed he never discussed his son’s business dealings. However, evidence uncovered during our investigation contradicts this assertion. Evidence obtained by our committee reveals then-Vice President Biden spoke, dined or had coffee with nearly all of Hunter Biden’s foreign business associates.  3. ""My son has not made money … in China""  During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden told the American people that his son did not make money in China. However, our investigation has uncovered that Hunter Biden and other Biden family members received millions from China for unknown services.  Additionally, we traced how $40,000 in Chinese money landed in Joe Biden’s personal bank account. When confronted with the fact that his family did indeed receive money from China, President Biden lied again and said it was not true that his family received money from China.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As the truth came out during our investigation, the Biden camp tried to move the goalposts from Joe ""never spoke"" with his son about his business dealings to ""the president was never in business with his son."" All these lies have been committed to hide the fact that Joe Biden was the family business. At a hearing, where former Biden family associates were under oath, they confirmed Joe Biden’s involvement in his family’s business and that he was ""the brand.""  IRS whistleblowers, Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, confirmed under oath that the Department of Justice prohibited them from following evidence that would have led to Joe Biden. Joe Biden has long prided himself on his integrity, yet his legacy will be defined by his repeated falsehoods. Joe Biden has lied for a living."

Speculation about where Assad might land has been widespread since the longtime dictator fled the country, with allies such as Iran and Russia being at the top of the list.  TRUMP URGES US TO STAY OUT OF SYRIAN CIVIL WAR, BLAMING OBAMA FOR FAILURE AS ISLAMISTS CLOSE IN ON CAPITAL  Assad was forced to flee the country after a coalition of largely radical Islamist groups led a sweeping offensive across Syria, culminating in the capture of the country's capital city and the fall of Assad's regime, which had seen his family rule Syria for over 50 years.  The offensive was the latest development in a bloody civil war that has ravaged Syria for almost 14 years, a war that also led to the rise of the Islamic State terrorist organization and yearslong interventions by countries such as the United States, Russia, Iran and Turkey.  ISLAMIST REBELS IN SYRIA CATCH ASSAD, PUTIN, IRAN REGIMES OFF GUARD GIVING US NEW MIDEAST HEADACHE  Assad has been a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had for more than a decade dedicated military resources to the defense of Assad's regime and its government forces.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/kosovo-accuses-serbia-terrorist-attack-resembling-russian-actions-ukraine,Fox News,right,Trending,Kosovo accuses Serbia of 'terrorist attack' resembling Russian actions in Ukraine,"The Kosovo government has accused Serbia of blowing up a crucial pipeline that supplies water and electricity to the ethnically Serb population in the north of Kosovo. Even more troubling, some in Kosovo claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have even had a hand in it.  ""Serbia acts as a key player in the Kremlin’s bid for chaos in the Balkans, so Putin can have leverage over Western powers who do not want the violence to escalate further,"" Ivana Stradner, research fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.  Russia has deep historical, cultural and religious connections to the Balkans, and narratives sympathetic to Russia often emanate from the Serbian Orthodox Church. Stradner says Putin exploits these religious and ethnic divisions in the Balkans, pushing the region to the brink of war. She also noted that the Serbian president also benefits from chaos in the Balkans, using it to strengthen his grip on power.  TENSIONS RISE AMID CLAIMS OF RUSSIA, SERBIA INTERFERENCE IN KOSOVO FOLLOWING RECENT BLOODSHED  ""Vucic has employed a strategy of escalating and de-escalating crises in Kosovo to portray himself as a source of stability, leveraging his position as a bargaining chip with the West,"" Stradner added.  Agim Nesho, former Albanian ambassador to the U.S. and the United Nations, told Fox News Digital that, ""Russia has openly stated that it wants the Western Balkans to be a neutral region and finds it difficult to accept that most Balkan countries are NATO members.""  He continued, ""Events in Montenegro, the assassination attempt on President Djukanović, and the rise of pro-Russian parties show that Russia is present. Russia has no support in Kosovo and Albania, which are openly pro-American due to the role of the USA in supporting the Albanian nation since the beginning of the last century.""  Some experts are cautious as accusations and information is often fluid following crises in the Balkans.  ""This latest escalation, much like the previous ones, involves serious allegations - ranging from Kosovo’s claim that the Serbian government orchestrated these events to suspicions of Russian involvement,"" Helena Ivanov, associate fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital.  Ivanov warned that previous rounds of escalation and allegations lacked concrete evidence and that many of the claims remain conjecture until a full investigation is completed.  Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti said at a news conference that the attack on critical infrastructure was similar to Russia's actions targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine. So far, there is no evidence to suggest Russia had any involvement.  Kurti placed the blame squarely on Serbia and President Vucic for plotting what Kosovo is calling a terrorist attack on the water supply canal in the northern town of Zubin Potok.  ZELENSKYY WARNS RUSSIA WANTS TO CAUSE 'EXPLOSION' IN THE BALKANS  ""All evidence reveals a continuation of Serbia's strategy of aggression, with the Vučić regime exploiting a plethora of resources, including ties with organized crime, in their effort to inflict harm and cause instability within Kosovo,"" Ilir Dugolli, Kosovo’s ambassador to the U.S., told Fox News Digital.  ""This is only the latest in the long list of acts of aggression by Serbia,"" the ambassador added.  Approximately 20 kilos of explosives were used in the massive blast in what Ambassador Dugolli called a highly sophisticated manner, further indicating the professional preparation and execution of the operation.  President Vucic adamantly denied the accusations, calling them ""baseless.""  Vucic claimed in a post on Instagram that the accusations against Serbia are intended to tarnish Serbia’s international reputation and undermine stability in the Balkans region. The president is also calling for a ""thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation"" into what he called an act of sabotage.  Serbian Foreign Minister Marko Djuric told Fox News Digital that the sabotage that took place in the north of Kosovo is a serious threat to peace and stability, and he reiterated Vucic’s demand for a thorough investigation under international supervision.  LONGTIME FOES SERBIA AND KOSOVO NEARING NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS  Djuric also repeated Vucic’s claims that the aims of the operation were to discredit Serbia.  ""We have grounds to believe that this was a hybrid attack aimed at discrediting Serbia, and that is why we continue to emphasize that it is in our immediate interest to identify the perpetrators and masterminds behind this attack,"" Djuric told Fox News Digital.  Djuric suggested that Kurti could be behind the attack, but did not back up the claim with evidence, but he also made sure to point out that Serbia was ready to offer any assistance to the investigation.  Kosovo’s Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla said that eight suspects linked to the attack were arrested and that the damage to the canal had been fixed. Svecla also said that Kosovo police raided 10 locations and confiscated uniforms, heavy weaponry and other military equipment.  Kurti and Vucic met with the European Union’s new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas in Brussels. Kallas said in a post on X that the only way to EU membership for both parties is through normalization of their relations.  Both Serbia and Kosovo are EU aspirants, and ending their feud is a core requirement for gaining membership. Failure to honor their obligations or ratcheting up tensions will have negative consequences for their EU accession processes and block any potential EU financial aid. The ongoing dispute and the recent turmoil remain major obstacles to EU membership for both.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Conflict between Serbia and Kosovo following the 1999 war is unresolved and is a roadblock to their normalization process. Kosovo was a former province of Serbia and was once integrated within the nation of Yugoslavia. NATO led a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, which comprised Serbia and Montenegro, to defend Kosovo’s ethnic Albanians against violence from Belgrade. Nearly a decade later, in 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, along with its historic patron, Russia, refuses to recognize its independence.  Tensions are especially fought in the north of Kosovo, where ethnic Serbs make up a majority of the territory and refuse to recognize Kosovo’s independence. Serbs in northern Kosovo still look to Belgrade as their capital."

Local news outlets identified the woman as 24-year-old Kamilla Beliatskaya.  Police reviewed CCTV footage that showed Beliatskaya arriving at the Laad Koh viewpoint parking lot in a red car just before 1 p.m.  She then retrieved a pink yoga mat from the trunk of the car before she walked down to the rocky area below the viewpoint by herself.  THAILAND LEGALIZES SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, ALLOWS COUPLES TO WED STARTING IN JANUARY  A little bit later, video shows Beliatskaya being swept off the rocks by a powerful wave. Horrified onlookers watched helplessly as the tragedy unfolded.  Witnesses contacted the Bo Phut Police Station at about 1:30 p.m. to report the woman had gone missing.  She was last seen struggling in the rough waters, with waves reaching heights up to nine feet, local news outlet Khaosod English reported.  THAILAND SCHOOL BUS BURSTS INTO FLAMES OUTSIDE BANGKOK, 23 FEARED DEAD, OFFICIALS SAY  Water rescue teams attempted to search the area for Beliatskaya, but operations were suspended after about 30 minutes because wave conditions continued to worsen.  Earlier in the day, Jet Ski operators removed their vehicles from the beach due to hazardous conditions.  Khaosod English reported that the incident happened near the Laad Koh viewpoint in Moo 6, Bo Phut District, Surat Thani Province in Thailand. Surat Thani is home to the popular tourist islands of Koh Samui, Koh Tao and Koh Phangan.

""While the incident location isn’t a swimming area but rather a viewpoint for scenery, the victim may have been caught off guard by the unexpected wave surge.""  At about 11 p.m. on Saturday, police received a report that staff from the Impeña Resort Hotel discovered a body on Chaweng Noi Beach. The body was determined to be that of Beliatskaya.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-zealand-scientists-suspect-specimen-worlds-rarest-whale-died-head-injuries,Fox News,right,Trending,New Zealand scientists suspect specimen of world’s rarest whale died from head injuries,"Scientists suspect the first complete specimen ever recorded of the world’s rarest whale died from head injuries, an expert said Friday.  The first dissection of a spade-toothed whale, a type of beaked whale, was completed last week after a painstaking examination at a research center near the New Zealand city of Dunedin, the local people who led the scientific team, Te Rūnanga Ōtākou, said in a statement issued by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.  WHALE CAUGHT ON CAMERA SURPRISING NEW YORK CITY RESIDENTS DURING SWIM NEAR BROOKLYN  A near-perfectly preserved 5-meter (16-foot) male was found washed up on a South Island beach in July. It was the first complete specimen ever recorded. There have only been seven known sightings and never of a living spade-toothed whale.  New Zealand conservation agency beaked whale expert Anton van Helden said the whale’s broken jaw and bruising to the head and neck led scientists to believe that head trauma may have caused its death.  ""We don’t know, but we suspect there must have been some sort of trauma, but what caused that could be anyone’s guess,"" van Helden said in a statement.  All varieties of beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers didn’t know how the spade-toothed type processed its food.  The scientific team found the specimen had nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, the statement said.  Among the more interesting finds were tiny vestigial teeth in the upper jaw.  ""These little teeth embedded in the gum tells us something about their evolutionary history. It’s remarkable to see this and it’s just another thing that we had no idea about,"" van Helden said.  ""It’s a week I’ll never forget in my life, it’s certainly a highlight and it’s the start of the storytelling around this beautiful animal,"" van Helden added.  The dissection was also notable because scientists and curators worked together with local Māori people to incorporate Indigenous knowledge and customs into each step of the process.  Following the dissection, the local iwi, or tribe, will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts retained by the iwi.  To Māori, whales are a taonga -– a precious treasure -– and the creature has been treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation.  The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand’s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile’s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/frances-macron-names-centrist-ally-bayrou-next-prime-minister,Fox News,right,Trending,France's Macron names centrist ally Bayrou as next prime minister,"French President Emmanuel Macron named centrist ally François Bayrou as prime minister, after a historic parliamentary vote ousted the previous government.  Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned last week following a no-confidence vote, leaving France without a functioning government.  Bayrou leads the centrist Democratic Movement, known as MoDem, which he founded in 2007.  French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday named centrist ally François Bayrou as prime minister, after a historic parliamentary vote ousted the previous government last week.  Bayrou, 73, a crucial partner in Macron’s centrist alliance, has been a well-known figure in French politics for decades. His political experience is seen as key in efforts to restore stability as no single party holds a majority at the National Assembly.  Macron’s office said in a statement that Bayrou ""has been charged with forming a new government.""  SOCIAL MEDIA REACTS TO TRUMP 'DOMINATING WORLD LEADERS' WITH MACRON HANDSHAKE DURING MEETING IN FRANCE  Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned last week following a no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly, leaving France without a functioning government.  Macron in an address to the nation vowed to remain in office until his term ends in 2027.  Macron’s centrist alliance does not have a majority in parliament and Bayrou's Cabinet will need to rely on moderate lawmakers from the left and the right to be able to stay in power. Some conservatives are expected to be part of the new government.  Macron’s strategy aims at preventing far-right leader Marine Le Pen from holding ""make or break"" power over the government. Le Pen helped oust Barnier by joining her National Rally party’s forces to the left to pass the no-confidence motion last week.  Bayrou's appointment is also in line with Macron’s efforts to build a non-aggression pact with the Socialists so that they commit not to vote against the government in any future confidence motion.  Bayrou leads the centrist Democratic Movement, known as MoDem, which he founded in 2007.  In 2017, he supported Macron’s first presidential bid and became a weighty partner in the French president’s centrist alliance.  At the time, he was appointed justice minister, but he quickly resigned from the government amid an investigation into the MoDem’s alleged embezzlement of European Parliament funds.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Bayrou this year was cleared in the case by a Paris court, which found eight other party officials guilty and sentenced the party to pay a fine.  Bayrou became well known to the French public when he was education minister from 1993 to 1997 in a conservative government.  He was three times a candidate for president, in 2002, 2007 and 2012."

Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani vowed to dissolve the Assad regime's remnant security forces as well as close prisons that had been used to house political dissidents.  Thousands of Syrians stormed Assad's various prison facilities across the country as his regime fell in hopes of releasing their incarcerated friends and family members. Thousands were released alive, but others were found dead and still others remain missing.  U.S. prosecutors named two Syrian officials who they say ran a torture facility at Mezzeh air force base in the Syrian capital, Damascus. The U.S. alleges that their victims included political prisoners, peaceful protesters and a 26-year-old American woman who was later believed to have been executed.  TRUMP URGES US TO STAY OUT OF SYRIAN CIVIL WAR, BLAMING OBAMA FOR FAILURE AS ISLAMISTS CLOSE IN ON CAPITAL  The U.S. indictment names Jamil Hassan, director of the Syrian air force’s intelligence branch, who prosecutors say oversaw a prison and torture center at the Mezzeh air force base in the capital, Damascus, and Abdul Salam Mahmoud, who prosecutors say ran the prison.  The most notorious of Assad's prison facilities was Saydnaya Prison, however, which lies just outside Damascus.  ISLAMIST REBELS IN SYRIA CATCH ASSAD, PUTIN, IRAN REGIMES OFF GUARD GIVING US NEW MIDEAST HEADACHE  Syrian citizens have flocked to the prison in the days since Assad's fall on Sunday, breaking open cells and scouring what images reveal to be a labyrinthine prison. While dozens were freed on Sunday, virtually no one has been found since.  ""Where is everyone? Where are everyone’s children? Where are they?"" said Ghada Assad, breaking down in tears.  Syrians are continuing to search the facility, however, searching for hidden cells as well as documents that might shed light on their family members' fates.

Tens of thousands of them are believed to have gone through Saydnaya, according to the Associated Press.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-group-looks-kidnapped-americans-syria-after-fall-assad-regime-wont-leave-stone-unturned,Fox News,right,Trending,US group looks for kidnapped Americans in Syria after fall of Assad regime: won't 'leave a stone unturned',"A U.S. nonprofit headquartered in Washington, D.C., is on the ground in Syria looking for kidnapped Americans in the aftermath of the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force (SETF), told Fox News Digital in an interview from Damascus that he and six members of his team arrived in the capital Wednesday to look for Americans kidnapped or held captive by the ousted Assad regime, most notably, American freelance journalist Austin Tice and Syrian American psychotherapist Dr. Majd Kamalmaz.  ""God willing, he's alive. God willing, we can find him and bring him home,"" Moustafa said of Tice. ""Same for Majd, same for the other Americans whose names are not public.""  Tice, who traveled to Syria as the country’s civil war was erupting, was kidnapped in 2012 while reporting in Daraya, a Damascus suburb. He was seen on a video released months after his capture wearing a black blindfold and being led away by a group of men shouting ""Allahu Akbar.""  Tice has not been seen or heard from since. The Syrian government has always denied holding Tice or other Americans.  Kamalmaz, a U.S. citizen who helped survivors of Hurricane Katrina and refugees from war-torn Syria and Kosovo recover from trauma and PTSD, was detained at a government checkpoint in Damascus while visiting a family member in February 2017.  U.S. officials presented the Kamalmaz family with classified information earlier this year, saying they believe the humanitarian died in Syria’s notorious prison system .  He likely died within a year or two of his detainment, his daughter Maryam told Fox News Digital in June, citing U.S. officials. The officials did not say how or where Dr. Kamalmaz died.  ""We will not leave a stone unturned while I'm here in Damascus, and I hope to find them,"" said Moustafa.  ASSAD ARRIVES IN MOSCOW, IS GRANTED ASYLUM BY RUSSIA  The SETF leader has several geolocations from sources and tips and has dispatched his team to specific locations in search of Tice .  ""Now that Damascus is free, we have no restrictions. We can go anywhere,"" he added.  Moustafa praised Tice for his bravery and for traveling to Syria to report on the country’s brutal civil war and cover the plight of civilians in the early years of the outbreak.  ""The very least that we can do is to look for him . And for a long time, we could only look for him through calling people, trying to find people that had been – that had come out of detention, seeing if they've seen him,"" he told Fox News Digital.  Joel Rayburn, the former U.S. special envoy for Syria, told Fox News Digital earlier this year the ousted Assad regime viewed Tice and other detainees as ""cards"" to use as leverage and to get concessions.  ""We know it's almost certain that they have them in their custody, or they've had them in their custody, or they know definitively what happened to those people, but they're absolutely not forthcoming,"" Rayburn said.  The U.S. State Department is now offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on Tice and has conveyed to the leading Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that finding the journalist remains a top priority.  ""In all of our communications with parties that we know talk to HTS, we have sent very clearly the message that, as they move through Syria liberating prisons, that our top priority is the return of Austin Tice,"" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.  A Syrian journalist who was imprisoned by the Assad regime claims he was detained in a Damascus jail in the Kafr Sousa neighborhood with Tice at the same time until as recently as 2022, according to a report from The Sunday Times.  AUSTIN TICE: FAMILY OF JOURNALIST KIDNAPPED IN SYRIA 12 YEARS AGO SAY HE'S STILL ALIVE, CITING ‘VETTED’ SOURCE  Moustafa told Fox News Digital he was aware of the article and plans to go ""straight there"" in the coming days to find out more information.

After breaking the 40-yard dash record at the NFL Scouting Combine, Xavier Worthy raised his draft stock, entering that zone of being a potential first-round pick.  All offseason, the Kansas City Chiefs were among teams looking for another playmaker to work with Patrick Mahomes on offense. With the 28th overall pick in hand, Worthy was still available, and they wasted no time adding his speed to the roster.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  While being over the moon that he was selected in the first round, Worthy quickly realized he had a two-time MVP, three-time Super Bowl champion and six-time Pro Bowl quarterback that would be throwing him the football.  One can guess how he feels about that after 13 games and a 12-1 record.  ""It’s kinda like a dream come true,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital ahead of Week 15.  CHIEFS ROOKIE XAVIER WORTHY SAYS TEAM THRIVES PLAYING IN VILLAIN ROLE: ‘EVERYBODY JUST WANTS US TO LOSE’  Worthy understood there was no time to geek out over Mahomes being his new signal caller. It was time to get to work, and he quickly realized that all the winning that comes with being a Chief is business at the end of the day.  ""You see why they win when you’re here,"" Worthy explained. ""They work hard, they go about their business the right way. They have the slogan called ‘The Formula’ – I feel like Coach Reid has hit [on] that in an interview. They really go about that every day, and I feel like it says a lot about the program.""  Of course, Worthy was not guaranteed to slot right in and get working with Mahomes immediately. First, he had to learn the playbook and then develop chemistry with his new quarterback on the practice field and in games.  Well, his first touch of his career, Worthy took an end-around flip from Mahomes to the house for a 21-yard rushing touchdown against the Baltimore Ravens.  Since then, Worthy has totaled 38 receptions on 67 targets for 448 yards with four touchdowns through the air, as well as 54 rushing yards and two touchdowns on the ground.  He feels the trust a quarterback needs in his receiver is there, leading to some pretty good first-year numbers.  ""Pat, he’s more of a guy that’s like, if you show you can go out there and do it, and he trusts you, and you earn his trust, he’s going to trust you throughout the season,"" Worthy said about Mahomes. ""I feel like I’ve earned his trust, and I feel like we’ve got something good rolling.""  A prime example of that came in the latest close-game victory for the Chiefs, which required Mahomes to orchestrate another game-winning drive.  On fourth-and-6 with the game on the line, Mahomes was scrambling around the pocket as the Los Angeles Chargers' pass rush was barreling through his offensive line, looking for a receiver to give him a chance to extend the drive.  Mahomes could have looked to Travis Kelce, DeAndre Hopkins or other veteran options if he wished. However, knowing where Worthy was going to be, he released the ball just as he turned around to look at his quarterback. Worthy ran back to the ball, secured it and kept the team's chances of winning alive.  Job well done, even if there was some pain involved.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play. I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video,"" Worthy said. ""But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  The stacked wins have resulted in what every rookie wants: playoff football.  Worthy gets that as the Chiefs secured the AFC West title for the ninth straight season after beating the Chargers, and the rookie is excited to continue developing that relationship with Mahomes to hopefully help their case for a third straight Super Bowl victory.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.

""It was fun,"" he said of the experience. ""It was always something I wanted to do just to give back to the community where I’m at, and it was just fun to see the reactions on the kids’ faces. It brightened my day."""

The lawsuit accused Jay-Z and Diddy of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000, Fox News Digital previously confirmed. Before Jay-Z was named, the rapper received a demand letter likely in an attempt to settle.  ""Things have escalated,"" Orange County criminal defense lawyer Lauren Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital, as the back-and-forth between Jay-Z's legal team and Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee now plays out in the public eye.  JAY-Z'S ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT: CAN RAP MOGUL FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES?  Fox News Digital looks back at the timeline leading to Jay-Z being named in the bombshell lawsuit:  Diddy accused of raping 13-year-old girl  Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was first accused of raping a 13-year-old while celebrities watched in October. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York on Oct. 20 by Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee on behalf of a Jane Doe.  The unidentified woman ended up at a VMAs afterparty after attempting to gain entry to the awards show at Radio City Music Hall, according to court documents.  ""One of the limousine drivers she spoke to claimed to work for [Diddy],"" the lawsuit read. ""He told her that Combs liked younger girls and said she ‘fit what Diddy was looking for,’ not allowing her into the Awards, but inviting her to an afterparty.""  The girl claimed after being given one drink, she found a room to lie down in because she became ""woozy and lightheaded."" At one point, Combs and two unidentified celebrities entered the room. ""Celebrity A"" allegedly raped the 13-year-old while Combs and ""Celebrity B"" watched. Afterwards, the young girl claimed Combs raped her while ""Celebrity A"" and ""Celebrity B"" watched.  Diddy denied the allegations in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.  WATCH ON FOX NATION: WHAT DIDDY DO?  Jay-Z receives a demand letter regarding the sexual assault lawsuit against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs  At some point, Jay-Z received a demand letter from the anonymous accuser's lawyer – unbeknownst to the public. Jay-Z confirmed this information in his statement denying the rape accusation.  ""My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a ‘lawyer’ named Tony Buzbee ,"" Jay-Z shared in the statement on Roc Nation's social media. ""What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.  ""No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!""  ""Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes."" — Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot  The decision to eventually publicly name Jay-Z was likely due to ""a failure to settle the case,"" a legal expert told Fox News Digital.  ""Jay-Z may have decided that settling the case would suggest to the public that he was somehow involved in the sexual assault of a minor,"" Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot, explained. ""After receiving a demand letter, Jay-Z and his legal team probably pushed back against the Plaintiff's accusations and may have tried to convince her counsel to not proceed with naming him as a Defendant.  ""The Plaintiff's attorney probably made a decision to proceed against Jay-Z after it became apparent that they would not settle the case. Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes.""  Jay-Z files lawsuit claiming extortion under ‘John Doe’  Before Jay-Z was named publicly in the lawsuit accusing him and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of rape, he sued his accuser's lawyer as a celebrity John Doe.  WATCH: JAY-Z ISSUES SCATHING DENIAL TO ALLEGATIONS HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL  On Nov. 18, his lawyers filed a lawsuit against Buzbee. Since then, Jay-Z confirmed he was the plaintiff in the anonymous lawsuit.  ""Plaintiff presently faces a gun to his head,"" the court document, obtained by Fox News Digital, read. Jay-Z's team claimed Buzbee and the anonymous accuser had demanded the rapper ""either repeatedly pay an exorbitant sum of money to stop Defendants from the wide publication of wildly false allegations of sexual assault that would subject [Jay-Z] to opprobrium and irreparably harm [Jay-Z's] reputation, family, career and livelihood, or else face the threat of an untold number of civil suits and financial and personal ruin.""  While Jay-Z accused Buzbee of extortion, legal experts claimed demand letters are typical in these types of cases.  ""It is standard for these types of letters to be sent before filing a case or including a defendant in a case,"" Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital. ""If a case can settle outside of court, that usually benefits everyone involved. It is not extortion, but it can feel like it to the defendant, especially if the ask is high.""  DeGroot added: ""The tone of these letters may vary. Given the high profile nature of Jay-Z, and having a sense that it would be leaked to the press, Mr. Buzbee is starting his litigation spin as early as possible to get the attention of Jay-Z and to influence potential jurors.""  LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  Jay-Z named in sexual assault lawsuit against Diddy  Jay-Z was added to Jane Doe's lawsuit against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs on Dec. 8. The amended complaint, also filed by Tony Buzbee, named the rap mogul as ""Celebrity A.""  In the new version of the lawsuit, the 13-year-old became disoriented and found a bedroom to rest in after allegedly consuming one drink. Jay-Z, Diddy and female ""Celebrity B"" seemingly followed the girl into the room. She ""immediately recognized all three celebrities,"" according to the court document.  Jay-Z allegedly raped the girl, followed by Diddy's alleged rape of the plaintiff, all while ""celebrity B"" watched, the court document stated.  The ""Empire State of Mind"" rapper denied the allegations in a statement shared on Roc Nation's social media.  ""These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!! Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree? These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case,"" he wrote, in part.  ""Celebrity B"" remains unnamed, but will likely be revealed at some point in the process, according to a legal expert.  ""Since that person's participation appears to be that of a witness, her status is entirely different, unless there is a legal reason,"" DeGroot told Fox News Digital. ""It certainly appears that the celebrity would not want to be tarred with the same brush as Jay-Z and P. Diddy. Unless there is a protective order, her identity will in all likelihood be revealed during the discovery process.""  ""Celebrity B"" is ""undoubtedly"" in communication with Buzbee through a lawyer, Johnson-Norris noted.

Jay-Z's lawyers insisted the lawsuit was part of an ""extortionate campaign"" designed ""to force payment of an exorbitant sum of money – [Jay-Z] would have to pay X millions of dollars irrespective of the truth, or else … ""  ""When [Jay-Z] refused to pay and instead took measures to establish his innocence, this unnamed Plaintiff and her self-promoting counsel (whose name has been splashed across headlines and press conferences under auspices of representing her) went to extraordinary lengths to shut down fair defense.

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bill-belichick-said-he-always-wanted-coach-college-after-taking-unc-job-dream-come-true,Fox News,right,Politics,Bill Belichick said he always wanted to coach in college after taking UNC job: 'Dream come true',"From rumors, to a finalized deal, to a press conference, the last 24 hours for the North Carolina Tar Heels have been a whirlwind as legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick will now lead a college football program for the first time in his illustrious career.  Belichick sat in front of the media during his introductory press conference as the new head coach for the Tar Heels – an idea no college football fan would've fathomed until rumors began to swirl last week about his interest in running the program.  It was always thought that Belichick, who is 27 wins away from becoming the head coach with the most victories in NFL history, would return to the pros if he wished to continue coaching.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  But the 72-year-old explained on Thursday afternoon why he chose to go the college route.  ""​​I’ve always wanted to coach in college football,"" Belichick said. ""It just never really worked out. Had some good years in the NFL, so that was OK. But this is really a dream come true.""  BILL BELICHICK AGREES TO BECOME UNC'S NEXT HEAD FOOTBALL COACH  Belichick is obviously being modest by saying his time in the NFL was just ""good.""  Before the Kansas City Chiefs, he developed the New England Patriots into a dynasty, winning six Super Bowls and racking up wins that brought about the argument of greatest NFL head coach of all time.  College football, though, is a completely different beast, especially in this new NIL world. But these aren't waters Belichick just wants to dip his toes in – he's diving straight in and not looking to get out.  ""I didn't come here to leave,"" he said, dispelling thoughts for now that he's just trying to coach again before that next NFL opportunity opens up.  Belichick did say that, while the process may be different, the pros and college do have ""a lot of parallels."" It's why Michael Lombardi is coming in as the team's general manager, someone who knows how Belichick functions given their time together in New England.  ""I think that's the reason for the general structure with Michael as the general manager and myself as the coach and working collaboratively as we have done in a professional structure,"" Belichick explained.  For this big leap to be successful, Belichick knows he just needs to take things one day at a time. That starts with putting together his coaching staff, which he has already touched on with Freddie Kitchens coming aboard. More announcements should be made in the coming weeks.  Recruiting, not drafting, will also be interesting to watch with Belichick, but reports have indicated his wish for UNC to have the proper NIL resources to land top talent to make the program competitive.  As someone who was around the program as a kid – his father, Steve Belichick, coached with the Tar Heels in the 1950s – he understands what it means to be successful in Chapel Hill.

How could he not be happy when he is 12-1 to start off his first season in the NFL. Not many rookies get that luxury.  However, the first-round pick learned quickly what comes with the territory of being a team in search of three Super Bowls – playing the villain role.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Worthy, who broke the NFL Scouting Combine 40-yard dash record back in April, said he hears the outside noise, especially those wanting the Chiefs to lose each week.  ""I feel like everybody just wants us to lose,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital after highlighting the fun he had with the DICKS Holiday Shopping Sprint to impact kids in the Kansas City area for the holidays.  CHIEFS' ALTERNATE REALITY: KANSAS CITY WOULD BE 2011 IF THEIR ONE-SCORE GAME RESULTS WERE FLIPPED IN 2024  ""Every week, it’s a new excuse. First, the goal post is helping us. Then, it’s the refs helping us. I mean, we can’t get a break. But it’s cool to have that. It shows that everybody wants us to lose, we have a target on our backs, and we have to continue working each and every week.""  The Chiefs are a dynasty, and Worthy entered the fray right after they defeated the San Francisco 49ers in overtime to collect back-to-back Vince Lombardi trophies.  Just ask any other dynasty in the NFL what happens when they are on top. Fans will raise them up and ultimately want to watch them fall with a new winner crowned.  However, Worthy brings up a reason why some fans cannot stand to watch the Chiefs stack wins. They have been in so many close games this season, but they have maintained their winning streak in those one-score bouts.  For the last 15 games that have been determined by one score, the Chiefs have come out victorious. Yes, the goal post was involved this past week as Matthew Wright doinked it off the left side, but it went through to beat the Los Angeles Chargers. Additionally, there have been some controversial calls that have gone the Chiefs' way in the end.  Being the villain, though, is not something the Chiefs care about. They embrace it, and Worthy is just getting a taste of what Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and other veterans on the team have been feeling since last season.  ""It fuels us,"" Worthy explained. ""A lot of people say it’s hate, like, ‘Oh, people are always going against us.’ But how we look at it, the world’s watching us. You have all these eyes – you make the best of the opportunity with all these eyes on you.""  Worthy is no stranger to having a target on his back after playing for a large college program like the Texas Longhorns.  CHIEFS ARE KINGS OF CLOSING OUT GAMES, AND WHAT ELSE WE LEARNED IN WEEK 14  However, he touched on the senior leadership that helps guide the pact, especially Mahomes, who he continues to build a rapport with each week.  The proof is in the game tape, as Mahomes, scrambling on fourth-and-6 to continue the team's game-winning drive, threw a pass to Worthy with the game on the line, and he came back to the ball, secured it and kept the drive alive.  He even injured himself on the play, but his quarterback trusted him with the game on the line. A little pain is worth it in that case.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play,"" he said. ""I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video. But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  With four games remaining and the AFC West title locked up for the ninth straight season, Worthy knows he will also be a rookie that enjoys playoff football at the end of the regular season.  He is also well aware that the target will be even larger with the Chiefs looking to become the first team ever to win three straight Super Bowls.  If Kansas City has to be the villain to do so, then that is perfectly fine for Worthy, who is solely focused on being the team's hero when it is his turn to make a play.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.

The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach remained interested in returning to the sidelines at some point in the future, but it was always expected that he would make his way back to the NFL after missing out on a new gig following his departure from the New England Patriots before this season. After all, Belichick had been in the league in some role since 1975 prior to this season.  But earlier this week, The Guardian US reported that Belichick agreed to become the new head coach in Chapel Hill, adding that Belichick handed the school a 400 page ""organizational bible"" with structure, payment plans, staffing choices etc.  Wallace reports one of the biggest components to the deal was Belichick having enough NIL money to compete in the recruiting space, which was agreed to. He also wanted to pick his assistant coaches, and UNC is giving them the resources to get who he wants, even if buyouts are necessary.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Among those assistants expected to join the staff is Stephen Belichick, his son who serves as Washington's defensive coordinator. It was reported that the elder Belichick had the unusual request of wanting his son to become his successor, stepping in when he decides to leave the program.  This will mark Belichick's first stint as a college football coach. His father, Steve Belichick, was a longtime assistant coach at Navy. But he did have a stint in the 1950s with the Tar Heels.  Belichick has spent much of the ongoing NFL season in the media spotlight after his interviews for NFL jobs didn't lead to a job offer.  While he interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons in January, the franchise opted against extending an offer. Belichick did not appear to draw much interest from any other NFL team, but his regular appearances on ESPN's ""ManningCast"" and the CW's ""Inside the NFL"" have kept him close to football.  During an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" earlier this week, Belichick confirmed he had talks with UNC about their head coaching vacancy, adding that he spent the 11 months since his departure from the Patriots taking a ""longer look"" at college football throughout the season as opposed to during the spring lead-up to the draft as a pro coach.  ""So it’s been, it’s been a good year for me. I’ve learned a lot,"" Belichick said. ""So, I’ve had the opportunity to talk to Chancellor [Lee] Roberts, and we’ve had a couple of good conversations. So we’ll see how it goes.""  Belichick opted not to go into more detail when asked by McAfee. Instead, Belichick offered a quip about his reputation for giving terse responses during news conferences with the Patriots.  ""Yeah, let’s just leave it at that, Pat,"" Belichick said with a grin. ""I mean, I don’t want to give out too much information. I want to get my press conference aura back.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Belichick shared some details about the makeup of a college program if he were a head coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" he said. ""It would be a professional program — training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history. He finished the 2023 season with 333 career wins — which places him in second on the all-time coaches wins list. Don Shula's 347 wins still leads all coaches."
https://www.foxnews.com/sports/unc-on-board-have-bill-belichick-become-next-head-coach-still-working-out-issues-deal-report,Fox News,right,Politics,"UNC 'on board' to have Bill Belichick become next head coach, still working out issues with deal","Bill Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels are working to close a deal to make him their next head football coach, which would be his first-ever time coaching in college.  However, ESPN reported that ""there are still issues that both sides need to work through.""  The report adds that the ""ball is in Belichick’s court"" as UNC officials are indeed on board with him taking over the program. And there is expected to be a ""resolution"" soon.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  In fact, OutKick's Trey Wallace reports it's come down to just NIL money, which was among the issues that needed to be worked out in the negotiations. If that can be agreed to, an emergency trustee meeting would be called to finalize the deal.  What exactly are the other issues? Well, the potential role of Belichick’s son, Washington Huskies defensive coordinator Stephen Belichick, is one of them.  It was reported by The Guardian that, among the elder Belichick’s stipulations, his son would be named his heir to the head coach role once the 72-year-old moves on, whenever that would be.  ESPN added Belichick’s salary for taking over and more need to be ironed out before a deal can be agreed to.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  It came as a shock when Belichick’s name was floated for the Tar Heels' vacant position after longtime head coach Mack Brown said he wouldn’t return after this season.  Some of Belichick’s ex-pupils, like Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, had some fun on FOX NFL Sunday this past week mimicking their old coach trying to deal with recruiting in this NIL age of college sports.  ""There’s a lot of things he can do, and obviously he’s tremendous, and even showing his personality. But getting out there on the recruiting trail and dealing with all these college kids,"" Brady said on the NFL pregame show. ""’Listen, do you really want to come here?’"" Brady said, acting as Belichick. ""’I mean, we don’t really want you anyway, but I guess you could come, we’ll figure out if you play.’""  But this wasn’t just a publicity stunt. There’s more than just mutual interest in Belichick’s return to coaching in Chapel Hill.  ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Belichick and UNC officials spent five hours discussing a potential deal on Sunday, and in typical Belichick fashion, he wouldn’t divulge any details during his weekly spot on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Monday morning.  He admitted having a ""couple of good conversations"" with Lee Roberts, UNC’s chancellor, and added, ""We’ll see how that goes.""  If a deal goes through, it would be one of the most polarizing head coach hires for a college program in history, as Belichick has only ever been a head coach in the NFL, where he won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots.  FORMER NFL COACH BRUCE ARIANS OFFERS ADVICE TO BILL BELICHICK AS NORTH CAROLINA FOOTBALL COACHING RUMORS SWIRL  His time with the franchise came to an end before this 2024 season. They mutually parted ways and Belichick’s attempts at finding another role elsewhere were all for naught. He has since joined the sports media space, offering his insight to various outlets, including ESPN, but being open to another opportunity in football was always in the cards.  However, it was always expected that such an opportunity would come from the NFL, and there are several head coaching roles already open in the league, making this situation even more surprising.  But Belichick told McAfee and his crew what would happen if he were to become a college football coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" Belichick said. ""It would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Simply put, Belichick would bring to college football the system he knows works in the NFL, aiming for good players to join his team who will one day turn pro with the tools necessary for easy acclimation.  Time will tell if that program will be at UNC, but it appears some boxes need to be checked before a groundbreaking deal crosses the finish line.

The Boston Red Sox have landed Crochet in a blockbuster trade with the Chicago White Sox.  Boston is sending prospect catcher Kyle Teel, outfielder Braden Montgomery, infielder Chase Meidroth and right-handed pitcher Wikelman Gonzalez to the White Sox in exchange for Crochet.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  The New York Mets, who already landed Juan Soto on a record-breaking $765 million deal, were reportedly also in the running for Crochet's services next season. The Red Sox, a team with a deep farm system, unloaded four top-15 prospects to get the deal done, per MLB Pipeline.  What the Red Sox get in return is a budding star in their rotation, which needed a stud from the left side. Crochet is also under cheap team control for two years before becoming a free agent in 2027.  YANKEES SIGN ACE PITCHER TO HISTORIC CONTRACT AFTER LOSING JUAN SOTO SWEEPSTAKES: REPORTS  The White Sox made all the wrong MLB history last season with the worst record ever in a single year, but Crochet was a lone bright spot on the roster.  In his first All-Star season, Crochet pitched to a 3.58 ERA over 146 innings with 209 strikeouts and 33 walks.  His swing-and-miss stuff is what the Red Sox hope can be delivered at Fenway Park and beyond this season as a top-line rotation piece.  After the New York Yankees landed Max Fried, another reported Red Sox target in free agency, on an eight-year deal, Boston GM Craig Breslow quickly pivoted to Crochet to make sure they got a key piece for 2025 and beyond.  The Red Sox are not expected to be done, however. They were in on the Soto sweepstakes while also checking in on other position players as they hope to build a team worthy of reaching the postseason.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As for the White Sox, their rebuild continues, and top prospects like the ones they got in this deal are what’s needed to make that work in the long run.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkey-seeks-seeks-purge-pro-us-kurdish-force-helped-defeat-islamic-state-syria,Fox News,right,Politics,Turkey seeks to purge pro-US Kurdish force that helped defeat Islamic State in Syria,"JERUSALEM — Just hours after meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and discussing the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, Turkey's foreign minister sent a shocking message to Washington by saying his country's goal is to eliminate the main fighting force of the Syrian Kurds, which defeated ISIS in tandem with the U.S..  According to Turkish media, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said in a live broadcast on NTV that ""the elimination of YPG is [Turkey's] strategic goal."" He also noted the country's Kurds must be protected.  Asked about Fidan's comments, the State Department referred Fox News Digital to comments made earlier on Friday after Blinken's meeting with Fidan in Turkey.  The statement said, in part, ""Secretary Blinken emphasized the importance of U.S.-Turkish cooperation in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS mission in Syria.""  SYRIAN DICTATOR BASHAR ASSAD FLEES INTO EXILE AS ISLAMIST REBELS CONQUER COUNTRY  The U.S. has a long-standing military alliance with the Syrian Kurdish military organization, The People’s Defense Units (YPG), in Syria. The YPG is part of a broader organization known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and played a key role in dismantling the Islamic State in Syria.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has seized on the collapse of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s rule to gobble up territory controlled by the pro-American Syrian Kurds, risking hard-won gains against the Islamist State terrorist movement.  Erdoğan's campaign to purge the SDF in northern Syria has created a dangerous security situation in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS), according to Gen. Mazloum Abdi, the SDF’s commander in chief.  In an exclusive interview Thursday, Mazloum told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin, ""We are still under constant attack from the Turkish military and the Turkish-supported opposition, which is called SNA. Eighty drone attacks a day we have from the Turkish military. There is intensive artillery shells. This situation has paralyzed our counterterror operation.""  Islamic State prisoners held in SDF-run detention camps could escape amid the military offensive launched by pro-Turkish forces against the SDF. The SDF has redirected much of its force capability and resources to blunt an aggressive Turkish-backed military offensive.  In 2022, Fox News Digital reported that Erdoğan’s slated invasion of northern Syria could open the floodgates for the release of as many 10,000 Islamic State fighters.  The U.S. on Wednesday brokered a cease-fire between the pro-Turkey Syrian National Army (SNA), the Syrian opposition (TSO) and the SDF.  FALL OF SYRIA'S BASHAR ASSAD IS STRATEGIC BLOW TO IRAN AND RUSSIA, EXPERTS SAY  The U.S. has about 900 troops stationed in northeast Syria who coordinate with the SDF to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State after the new wave of Turkish attacks against the Syrian Kurds.  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., warned the Turks on X, posting, ""In the past I have drafted sanctions targeting Turkey if they engage in military operations against the Kurdish forces who helped President Trump destroy ISIS. I stand ready to do this again in a bipartisan way.  ""We should not allow the Kurdish forces — who helped us destroy ISIS on President Trump’s watch — to be threatened by Turkey or the radical Islamists who have taken over Syria.""  Fox News Digital attempted to contact various Turkish officials, including its embassy spokespeople in Washington and Tel Aviv and its United Nations mission in New York.  ""We have time and again pointed out threats against our national security, posed by the PKK/YPG terrorist network in Syria and Iraq,"" Turkish diplomats previously told Fox News Digital about the Kurdish military forces PKK and YPG. PKK is an abbreviation for the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an organization classified by the U.S. as a terrorist entity.  Efrat Aviv, a professor in the Department of General History at Bar-Ilan University in Israel and a leading expert on Turkey, told Fox News Digital, ""Turkey's actions in Syria further complicate the situation and hinder international efforts to bring about a comprehensive resolution to the conflict. The withdrawal of Turkish forces from the region and the cessation of conflicts with the Kurds could contribute to improving regional stability and efforts to end ISIS terrorism.  TURKEY'S INVASION THREATS SHOULD BE TAKEN 'VERY SERIOUSLY': CYPRUS OFFICIAL  ""Turkey's military actions in Syria jeopardize regional stability and undermine efforts to end ISIS terrorism. The Turkish strikes not only harm the Kurds, but also exacerbate the humanitarian situation in the region, causing significant population displacement.""  Uzay Bulut, a Turkish-born political analyst, told Fox News Digital, ""Erdoğan’s imperial ambition in Syria has not changed. Land grab and demographic change have always been Turkey's plan in Syria. Turkey's military campaigns against Syria have brought nothing but instability to the region and severe persecution of minorities.  ""To prevent further abuses, massacres or forced displacements against Christians, Kurds and Yazidis and to stop the spread of jihadism in the region, the Trump administration should get involved diplomatically to protect religious and ethnic minorities, particularly defenseless Christians, in Syria.""  Syria's Christian population could be as low as 2.5%, down from 10% before the civil war started in 2011. Christian and other ethnic and religious minorities face persecution from the radical Islamist Sunni terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its extremist allies.  ""The ongoing jihadist assault against Syrian Kurds and Christians is led by the al Qaeda offshoot, HTS,"" Bulut said. ""HTS forces are backed by the government of Turkey and have brutalized and displaced religious minority communities in Idlib since 2017. HTS aims to install Islamic rule in Syria.""  The Trump transition team did not respond to Fox News Digital press queries.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  When asked by Fox News Digital if the U.S. was contemplating sanctioning Turkey, a State Department spokesperson said, ""As a general matter, we do not preview sanctions.""  On his trip to the region Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met his Turkish counterpart, and the two discussed the latest developments in the area.  A readout of their meeting noted in part that Blinken ""reiterated calls for all actors in Syria to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Syrians, including members of minority groups, and to prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism."""
https://www.foxnews.com/world/south-korea-lawmakers-vote-impeach-president-over-martial-law-declaration,Fox News,right,Politics,South Korea lawmakers vote to impeach president over martial law declaration,"South Korean lawmakers on Saturday voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law declaration earlier this month.  The National Assembly passed the motion in a 204-85 vote on Saturday.  Saturday’s vote means that Yoon's presidential powers and duties have been suspended after the copies of a document on the impeachment were delivered to him and to the Constitutional Court. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will now assume the role of acting president.  The court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he's thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  NORTH KOREA CONDEMNS SOUTH KOREA AS ‘FASCIST DICTATORSHIP’ AFTER MARTIAL LAW SCARE  Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung hailed the outcome of the vote, saying the motion's passage proved the people are the country's masters and marked the beginning of a new democracy, according to Yonhap News Agency.  Saturday marked lawmakers' second attempt to impeach the South Korean president. Yoon survived an impeachment vote last weekend after most lawmakers of the ruling People Power Party boycotted the floor vote.  Since then, some PPP lawmakers announced their intentions to vote for Yoon's impeachment in a second vote, as public protests against Yoon intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  Though lasting only six hours, Yoon's Dec. 3 martial law declaration – the first of its kind in more than four decades in South Korea – has thrown the East Asian nation into political turmoil, halting diplomatic activities and rattling financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it.  SOUTH KOREA'S FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER ATTEMPTED SUICIDE AFTER HE WAS ARRESTED OVER MARTIAL LAW PROBE  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree before they withdrew after the parliament rejected it. No major violence occurred.  But in the days since, thousands of protesters have poured into the streets of the capital, Seoul, braving the bitter cold, calling for the president's ouster and arrest. Yoon's conservative supporters, meanwhile, have held counterprotests, denouncing attempts to impeach the president.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea, as law enforcement authorities are investigating whether he and others involved in the martial law declaration committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. If convicted, the leader of a rebellion plot can face the death penalty or life imprisonment.  Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution, but that doesn't extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Yoon's defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul's metropolitan police agency have been arrested over their roles in the martial law case. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations.  The Associated Press contributed to this report."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-freed-syrian-prison-assads-overthrow-taken-country-us-military,Fox News,right,Politics,American freed from Syrian prison after Assad's overthrow taken out of country by US military,"An American who was released this week after being held in a Syrian prison for seven months has been flown out of the country on a U.S. military helicopter, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Travis Timmerman, who was among thousands of prisoners freed by rebels who overthrew former President Bashar al-Assad over the weekend, said after his release that he had been on a Christian pilgrimage when he illegally crossed into the country seven months ago and was detained.  He told The Associated Press that, along with another Syrian man, the ""liberators"" freed him with around 70 women, some of whom were also being held with their children.  Timmerman said that he wasn’t treated badly while he was held in the infamous Syrian intelligence facility known as Palestine Branch.  TRUMP'S PLEDGE AGAINST ‘FOREVER WARS’ COULD BE TESTED WITH SYRIA IN HANDS OF JIHADIST FACTIONS  But he told the Al-Arabiya TV network that he could hear other men being tortured in the prison every day.  ""It was OK. I was fed. I was watered,"" said Timmerman. ""The one difficulty was that I couldn’t go to the bathroom when I wanted to. I was not beaten, and the guards treated me decently.""  He was allowed out of his cell three times a day to go to the bathroom.  After Assad’s overthrow, he said the rebels came to the prison and ""knocked the door down (of his cell) with a hammer.""  Timmerman was first seen in video that emerged online Thursday after rebels seized Damascus, the country’s capital.  SYRIA'S LIBERATED POLITICAL PRISONS REVEAL GRIM REALITY OF BASHAR ASSAD'S REGIME OF TORTURE  In the video, a bearded Timmerman was lying on a mattress under a blanket in what appeared to be a private house. A group of men in the video said he was being treated well and would be safely returned home, The Associated Press reported.  Palestine Branch, also known as Branch 235, houses nearly a dozen buildings hidden behind high concrete walls, according to The New York Times.  Human Rights Watch reported more than a decade ago that prisoners there were subjected to torture, including electrocutions and beatings.  ""The guards hung me by my wrists from the ceiling for eight days,"" a former prisoner told the organization in 2012. ""After a few days of hanging, being denied sleep, it felt like my brain stopped working. I was imagining things. My feet got swollen on the third day. I felt pain that I have never felt in my entire life. It was excruciating. I screamed that I needed to go to a hospital, but the guards just laughed at me.""

https://www.foxnews.com/world/australian-jewish-community-alarmed-amid-rising-antisemitism-fear-anxiety,Fox News,right,Politics,Australia's Jewish community alarmed by rising antisemitism: 'Fear and anxiety',"A devastating arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue is now being investigated as a possible terror attack, drawing worldwide attention to a stark increase in antisemitism in Australia.  Masked vandals set the Adass Israel Synagogue aflame on Dec. 6, in one of several incidents that have left the Jewish community seeking support from government leaders.  On Wednesday, Sky News Australia reported a car was destroyed after being set on fire in a Jewish community in Sydney. At least two, but possibly as many as seven, buildings in the area were vandalized, with one graffiti tag reading ""kill Israiel"" (sic). This rash of hate followed in the wake of a similar incident late last month, when vehicles and a restaurant in the same area were covered with graffiti.  Following the attacks in Sydney, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told Sky News Australia, ""Sydney, per capita, has the second-highest number of Holocaust survivors in the world,"" explaining that they came ""to Australia specifically to be free from this kind of hate.""  JEWISH CHILDREN, TEENS VIOLENTLY ATTACKED IN LONDON: ‘STREETS ARE NO LONGER SAFE’  Worshiper Yumi Friedman told Avi Yemini of Rebel News that he was inside the synagogue when he heard banging on the door and saw glass flying. Friedman later said he smelled fire and burned his hand while attempting to open the synagogue door.  Friedman said that responding police told Jewish worshipers to get on the ground and show their hands. ""They came and arrested us,"" he said. ""It took them a while to realize that we’re Jewish and we didn’t do this.""  Zionism is not a feature of the Haredi Judaism that worshipers at the Adass Israel Synagogue practice. Yemini asked members of the community why they believed the non-Zionist synagogue was targeted. ""Jews are Jews,"" a man wearing a kippah replied. ""They’re anti-Jews,"" another visibly Jewish man told Yemini. ""Not anti-anything else.""  Yemini filmed a protester outside the firebombed synagogue wearing a keffiyeh and a baseball cap featuring the Palestinian flag who held a sign stating ""Nothing is more antisemitic than Zionism.""  Numerous community members interviewed by Yemini said they felt unsupported by the local government. ""People have been attacked here,"" one man reminded Victoria Police Detective Inspector Chris Murray, who was present to address the community. ""Why don’t you put someone in here?""  ""We’re doing our best,"" Murray responded.  Murray told crowds that police would ""do everything"" to ""bring these individuals before the courts."" Though they believed the attack was targeted, Murray said that ""what we don’t know is why.""  Shane Patton, Victoria police chief commissioner, told reporters at a press conference that the firebombing is being investigated as ""a likely terror attack.""  CALLS FOR US TO DO MORE AS ANTISEMITIC ATTACKS SKYROCKET IN EUROPE: ‘ENORMOUSLY PAINFUL’  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been lambasted for his response to the Melbourne attack, which a Sky News Australia host said was ""four days too late."" Yemini documented Albanese’s visit to the Adass Israel Synagogue. When the kippah-wearing prime minister failed to answer questions from assembled reporters, Yemini followed him to the car, telling Albanese that ""yesterday was the first time you didn’t conflate antisemitism and Islamophobia.""  Though it has faced more intolerance, the Jewish population of Australia is around one-eighth the size of the Muslim population, and has been stagnant or declining while the percentage of Muslims has grown. In 2016, Jewish Australians made up 0.5% of the population, according to Monash University. Muslims made up 2.6% of the population in 2016, according to the University of South Australia. Today, Muslims account for 3.2% of the Australian population while 0.4% of the population is Jewish.  In the aftermath of recent attacks, Albanese stated that the Australian Federal Police will be conducting an operation that would ""focus on threats, violence, and hatred"" targeting the Jewish community. Reuters reported that Albanese has allocated $25 million (approximately U.S. $15 million) since 2022 to increase security for Jewish organizations. He has also worked to minimize hate speech and banned the Nazi salute.  Many Jewish Australians believe these efforts are not enough. Earlier this month, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) sent an open letter to Albanese, which it shared with Fox News Digital. The ECAJ explained that ""the very character of this country as a free, democratic and multicultural society is in peril,"" citing the ""fear and anxiety"" experienced by Jewish Australians who question whether it is safe to display signs of their Judaism or publicly celebrate their faith and heritage.  Though the ECAJ expressed gratitude to Albanese for ""swiftly condemning"" the arson in Melbourne, they requested that he act in response to ""what is now a national antisemitism crisis."" Among their requests are an increase in security funding, support for antisemitism education in schools, enforcement of laws against harassment and intimidation, and support for higher government efforts to curtail antisemitism in universities.  COLUMBIA GROUP’S ANTISEMITIC NEWSPAPER DRAWS OUTRAGE FROM NY LAWMAKER, AS UNIVERSITY INVESTIGATES  Albanese’s office did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment about criticisms of the prime minister’s reaction to the Melbourne firebombing, his response to the ECAJ’s letter, and whether the country’s shift regarding a Palestinian state might have an impact on the state of antisemitic hate in Australia.  As it has worldwide, antisemitism has risen dramatically in Australia since Oct. 7, according to an ECAJ report from November 2024. Reporting entities counted 2,062 antisemitic incidents in Australia between Oct. 1, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 495 incidents tallied during the prior 12 months. This represents a 316% increase in expressions of anti-Jewish hate, which began as early as Oct. 8, when the ECAJ reported that Sheikh Ibrahim Daoud told an audience in western Sydney that he was ""elated,"" explaining, ""it’s a day of pride, it’s a day of victory.""  The ECAJ sent Fox News Digital a trove of photographs showing acts of hate directed against Jewish Australians. These included an incident from November 2023, when unknown individuals sprayed ""Kill Jews"" and ""Jew lives here"" on a residential unit in southeast Melbourne, and wrote ""Jew-free zone"" in a Brunswick window, as reported by the Jewish Independent.  The government responded to some major acts of antisemitism. In February, anti-Israel activists released a document featuring the ""names and other personal details"" of 600 Jewish musicians, writers, academics and artists in a WhatsApp group whose communications were also leaked.  Seven months later, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus announced a proposed sentence of up to six years in prison for those who release individuals’ private details in order to cause harm. The punishment would increase to seven years if a victim was targeted because of their race, religion or sexual orientation, among other factors.  In recognition of the rising intolerance in Australia, on Dec. 9, the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory warning Jews to ""exercise extreme caution"" if visiting the country. As Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the center’s director of global social action, explained, authorities there have failed ""to stand up against persistent demonization, harassment and violence against Jews and Jewish institutions in Australia.""

Several videos posted to social media showed the former boxing champion surrounded by a group of people while shopping at Hatton Gardens in London. The crowd, seemingly more agitated, followed Mayweather into the street.  Videos showed the angry group shouting expletives as Mayweather’s security attempted to get him into a black SUV and away from the scene.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  According to reports, it was Mayweather’s support of Israel that agitated the crowd.  A source told The Sun that someone had questioned Mayweather over his support while shopping, to which the American boxer doubled down. The source added that someone then ""took a swing"" at Mayweather.  ""Floyd took a few hits during it, but his security was trying to push people back,"" the source told the outlet.  FLOYD MAYWEATHER SHARES MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AFTER HAMAS ATTACKS: 'I STAND WITH ISRAEL'  Floyd addressed the reports with a statement posted to Instagram on Tuesday. He denied being ""touched in any way.""  ""Let me set the record straight... there's no truth to the rumors going around. I wasn't punched or touched in any way. What you're seeing is just my security doing their job to keep things under control.  ""I was in the UK for a quick 48-hour stop to do some shopping, and unfortunately, people let jealousy and negativity fuel false stories,"" he continued. ""I'm perfectly fine, and there's really nothing more to it.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The dustup comes just days after Mayweather announced the ""Mayweather Israel Initiative,"" aimed at offering support to orphans.  ""​​Over the next year, every orphan in Israel will be visited by the Floyd Mobile and receive special birthday gifts. To all the widows and orphans: keep your heads held high as we honor the cherished memories of those who have passed,"" he wrote in a post on Instagram.  Mayweather, 47, has been outspoken about his support for Israel. He has taken several trips there and in October met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .  ""It was an honor to meet with you today. Your strength and courage are unmatched, and your commitment to protecting the Jewish people and citizens of Israel is truly inspiring. Keep using your voice and never back down,"" he said in a post at the time.  ""This week in Israel has been deeply emotional for me. Visiting injured soldiers, meeting families of fallen heroes, and connecting with the people of Israel has been a humbling experience."""
https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-wants-establish-relations-syria-says-attack-becomes-threat,Fox News,right,Politics,Netanyahu wants to establish ‘relations’ with Syria but says Israel will attack it if becomes a threat,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday he wants to establish ""relations"" with the new regime in Syria after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, but he warned Israel will not hesitate to attack the Middle Eastern nation should it pose a threat.  ""We want relations with the new regime in Syria,"" Netanyahu said in a live address. ""But if this regime allows Iran to return to establishing itself in Syria or allows the transfer of Iranian weapons or any other weapons to Hezbollah or [if it] attack[s] us, we will respond strongly. And we will exact a heavy price.  ""What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this regime.""  ISRAEL DEPLOYS PARATROOPERS TO SYRIA IN 'DEFENSE ACTIVITIES' AFTER FALL OF ASSAD  It remains unclear who exactly will take over the leadership of Syria or what that government will look like now that rebel forces control Damascus.  Overnight on Monday, Israel launched massive strikes against Syrian military targets, including two Syrian naval sites, the Al-Bayda port and the Latakia port, where 15 Syrian naval vessels were docked, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed Tuesday afternoon.  ""Manned aircraft flew hundreds of hours over Syrian airspace, conducting over 350 aerial strikes together with fighter jets,"" the IDF reported.  Israel said a ""wide range of targets were struck"" including anti-aircraft batteries, Syrian Air Force airfields and dozens of weapons depot sites in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyr that housed sophisticated weaponry like ballistic and cruise missiles, UAVs, fighter jets, attack helicopters and tanks.  Netanyahu appeared to claim the strikes were similar to actions taken by Britain during World War II when it bombed a French fleet at the Algerian port of Mers-el-Kébir to prevent the ships from falling into the hands of the Nazis.  NETANYAHU HAILS 'HISTORIC' FALL OF BASHAR ASSAD IN SYRIA, CREDITS ISRAELI ATTACKS ON HEZBOLLAH, IRAN  It is unclear if any casualties were inflicted in Israel’s overnight strikes, though the United Nations on Tuesday condemned the attacks as well as Israel’s military encroachment beyond the Golan Heights and into a demilitarized buffer zone.  ""We are continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. This needs to stop,"" U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen said, calling Israel’s developments ""troubling.""  ""This is extremely important,"" he added. ""We need to see a stop to the Israeli attacks, and we need to make sure that the conflict in the northeast stops. And we need to make sure that there are no conflicts developing between the different armed groups.""  Israel received some international criticism after it sent a military contingent this week beyond the Golan Heights, a contested area that Jerusalem seized in 1967 and which is still internationally recognized as a part of Syria, though the U.S. recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the area.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  ""We're against these types of attacks. I think this is a turning point for Syria. It should not be used by its neighbors to encroach on the territory of Syria,"" U.N. spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric reportedly said Tuesday.  In his address, Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s position and said, ""We have no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of Syria, but we clearly have the intention of doing what is necessary to ensure our security."""
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-pardon-shielded-own-actions-criminal-enterprise,Fox News,right,Politics,Biden’s three biggest lies about his family’s shady business dealings,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!  President Joe Biden lied from start to finish about his family’s influence-peddling racket. He recently issued a sweeping pardon to his son, Hunter Biden, contradicting his repeated assurances that he would not interfere. This pardon may be one of the most comprehensive in U.S. history, encompassing over a decade of corruption. While some have drawn parallels between this pardon and President Gerald Ford’s pardon of former President Richard Nixon, the comparison falls short. Ford aimed to heal a divided nation; Biden is shielding himself and his family from accountability.  Unlike the corporate media and Democrats, who sought to shield Biden until his political future was doomed, observers of the Biden crime family’s corrupt practices are unsurprised by this latest contradiction. Biden’s claim that he would not pardon Hunter Biden is part of a broader pattern of deception regarding his family’s business dealings in order to conceal his involvement.  At the start of this Congress, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee launched an investigation into Joe Biden’s involvement in his family’s business dealings. Despite stonewalling from the Biden administration, we followed the Bidens’ money trail, exposing the 20 shell companies they set up to hide the shady foreign payments they received, all with Joe Biden at the center of the family business.  DEMOCRATS FRUSTRATED BY HUNTER PARDON CONSIDER WITHHOLDING FUTURE BIDEN PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DONATIONS: REPORT  Our investigation has exposed how Joe Biden lied repeatedly about his involvement in these schemes that enriched the Bidens to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Here are some of the biggest lies that we exposed during our investigation.  1. Hunter Biden laptop as Russian disinformation  In October 2020, days before the presidential election, the Biden campaign and now Secretary of State Antony Blinken, orchestrated a misinformation campaign to discredit the contents of Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop, including evidence of Joe Biden’s involvement in his influence-peddling schemes.  These disgraced 51 former intelligence officials claimed the laptop contained all the hallmarks of Russian disinformation, and Joe Biden parroted their claim during the 2020 presidential debate. Twitter removed the New York Post’s article about the laptop, even though former Twitter executives admitted before our committee that it did not violate the platform's policies.  We now know from the testimony of IRS whistleblower, Gary Shapley, that the FBI verified the authenticity of Hunter Biden’s laptop in November 2019. Special Counsel David Weiss, who led the federal criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, also used the laptop as evidence in court.  2. ‘I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings’  Biden repeatedly claimed he never discussed his son’s business dealings. However, evidence uncovered during our investigation contradicts this assertion. Evidence obtained by our committee reveals then-Vice President Biden spoke, dined or had coffee with nearly all of Hunter Biden’s foreign business associates.  Devon Archer, a Biden family associate, confirmed during a transcribed interview that when Joe Biden was Vice President, Joe Biden variously dined with Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina, Kazakhstani oligarch Kenes Rakishev, and Burisma’s corporate secretary Vadym Pozharsky at Café Milano in Washington, D.C.  These dinners occurred as the foreign nationals or their affiliated entities were collectively paying Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, millions of dollars. Then-Vice President Joe Biden also met with Jonathan Li, a Chinese national who was Hunter Biden’s associate, and wrote a college letter of recommendation for his daughter. Even when presented with this evidence, President Biden continued to lie to the American people.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION  Rob Walker, a Biden family associate who was involved in the Biden’s dealings with Chinese and Romanian entities, confirmed during a transcribed interview that Joe Biden met with the now-missing Chairman of CEFC Ye Jianming as Hunter Biden and his associates received $3 million from a Chinese entity CEFC controlled.  Jason Galanis, another Biden family business associate, testified that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone with Yelena Baturina. Joe Biden ended the call by stating, ""Ok then, you be good to my boy."" A few days later, Baturina committed to a ""hard order"" of $10-20 million to an entity benefitting Hunter Biden.  Biden repeatedly claimed he never discussed his son’s business dealings. However, evidence uncovered during our investigation contradicts this assertion. Evidence obtained by our committee reveals then-Vice President Biden spoke, dined or had coffee with nearly all of Hunter Biden’s foreign business associates.  3. ""My son has not made money … in China""  During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden told the American people that his son did not make money in China. However, our investigation has uncovered that Hunter Biden and other Biden family members received millions from China for unknown services.  Additionally, we traced how $40,000 in Chinese money landed in Joe Biden’s personal bank account. When confronted with the fact that his family did indeed receive money from China, President Biden lied again and said it was not true that his family received money from China.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As the truth came out during our investigation, the Biden camp tried to move the goalposts from Joe ""never spoke"" with his son about his business dealings to ""the president was never in business with his son."" All these lies have been committed to hide the fact that Joe Biden was the family business. At a hearing, where former Biden family associates were under oath, they confirmed Joe Biden’s involvement in his family’s business and that he was ""the brand.""  IRS whistleblowers, Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, confirmed under oath that the Department of Justice prohibited them from following evidence that would have led to Joe Biden. Joe Biden has long prided himself on his integrity, yet his legacy will be defined by his repeated falsehoods. Joe Biden has lied for a living."
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/assad-arrives-moscow-granted-asylum-russia,Fox News,right,Politics,"Assad arrives in Moscow, is granted asylum by Russia","Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, who fled the country Saturday as rebels closed in on the capital of Damascus, has arrived in Moscow and has been granted asylum by the Russian government, according to Russian News Agency Tass.  Speculation about where Assad might land has been widespread since the longtime dictator fled the country, with allies such as Iran and Russia being at the top of the list.  TRUMP URGES US TO STAY OUT OF SYRIAN CIVIL WAR, BLAMING OBAMA FOR FAILURE AS ISLAMISTS CLOSE IN ON CAPITAL  Assad was forced to flee the country after a coalition of largely radical Islamist groups led a sweeping offensive across Syria, culminating in the capture of the country's capital city and the fall of Assad's regime, which had seen his family rule Syria for over 50 years.  The offensive was the latest development in a bloody civil war that has ravaged Syria for almost 14 years, a war that also led to the rise of the Islamic State terrorist organization and yearslong interventions by countries such as the United States, Russia, Iran and Turkey.  ISLAMIST REBELS IN SYRIA CATCH ASSAD, PUTIN, IRAN REGIMES OFF GUARD GIVING US NEW MIDEAST HEADACHE  Assad has been a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had for more than a decade dedicated military resources to the defense of Assad's regime and its government forces.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/kosovo-accuses-serbia-terrorist-attack-resembling-russian-actions-ukraine,Fox News,right,Politics,Kosovo accuses Serbia of 'terrorist attack' resembling Russian actions in Ukraine,"The Kosovo government has accused Serbia of blowing up a crucial pipeline that supplies water and electricity to the ethnically Serb population in the north of Kosovo. Even more troubling, some in Kosovo claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have even had a hand in it.  ""Serbia acts as a key player in the Kremlin’s bid for chaos in the Balkans, so Putin can have leverage over Western powers who do not want the violence to escalate further,"" Ivana Stradner, research fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.  Russia has deep historical, cultural and religious connections to the Balkans, and narratives sympathetic to Russia often emanate from the Serbian Orthodox Church. Stradner says Putin exploits these religious and ethnic divisions in the Balkans, pushing the region to the brink of war. She also noted that the Serbian president also benefits from chaos in the Balkans, using it to strengthen his grip on power.  TENSIONS RISE AMID CLAIMS OF RUSSIA, SERBIA INTERFERENCE IN KOSOVO FOLLOWING RECENT BLOODSHED  ""Vucic has employed a strategy of escalating and de-escalating crises in Kosovo to portray himself as a source of stability, leveraging his position as a bargaining chip with the West,"" Stradner added.  Agim Nesho, former Albanian ambassador to the U.S. and the United Nations, told Fox News Digital that, ""Russia has openly stated that it wants the Western Balkans to be a neutral region and finds it difficult to accept that most Balkan countries are NATO members.""  He continued, ""Events in Montenegro, the assassination attempt on President Djukanović, and the rise of pro-Russian parties show that Russia is present. Russia has no support in Kosovo and Albania, which are openly pro-American due to the role of the USA in supporting the Albanian nation since the beginning of the last century.""  Some experts are cautious as accusations and information is often fluid following crises in the Balkans.  ""This latest escalation, much like the previous ones, involves serious allegations - ranging from Kosovo’s claim that the Serbian government orchestrated these events to suspicions of Russian involvement,"" Helena Ivanov, associate fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital.  Ivanov warned that previous rounds of escalation and allegations lacked concrete evidence and that many of the claims remain conjecture until a full investigation is completed.  Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti said at a news conference that the attack on critical infrastructure was similar to Russia's actions targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine. So far, there is no evidence to suggest Russia had any involvement.  Kurti placed the blame squarely on Serbia and President Vucic for plotting what Kosovo is calling a terrorist attack on the water supply canal in the northern town of Zubin Potok.  ZELENSKYY WARNS RUSSIA WANTS TO CAUSE 'EXPLOSION' IN THE BALKANS  ""All evidence reveals a continuation of Serbia's strategy of aggression, with the Vučić regime exploiting a plethora of resources, including ties with organized crime, in their effort to inflict harm and cause instability within Kosovo,"" Ilir Dugolli, Kosovo’s ambassador to the U.S., told Fox News Digital.  ""This is only the latest in the long list of acts of aggression by Serbia,"" the ambassador added.  Approximately 20 kilos of explosives were used in the massive blast in what Ambassador Dugolli called a highly sophisticated manner, further indicating the professional preparation and execution of the operation.  President Vucic adamantly denied the accusations, calling them ""baseless.""  Vucic claimed in a post on Instagram that the accusations against Serbia are intended to tarnish Serbia’s international reputation and undermine stability in the Balkans region. The president is also calling for a ""thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation"" into what he called an act of sabotage.  Serbian Foreign Minister Marko Djuric told Fox News Digital that the sabotage that took place in the north of Kosovo is a serious threat to peace and stability, and he reiterated Vucic’s demand for a thorough investigation under international supervision.  LONGTIME FOES SERBIA AND KOSOVO NEARING NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS  Djuric also repeated Vucic’s claims that the aims of the operation were to discredit Serbia.  ""We have grounds to believe that this was a hybrid attack aimed at discrediting Serbia, and that is why we continue to emphasize that it is in our immediate interest to identify the perpetrators and masterminds behind this attack,"" Djuric told Fox News Digital.  Djuric suggested that Kurti could be behind the attack, but did not back up the claim with evidence, but he also made sure to point out that Serbia was ready to offer any assistance to the investigation.  Kosovo’s Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla said that eight suspects linked to the attack were arrested and that the damage to the canal had been fixed. Svecla also said that Kosovo police raided 10 locations and confiscated uniforms, heavy weaponry and other military equipment.  Kurti and Vucic met with the European Union’s new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas in Brussels. Kallas said in a post on X that the only way to EU membership for both parties is through normalization of their relations.  Both Serbia and Kosovo are EU aspirants, and ending their feud is a core requirement for gaining membership. Failure to honor their obligations or ratcheting up tensions will have negative consequences for their EU accession processes and block any potential EU financial aid. The ongoing dispute and the recent turmoil remain major obstacles to EU membership for both.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Conflict between Serbia and Kosovo following the 1999 war is unresolved and is a roadblock to their normalization process. Kosovo was a former province of Serbia and was once integrated within the nation of Yugoslavia. NATO led a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, which comprised Serbia and Montenegro, to defend Kosovo’s ethnic Albanians against violence from Belgrade. Nearly a decade later, in 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, along with its historic patron, Russia, refuses to recognize its independence.  Tensions are especially fought in the north of Kosovo, where ethnic Serbs make up a majority of the territory and refuse to recognize Kosovo’s independence. Serbs in northern Kosovo still look to Belgrade as their capital."

https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-zealand-scientists-suspect-specimen-worlds-rarest-whale-died-head-injuries,Fox News,right,Politics,New Zealand scientists suspect specimen of world’s rarest whale died from head injuries,"Scientists suspect the first complete specimen ever recorded of the world’s rarest whale died from head injuries, an expert said Friday.  The first dissection of a spade-toothed whale, a type of beaked whale, was completed last week after a painstaking examination at a research center near the New Zealand city of Dunedin, the local people who led the scientific team, Te Rūnanga Ōtākou, said in a statement issued by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.  WHALE CAUGHT ON CAMERA SURPRISING NEW YORK CITY RESIDENTS DURING SWIM NEAR BROOKLYN  A near-perfectly preserved 5-meter (16-foot) male was found washed up on a South Island beach in July. It was the first complete specimen ever recorded. There have only been seven known sightings and never of a living spade-toothed whale.  New Zealand conservation agency beaked whale expert Anton van Helden said the whale’s broken jaw and bruising to the head and neck led scientists to believe that head trauma may have caused its death.  ""We don’t know, but we suspect there must have been some sort of trauma, but what caused that could be anyone’s guess,"" van Helden said in a statement.  All varieties of beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers didn’t know how the spade-toothed type processed its food.  The scientific team found the specimen had nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, the statement said.  Among the more interesting finds were tiny vestigial teeth in the upper jaw.  ""These little teeth embedded in the gum tells us something about their evolutionary history. It’s remarkable to see this and it’s just another thing that we had no idea about,"" van Helden said.  ""It’s a week I’ll never forget in my life, it’s certainly a highlight and it’s the start of the storytelling around this beautiful animal,"" van Helden added.  The dissection was also notable because scientists and curators worked together with local Māori people to incorporate Indigenous knowledge and customs into each step of the process.  Following the dissection, the local iwi, or tribe, will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts retained by the iwi.  To Māori, whales are a taonga -– a precious treasure -– and the creature has been treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation.  The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand’s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile’s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/frances-macron-names-centrist-ally-bayrou-next-prime-minister,Fox News,right,Politics,France's Macron names centrist ally Bayrou as next prime minister,"French President Emmanuel Macron named centrist ally François Bayrou as prime minister, after a historic parliamentary vote ousted the previous government.  Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned last week following a no-confidence vote, leaving France without a functioning government.  Bayrou leads the centrist Democratic Movement, known as MoDem, which he founded in 2007.  French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday named centrist ally François Bayrou as prime minister, after a historic parliamentary vote ousted the previous government last week.  Bayrou, 73, a crucial partner in Macron’s centrist alliance, has been a well-known figure in French politics for decades. His political experience is seen as key in efforts to restore stability as no single party holds a majority at the National Assembly.  Macron’s office said in a statement that Bayrou ""has been charged with forming a new government.""  SOCIAL MEDIA REACTS TO TRUMP 'DOMINATING WORLD LEADERS' WITH MACRON HANDSHAKE DURING MEETING IN FRANCE  Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned last week following a no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly, leaving France without a functioning government.  Macron in an address to the nation vowed to remain in office until his term ends in 2027.  Macron’s centrist alliance does not have a majority in parliament and Bayrou's Cabinet will need to rely on moderate lawmakers from the left and the right to be able to stay in power. Some conservatives are expected to be part of the new government.  Macron’s strategy aims at preventing far-right leader Marine Le Pen from holding ""make or break"" power over the government. Le Pen helped oust Barnier by joining her National Rally party’s forces to the left to pass the no-confidence motion last week.  Bayrou's appointment is also in line with Macron’s efforts to build a non-aggression pact with the Socialists so that they commit not to vote against the government in any future confidence motion.  Bayrou leads the centrist Democratic Movement, known as MoDem, which he founded in 2007.  In 2017, he supported Macron’s first presidential bid and became a weighty partner in the French president’s centrist alliance.  At the time, he was appointed justice minister, but he quickly resigned from the government amid an investigation into the MoDem’s alleged embezzlement of European Parliament funds.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Bayrou this year was cleared in the case by a Paris court, which found eight other party officials guilty and sentenced the party to pay a fine.  Bayrou became well known to the French public when he was education minister from 1993 to 1997 in a conservative government.  He was three times a candidate for president, in 2002, 2007 and 2012."

Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani vowed to dissolve the Assad regime's remnant security forces as well as close prisons that had been used to house political dissidents.  Thousands of Syrians stormed Assad's various prison facilities across the country as his regime fell in hopes of releasing their incarcerated friends and family members. Thousands were released alive, but others were found dead and still others remain missing.  U.S. prosecutors named two Syrian officials who they say ran a torture facility at Mezzeh air force base in the Syrian capital, Damascus. The U.S. alleges that their victims included political prisoners, peaceful protesters and a 26-year-old American woman who was later believed to have been executed.  TRUMP URGES US TO STAY OUT OF SYRIAN CIVIL WAR, BLAMING OBAMA FOR FAILURE AS ISLAMISTS CLOSE IN ON CAPITAL  The U.S. indictment names Jamil Hassan, director of the Syrian air force’s intelligence branch, who prosecutors say oversaw a prison and torture center at the Mezzeh air force base in the capital, Damascus, and Abdul Salam Mahmoud, who prosecutors say ran the prison.  The most notorious of Assad's prison facilities was Saydnaya Prison, however, which lies just outside Damascus.  ISLAMIST REBELS IN SYRIA CATCH ASSAD, PUTIN, IRAN REGIMES OFF GUARD GIVING US NEW MIDEAST HEADACHE  Syrian citizens have flocked to the prison in the days since Assad's fall on Sunday, breaking open cells and scouring what images reveal to be a labyrinthine prison. While dozens were freed on Sunday, virtually no one has been found since.  ""Where is everyone? Where are everyone’s children? Where are they?"" said Ghada Assad, breaking down in tears.  Syrians are continuing to search the facility, however, searching for hidden cells as well as documents that might shed light on their family members' fates.  ASSAD ARRIVES IN MOSCOW, IS GRANTED ASYLUM BY RUSSIA  ""There is not a home, there is not a woman in Syria who didn’t lose a brother, a child or a husband,"" said Khairiya Ismail, 54, said of the prison and Assad's rule.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  An estimated 150,000 people were detained or went missing in Syria since 2011. Tens of thousands of them are believed to have gone through Saydnaya, according to the Associated Press.  Amnesty International estimated that there were between 10,000 and 20,000 people being held in the prison as of 2017. The organization also claimed that there were routine mass executions.  The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-group-looks-kidnapped-americans-syria-after-fall-assad-regime-wont-leave-stone-unturned,Fox News,right,Politics,US group looks for kidnapped Americans in Syria after fall of Assad regime: won't 'leave a stone unturned',"A U.S. nonprofit headquartered in Washington, D.C., is on the ground in Syria looking for kidnapped Americans in the aftermath of the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force (SETF), told Fox News Digital in an interview from Damascus that he and six members of his team arrived in the capital Wednesday to look for Americans kidnapped or held captive by the ousted Assad regime, most notably, American freelance journalist Austin Tice and Syrian American psychotherapist Dr. Majd Kamalmaz.  ""God willing, he's alive. God willing, we can find him and bring him home,"" Moustafa said of Tice. ""Same for Majd, same for the other Americans whose names are not public.""  Tice, who traveled to Syria as the country’s civil war was erupting, was kidnapped in 2012 while reporting in Daraya, a Damascus suburb. He was seen on a video released months after his capture wearing a black blindfold and being led away by a group of men shouting ""Allahu Akbar.""  Tice has not been seen or heard from since. The Syrian government has always denied holding Tice or other Americans.  Kamalmaz, a U.S. citizen who helped survivors of Hurricane Katrina and refugees from war-torn Syria and Kosovo recover from trauma and PTSD, was detained at a government checkpoint in Damascus while visiting a family member in February 2017.  U.S. officials presented the Kamalmaz family with classified information earlier this year, saying they believe the humanitarian died in Syria’s notorious prison system .  He likely died within a year or two of his detainment, his daughter Maryam told Fox News Digital in June, citing U.S. officials. The officials did not say how or where Dr. Kamalmaz died.  ""We will not leave a stone unturned while I'm here in Damascus, and I hope to find them,"" said Moustafa.  ASSAD ARRIVES IN MOSCOW, IS GRANTED ASYLUM BY RUSSIA  The SETF leader has several geolocations from sources and tips and has dispatched his team to specific locations in search of Tice .  ""Now that Damascus is free, we have no restrictions. We can go anywhere,"" he added.  Moustafa praised Tice for his bravery and for traveling to Syria to report on the country’s brutal civil war and cover the plight of civilians in the early years of the outbreak.  ""The very least that we can do is to look for him . And for a long time, we could only look for him through calling people, trying to find people that had been – that had come out of detention, seeing if they've seen him,"" he told Fox News Digital.  Joel Rayburn, the former U.S. special envoy for Syria, told Fox News Digital earlier this year the ousted Assad regime viewed Tice and other detainees as ""cards"" to use as leverage and to get concessions.  ""We know it's almost certain that they have them in their custody, or they've had them in their custody, or they know definitively what happened to those people, but they're absolutely not forthcoming,"" Rayburn said.  The U.S. State Department is now offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on Tice and has conveyed to the leading Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that finding the journalist remains a top priority.  ""In all of our communications with parties that we know talk to HTS, we have sent very clearly the message that, as they move through Syria liberating prisons, that our top priority is the return of Austin Tice,"" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.  A Syrian journalist who was imprisoned by the Assad regime claims he was detained in a Damascus jail in the Kafr Sousa neighborhood with Tice at the same time until as recently as 2022, according to a report from The Sunday Times.  AUSTIN TICE: FAMILY OF JOURNALIST KIDNAPPED IN SYRIA 12 YEARS AGO SAY HE'S STILL ALIVE, CITING ‘VETTED’ SOURCE  Moustafa told Fox News Digital he was aware of the article and plans to go ""straight there"" in the coming days to find out more information.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  ""It is every Syrian's job to do everything they can to get Austin back to his mother and his father, to his country, to his home,"" he said."
https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-rookie-xavier-worthy-calls-dream-come-true-having-patrick-mahomes-his-quarterback,Fox News,right,International,Chiefs rookie Xavier Worthy calls it 'dream come true' having Patrick Mahomes as his quarterback,"Every rookie entering the NFL wishes to make an immediate impact on their team, especially first-round picks who carry loads of expectation when they hear their names called by Commissioner Roger Goodell on Draft night.  After breaking the 40-yard dash record at the NFL Scouting Combine, Xavier Worthy raised his draft stock, entering that zone of being a potential first-round pick.  All offseason, the Kansas City Chiefs were among teams looking for another playmaker to work with Patrick Mahomes on offense. With the 28th overall pick in hand, Worthy was still available, and they wasted no time adding his speed to the roster.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  While being over the moon that he was selected in the first round, Worthy quickly realized he had a two-time MVP, three-time Super Bowl champion and six-time Pro Bowl quarterback that would be throwing him the football.  One can guess how he feels about that after 13 games and a 12-1 record.  ""It’s kinda like a dream come true,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital ahead of Week 15.  CHIEFS ROOKIE XAVIER WORTHY SAYS TEAM THRIVES PLAYING IN VILLAIN ROLE: ‘EVERYBODY JUST WANTS US TO LOSE’  Worthy understood there was no time to geek out over Mahomes being his new signal caller. It was time to get to work, and he quickly realized that all the winning that comes with being a Chief is business at the end of the day.  ""You see why they win when you’re here,"" Worthy explained. ""They work hard, they go about their business the right way. They have the slogan called ‘The Formula’ – I feel like Coach Reid has hit [on] that in an interview. They really go about that every day, and I feel like it says a lot about the program.""  Of course, Worthy was not guaranteed to slot right in and get working with Mahomes immediately. First, he had to learn the playbook and then develop chemistry with his new quarterback on the practice field and in games.  Well, his first touch of his career, Worthy took an end-around flip from Mahomes to the house for a 21-yard rushing touchdown against the Baltimore Ravens.  Since then, Worthy has totaled 38 receptions on 67 targets for 448 yards with four touchdowns through the air, as well as 54 rushing yards and two touchdowns on the ground.  He feels the trust a quarterback needs in his receiver is there, leading to some pretty good first-year numbers.  ""Pat, he’s more of a guy that’s like, if you show you can go out there and do it, and he trusts you, and you earn his trust, he’s going to trust you throughout the season,"" Worthy said about Mahomes. ""I feel like I’ve earned his trust, and I feel like we’ve got something good rolling.""  A prime example of that came in the latest close-game victory for the Chiefs, which required Mahomes to orchestrate another game-winning drive.  On fourth-and-6 with the game on the line, Mahomes was scrambling around the pocket as the Los Angeles Chargers' pass rush was barreling through his offensive line, looking for a receiver to give him a chance to extend the drive.  Mahomes could have looked to Travis Kelce, DeAndre Hopkins or other veteran options if he wished. However, knowing where Worthy was going to be, he released the ball just as he turned around to look at his quarterback. Worthy ran back to the ball, secured it and kept the team's chances of winning alive.  Job well done, even if there was some pain involved.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play. I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video,"" Worthy said. ""But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  The stacked wins have resulted in what every rookie wants: playoff football.  Worthy gets that as the Chiefs secured the AFC West title for the ninth straight season after beating the Chargers, and the rookie is excited to continue developing that relationship with Mahomes to hopefully help their case for a third straight Super Bowl victory.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  That is exactly what happened with this year's DICK’S Holiday Shopping Sprint, where two lucky winners – Tanisha and her 8-year-old son, AJ, as well as Molly from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City – curated a $2,500 holiday wish list that Worthy collected with his record-breaking speed and brought to them personally.  ""It was fun,"" he said of the experience. ""It was always something I wanted to do just to give back to the community where I’m at, and it was just fun to see the reactions on the kids’ faces. It brightened my day."""
https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jay-z-forced-game-chicken-ahead-bombshell-sexual-assault-lawsuit-expert,Fox News,right,International,Jay-Z forced into ‘game of chicken' ahead of bombshell sexual assault lawsuit: expert,"Jay-Z was publicly named in a lawsuit against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs weeks after the initial filing, raising questions about what legal moves went down behind closed doors.  The lawsuit accused Jay-Z and Diddy of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000, Fox News Digital previously confirmed. Before Jay-Z was named, the rapper received a demand letter likely in an attempt to settle.  ""Things have escalated,"" Orange County criminal defense lawyer Lauren Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital, as the back-and-forth between Jay-Z's legal team and Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee now plays out in the public eye.  JAY-Z'S ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT: CAN RAP MOGUL FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES?  Fox News Digital looks back at the timeline leading to Jay-Z being named in the bombshell lawsuit:  Diddy accused of raping 13-year-old girl  Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was first accused of raping a 13-year-old while celebrities watched in October. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York on Oct. 20 by Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee on behalf of a Jane Doe.  The unidentified woman ended up at a VMAs afterparty after attempting to gain entry to the awards show at Radio City Music Hall, according to court documents.  ""One of the limousine drivers she spoke to claimed to work for [Diddy],"" the lawsuit read. ""He told her that Combs liked younger girls and said she ‘fit what Diddy was looking for,’ not allowing her into the Awards, but inviting her to an afterparty.""  The girl claimed after being given one drink, she found a room to lie down in because she became ""woozy and lightheaded."" At one point, Combs and two unidentified celebrities entered the room. ""Celebrity A"" allegedly raped the 13-year-old while Combs and ""Celebrity B"" watched. Afterwards, the young girl claimed Combs raped her while ""Celebrity A"" and ""Celebrity B"" watched.  Diddy denied the allegations in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.  WATCH ON FOX NATION: WHAT DIDDY DO?  Jay-Z receives a demand letter regarding the sexual assault lawsuit against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs  At some point, Jay-Z received a demand letter from the anonymous accuser's lawyer – unbeknownst to the public. Jay-Z confirmed this information in his statement denying the rape accusation.  ""My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a ‘lawyer’ named Tony Buzbee ,"" Jay-Z shared in the statement on Roc Nation's social media. ""What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.  ""No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!""  ""Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes."" — Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot  The decision to eventually publicly name Jay-Z was likely due to ""a failure to settle the case,"" a legal expert told Fox News Digital.  ""Jay-Z may have decided that settling the case would suggest to the public that he was somehow involved in the sexual assault of a minor,"" Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot, explained. ""After receiving a demand letter, Jay-Z and his legal team probably pushed back against the Plaintiff's accusations and may have tried to convince her counsel to not proceed with naming him as a Defendant.  ""The Plaintiff's attorney probably made a decision to proceed against Jay-Z after it became apparent that they would not settle the case. Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes.""  Jay-Z files lawsuit claiming extortion under ‘John Doe’  Before Jay-Z was named publicly in the lawsuit accusing him and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of rape, he sued his accuser's lawyer as a celebrity John Doe.  WATCH: JAY-Z ISSUES SCATHING DENIAL TO ALLEGATIONS HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL  On Nov. 18, his lawyers filed a lawsuit against Buzbee. Since then, Jay-Z confirmed he was the plaintiff in the anonymous lawsuit.  ""Plaintiff presently faces a gun to his head,"" the court document, obtained by Fox News Digital, read. Jay-Z's team claimed Buzbee and the anonymous accuser had demanded the rapper ""either repeatedly pay an exorbitant sum of money to stop Defendants from the wide publication of wildly false allegations of sexual assault that would subject [Jay-Z] to opprobrium and irreparably harm [Jay-Z's] reputation, family, career and livelihood, or else face the threat of an untold number of civil suits and financial and personal ruin.""  While Jay-Z accused Buzbee of extortion, legal experts claimed demand letters are typical in these types of cases.  ""It is standard for these types of letters to be sent before filing a case or including a defendant in a case,"" Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital. ""If a case can settle outside of court, that usually benefits everyone involved. It is not extortion, but it can feel like it to the defendant, especially if the ask is high.""  DeGroot added: ""The tone of these letters may vary.

In the new version of the lawsuit, the 13-year-old became disoriented and found a bedroom to rest in after allegedly consuming one drink. Jay-Z, Diddy and female ""Celebrity B"" seemingly followed the girl into the room. She ""immediately recognized all three celebrities,"" according to the court document.  Jay-Z allegedly raped the girl, followed by Diddy's alleged rape of the plaintiff, all while ""celebrity B"" watched, the court document stated.

""Celebrity B"" remains unnamed, but will likely be revealed at some point in the process, according to a legal expert.  ""Since that person's participation appears to be that of a witness, her status is entirely different, unless there is a legal reason,"" DeGroot told Fox News Digital.

""Celebrity B"" is ""undoubtedly"" in communication with Buzbee through a lawyer, Johnson-Norris noted.

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bill-belichick-said-he-always-wanted-coach-college-after-taking-unc-job-dream-come-true,Fox News,right,International,Bill Belichick said he always wanted to coach in college after taking UNC job: 'Dream come true',"From rumors, to a finalized deal, to a press conference, the last 24 hours for the North Carolina Tar Heels have been a whirlwind as legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick will now lead a college football program for the first time in his illustrious career.  Belichick sat in front of the media during his introductory press conference as the new head coach for the Tar Heels – an idea no college football fan would've fathomed until rumors began to swirl last week about his interest in running the program.  It was always thought that Belichick, who is 27 wins away from becoming the head coach with the most victories in NFL history, would return to the pros if he wished to continue coaching.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  But the 72-year-old explained on Thursday afternoon why he chose to go the college route.  ""​​I’ve always wanted to coach in college football,"" Belichick said. ""It just never really worked out. Had some good years in the NFL, so that was OK. But this is really a dream come true.""  BILL BELICHICK AGREES TO BECOME UNC'S NEXT HEAD FOOTBALL COACH  Belichick is obviously being modest by saying his time in the NFL was just ""good.""  Before the Kansas City Chiefs, he developed the New England Patriots into a dynasty, winning six Super Bowls and racking up wins that brought about the argument of greatest NFL head coach of all time.  College football, though, is a completely different beast, especially in this new NIL world. But these aren't waters Belichick just wants to dip his toes in – he's diving straight in and not looking to get out.  ""I didn't come here to leave,"" he said, dispelling thoughts for now that he's just trying to coach again before that next NFL opportunity opens up.  Belichick did say that, while the process may be different, the pros and college do have ""a lot of parallels."" It's why Michael Lombardi is coming in as the team's general manager, someone who knows how Belichick functions given their time together in New England.  ""I think that's the reason for the general structure with Michael as the general manager and myself as the coach and working collaboratively as we have done in a professional structure,"" Belichick explained.  For this big leap to be successful, Belichick knows he just needs to take things one day at a time. That starts with putting together his coaching staff, which he has already touched on with Freddie Kitchens coming aboard. More announcements should be made in the coming weeks.  Recruiting, not drafting, will also be interesting to watch with Belichick, but reports have indicated his wish for UNC to have the proper NIL resources to land top talent to make the program competitive.  As someone who was around the program as a kid – his father, Steve Belichick, coached with the Tar Heels in the 1950s – he understands what it means to be successful in Chapel Hill.

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-rookie-xavier-worthy-says-team-thrives-playing-villain-role-everybody-just-wants-us-lose,Fox News,right,International,Chiefs rookie Xavier Worthy says team thrives playing in villain role: 'Everybody just wants us to lose',"Kansas City Chiefs rookie receiver Xavier Worthy knows it is his job at the end of the day, but he is having a lot of fun playing with his team each week.  How could he not be happy when he is 12-1 to start off his first season in the NFL. Not many rookies get that luxury.  However, the first-round pick learned quickly what comes with the territory of being a team in search of three Super Bowls – playing the villain role.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Worthy, who broke the NFL Scouting Combine 40-yard dash record back in April, said he hears the outside noise, especially those wanting the Chiefs to lose each week.  ""I feel like everybody just wants us to lose,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital after highlighting the fun he had with the DICKS Holiday Shopping Sprint to impact kids in the Kansas City area for the holidays.  CHIEFS' ALTERNATE REALITY: KANSAS CITY WOULD BE 2011 IF THEIR ONE-SCORE GAME RESULTS WERE FLIPPED IN 2024  ""Every week, it’s a new excuse. First, the goal post is helping us. Then, it’s the refs helping us. I mean, we can’t get a break. But it’s cool to have that. It shows that everybody wants us to lose, we have a target on our backs, and we have to continue working each and every week.""  The Chiefs are a dynasty, and Worthy entered the fray right after they defeated the San Francisco 49ers in overtime to collect back-to-back Vince Lombardi trophies.  Just ask any other dynasty in the NFL what happens when they are on top. Fans will raise them up and ultimately want to watch them fall with a new winner crowned.  However, Worthy brings up a reason why some fans cannot stand to watch the Chiefs stack wins. They have been in so many close games this season, but they have maintained their winning streak in those one-score bouts.  For the last 15 games that have been determined by one score, the Chiefs have come out victorious. Yes, the goal post was involved this past week as Matthew Wright doinked it off the left side, but it went through to beat the Los Angeles Chargers. Additionally, there have been some controversial calls that have gone the Chiefs' way in the end.  Being the villain, though, is not something the Chiefs care about. They embrace it, and Worthy is just getting a taste of what Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and other veterans on the team have been feeling since last season.  ""It fuels us,"" Worthy explained. ""A lot of people say it’s hate, like, ‘Oh, people are always going against us.’ But how we look at it, the world’s watching us. You have all these eyes – you make the best of the opportunity with all these eyes on you.""  Worthy is no stranger to having a target on his back after playing for a large college program like the Texas Longhorns.  CHIEFS ARE KINGS OF CLOSING OUT GAMES, AND WHAT ELSE WE LEARNED IN WEEK 14  However, he touched on the senior leadership that helps guide the pact, especially Mahomes, who he continues to build a rapport with each week.  The proof is in the game tape, as Mahomes, scrambling on fourth-and-6 to continue the team's game-winning drive, threw a pass to Worthy with the game on the line, and he came back to the ball, secured it and kept the drive alive.  He even injured himself on the play, but his quarterback trusted him with the game on the line. A little pain is worth it in that case.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play,"" he said. ""I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video. But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  With four games remaining and the AFC West title locked up for the ninth straight season, Worthy knows he will also be a rookie that enjoys playoff football at the end of the regular season.  He is also well aware that the target will be even larger with the Chiefs looking to become the first team ever to win three straight Super Bowls.  If Kansas City has to be the villain to do so, then that is perfectly fine for Worthy, who is solely focused on being the team's hero when it is his turn to make a play.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.  That is exactly what happened with this year's DICK’S Holiday Shopping Sprint, where two lucky winners – Tanisha and her 8-year-old son, AJ, as well as Molly from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City – curated a $2,500 holiday wish list that Worthy collected with his record-breaking speed and brought to them personally.  ""It was fun,"" he said of the experience. ""It was always something I wanted to do just to give back to the community where I’m at, and it was just fun to see the reactions on the kids’ faces. It brightened my day.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Worth took pictures, had some catches and enjoyed the opportunity to make these kids and their families smile.  ""Surprising our athletes with gifts off their list was such a delight,"" said Melissa Christian, vice president of global brand and category marketing at DICK’S Sporting Goods. ""This was another way we could meet our athletes where they are – literally! – and to do to it in record time by having Xavier Worthy, who is known for his speed, shop and deliver to doorsteps was even more fun. He was the perfect partner for this year’s Holiday Shopping Sprint.""  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."

Shawn Carter, known professionally as Jay-Z, and his legal team filed a letter Monday requesting the woman accusing the rapper of raping her when she was 13 years old be identified, Fox News Digital previously confirmed. The woman's lawyer responded, claiming the letter was used as a pretext to submit ""press releases"" disguised as legal filings.

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bill-belichick-unc-head-football-coach,Fox News,right,International,Bill Belichick agrees to become UNC's next head football coach,"Look out Chapel Hill, Bill Belichick is coming.  Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels finalized a deal for the 72-year-old to become their next head football coach, the university officially announced on Wednesday night.  ""I am excited for the opportunity at UNC-Chapel Hill. I grew up around college football with my Dad and treasured those times,"" Belichick wrote in a statement. ""I have always wanted to coach in college and now I look forward to building the football program in Chapel Hill.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  OutKick's Trey Wallace reports that UNC will give Belichick a five-year deal worth upwards of $50 million.  The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach remained interested in returning to the sidelines at some point in the future, but it was always expected that he would make his way back to the NFL after missing out on a new gig following his departure from the New England Patriots before this season. After all, Belichick had been in the league in some role since 1975 prior to this season.  But earlier this week, The Guardian US reported that Belichick agreed to become the new head coach in Chapel Hill, adding that Belichick handed the school a 400 page ""organizational bible"" with structure, payment plans, staffing choices etc.  Wallace reports one of the biggest components to the deal was Belichick having enough NIL money to compete in the recruiting space, which was agreed to. He also wanted to pick his assistant coaches, and UNC is giving them the resources to get who he wants, even if buyouts are necessary.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Among those assistants expected to join the staff is Stephen Belichick, his son who serves as Washington's defensive coordinator. It was reported that the elder Belichick had the unusual request of wanting his son to become his successor, stepping in when he decides to leave the program.  This will mark Belichick's first stint as a college football coach. His father, Steve Belichick, was a longtime assistant coach at Navy. But he did have a stint in the 1950s with the Tar Heels.  Belichick has spent much of the ongoing NFL season in the media spotlight after his interviews for NFL jobs didn't lead to a job offer.  While he interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons in January, the franchise opted against extending an offer. Belichick did not appear to draw much interest from any other NFL team, but his regular appearances on ESPN's ""ManningCast"" and the CW's ""Inside the NFL"" have kept him close to football.  During an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" earlier this week, Belichick confirmed he had talks with UNC about their head coaching vacancy, adding that he spent the 11 months since his departure from the Patriots taking a ""longer look"" at college football throughout the season as opposed to during the spring lead-up to the draft as a pro coach.  ""So it’s been, it’s been a good year for me. I’ve learned a lot,"" Belichick said. ""So, I’ve had the opportunity to talk to Chancellor [Lee] Roberts, and we’ve had a couple of good conversations. So we’ll see how it goes.""  Belichick opted not to go into more detail when asked by McAfee. Instead, Belichick offered a quip about his reputation for giving terse responses during news conferences with the Patriots.  ""Yeah, let’s just leave it at that, Pat,"" Belichick said with a grin. ""I mean, I don’t want to give out too much information. I want to get my press conference aura back.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Belichick shared some details about the makeup of a college program if he were a head coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" he said. ""It would be a professional program — training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history. He finished the 2023 season with 333 career wins — which places him in second on the all-time coaches wins list. Don Shula's 347 wins still leads all coaches."
https://www.foxnews.com/sports/unc-on-board-have-bill-belichick-become-next-head-coach-still-working-out-issues-deal-report,Fox News,right,International,"UNC 'on board' to have Bill Belichick become next head coach, still working out issues with deal","Bill Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels are working to close a deal to make him their next head football coach, which would be his first-ever time coaching in college.  However, ESPN reported that ""there are still issues that both sides need to work through.""  The report adds that the ""ball is in Belichick’s court"" as UNC officials are indeed on board with him taking over the program. And there is expected to be a ""resolution"" soon.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  In fact, OutKick's Trey Wallace reports it's come down to just NIL money, which was among the issues that needed to be worked out in the negotiations. If that can be agreed to, an emergency trustee meeting would be called to finalize the deal.  What exactly are the other issues? Well, the potential role of Belichick’s son, Washington Huskies defensive coordinator Stephen Belichick, is one of them.  It was reported by The Guardian that, among the elder Belichick’s stipulations, his son would be named his heir to the head coach role once the 72-year-old moves on, whenever that would be.  ESPN added Belichick’s salary for taking over and more need to be ironed out before a deal can be agreed to.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  It came as a shock when Belichick’s name was floated for the Tar Heels' vacant position after longtime head coach Mack Brown said he wouldn’t return after this season.  Some of Belichick’s ex-pupils, like Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, had some fun on FOX NFL Sunday this past week mimicking their old coach trying to deal with recruiting in this NIL age of college sports.  ""There’s a lot of things he can do, and obviously he’s tremendous, and even showing his personality. But getting out there on the recruiting trail and dealing with all these college kids,"" Brady said on the NFL pregame show. ""’Listen, do you really want to come here?’"" Brady said, acting as Belichick. ""’I mean, we don’t really want you anyway, but I guess you could come, we’ll figure out if you play.’""  But this wasn’t just a publicity stunt. There’s more than just mutual interest in Belichick’s return to coaching in Chapel Hill.  ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Belichick and UNC officials spent five hours discussing a potential deal on Sunday, and in typical Belichick fashion, he wouldn’t divulge any details during his weekly spot on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Monday morning.  He admitted having a ""couple of good conversations"" with Lee Roberts, UNC’s chancellor, and added, ""We’ll see how that goes.""  If a deal goes through, it would be one of the most polarizing head coach hires for a college program in history, as Belichick has only ever been a head coach in the NFL, where he won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots.  FORMER NFL COACH BRUCE ARIANS OFFERS ADVICE TO BILL BELICHICK AS NORTH CAROLINA FOOTBALL COACHING RUMORS SWIRL  His time with the franchise came to an end before this 2024 season. They mutually parted ways and Belichick’s attempts at finding another role elsewhere were all for naught. He has since joined the sports media space, offering his insight to various outlets, including ESPN, but being open to another opportunity in football was always in the cards.  However, it was always expected that such an opportunity would come from the NFL, and there are several head coaching roles already open in the league, making this situation even more surprising.  But Belichick told McAfee and his crew what would happen if he were to become a college football coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" Belichick said. ""It would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Simply put, Belichick would bring to college football the system he knows works in the NFL, aiming for good players to join his team who will one day turn pro with the tools necessary for easy acclimation.  Time will tell if that program will be at UNC, but it appears some boxes need to be checked before a groundbreaking deal crosses the finish line.

In his first All-Star season, Crochet pitched to a 3.58 ERA over 146 innings with 209 strikeouts and 33 walks.  His swing-and-miss stuff is what the Red Sox hope can be delivered at Fenway Park and beyond this season as a top-line rotation piece.  After the New York Yankees landed Max Fried, another reported Red Sox target in free agency, on an eight-year deal, Boston GM Craig Breslow quickly pivoted to Crochet to make sure they got a key piece for 2025 and beyond.  The Red Sox are not expected to be done, however. They were in on the Soto sweepstakes while also checking in on other position players as they hope to build a team worthy of reaching the postseason.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As for the White Sox, their rebuild continues, and top prospects like the ones they got in this deal are what’s needed to make that work in the long run.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkey-seeks-seeks-purge-pro-us-kurdish-force-helped-defeat-islamic-state-syria,Fox News,right,International,Turkey seeks to purge pro-US Kurdish force that helped defeat Islamic State in Syria,"JERUSALEM — Just hours after meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and discussing the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, Turkey's foreign minister sent a shocking message to Washington by saying his country's goal is to eliminate the main fighting force of the Syrian Kurds, which defeated ISIS in tandem with the U.S..  According to Turkish media, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said in a live broadcast on NTV that ""the elimination of YPG is [Turkey's] strategic goal."" He also noted the country's Kurds must be protected.  Asked about Fidan's comments, the State Department referred Fox News Digital to comments made earlier on Friday after Blinken's meeting with Fidan in Turkey.  The statement said, in part, ""Secretary Blinken emphasized the importance of U.S.-Turkish cooperation in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS mission in Syria.""  SYRIAN DICTATOR BASHAR ASSAD FLEES INTO EXILE AS ISLAMIST REBELS CONQUER COUNTRY  The U.S. has a long-standing military alliance with the Syrian Kurdish military organization, The People’s Defense Units (YPG), in Syria. The YPG is part of a broader organization known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and played a key role in dismantling the Islamic State in Syria.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has seized on the collapse of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s rule to gobble up territory controlled by the pro-American Syrian Kurds, risking hard-won gains against the Islamist State terrorist movement.  Erdoğan's campaign to purge the SDF in northern Syria has created a dangerous security situation in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS), according to Gen. Mazloum Abdi, the SDF’s commander in chief.  In an exclusive interview Thursday, Mazloum told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin, ""We are still under constant attack from the Turkish military and the Turkish-supported opposition, which is called SNA. Eighty drone attacks a day we have from the Turkish military. There is intensive artillery shells. This situation has paralyzed our counterterror operation.""  Islamic State prisoners held in SDF-run detention camps could escape amid the military offensive launched by pro-Turkish forces against the SDF. The SDF has redirected much of its force capability and resources to blunt an aggressive Turkish-backed military offensive.  In 2022, Fox News Digital reported that Erdoğan’s slated invasion of northern Syria could open the floodgates for the release of as many 10,000 Islamic State fighters.  The U.S. on Wednesday brokered a cease-fire between the pro-Turkey Syrian National Army (SNA), the Syrian opposition (TSO) and the SDF.  FALL OF SYRIA'S BASHAR ASSAD IS STRATEGIC BLOW TO IRAN AND RUSSIA, EXPERTS SAY  The U.S. has about 900 troops stationed in northeast Syria who coordinate with the SDF to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State after the new wave of Turkish attacks against the Syrian Kurds.  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., warned the Turks on X, posting, ""In the past I have drafted sanctions targeting Turkey if they engage in military operations against the Kurdish forces who helped President Trump destroy ISIS. I stand ready to do this again in a bipartisan way.  ""We should not allow the Kurdish forces — who helped us destroy ISIS on President Trump’s watch — to be threatened by Turkey or the radical Islamists who have taken over Syria.""  Fox News Digital attempted to contact various Turkish officials, including its embassy spokespeople in Washington and Tel Aviv and its United Nations mission in New York.  ""We have time and again pointed out threats against our national security, posed by the PKK/YPG terrorist network in Syria and Iraq,"" Turkish diplomats previously told Fox News Digital about the Kurdish military forces PKK and YPG. PKK is an abbreviation for the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an organization classified by the U.S. as a terrorist entity.  Efrat Aviv, a professor in the Department of General History at Bar-Ilan University in Israel and a leading expert on Turkey, told Fox News Digital, ""Turkey's actions in Syria further complicate the situation and hinder international efforts to bring about a comprehensive resolution to the conflict. The withdrawal of Turkish forces from the region and the cessation of conflicts with the Kurds could contribute to improving regional stability and efforts to end ISIS terrorism.  TURKEY'S INVASION THREATS SHOULD BE TAKEN 'VERY SERIOUSLY': CYPRUS OFFICIAL  ""Turkey's military actions in Syria jeopardize regional stability and undermine efforts to end ISIS terrorism. The Turkish strikes not only harm the Kurds, but also exacerbate the humanitarian situation in the region, causing significant population displacement.""  Uzay Bulut, a Turkish-born political analyst, told Fox News Digital, ""Erdoğan’s imperial ambition in Syria has not changed. Land grab and demographic change have always been Turkey's plan in Syria. Turkey's military campaigns against Syria have brought nothing but instability to the region and severe persecution of minorities.  ""To prevent further abuses, massacres or forced displacements against Christians, Kurds and Yazidis and to stop the spread of jihadism in the region, the Trump administration should get involved diplomatically to protect religious and ethnic minorities, particularly defenseless Christians, in Syria.""  Syria's Christian population could be as low as 2.5%, down from 10% before the civil war started in 2011. Christian and other ethnic and religious minorities face persecution from the radical Islamist Sunni terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its extremist allies.  ""The ongoing jihadist assault against Syrian Kurds and Christians is led by the al Qaeda offshoot, HTS,"" Bulut said. ""HTS forces are backed by the government of Turkey and have brutalized and displaced religious minority communities in Idlib since 2017. HTS aims to install Islamic rule in Syria.""  The Trump transition team did not respond to Fox News Digital press queries.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  When asked by Fox News Digital if the U.S. was contemplating sanctioning Turkey, a State Department spokesperson said, ""As a general matter, we do not preview sanctions.""  On his trip to the region Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met his Turkish counterpart, and the two discussed the latest developments in the area.  A readout of their meeting noted in part that Blinken ""reiterated calls for all actors in Syria to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Syrians, including members of minority groups, and to prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism."""
https://www.foxnews.com/world/south-korea-lawmakers-vote-impeach-president-over-martial-law-declaration,Fox News,right,International,South Korea lawmakers vote to impeach president over martial law declaration,"South Korean lawmakers on Saturday voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law declaration earlier this month.  The National Assembly passed the motion in a 204-85 vote on Saturday.  Saturday’s vote means that Yoon's presidential powers and duties have been suspended after the copies of a document on the impeachment were delivered to him and to the Constitutional Court. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will now assume the role of acting president.  The court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he's thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  NORTH KOREA CONDEMNS SOUTH KOREA AS ‘FASCIST DICTATORSHIP’ AFTER MARTIAL LAW SCARE  Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung hailed the outcome of the vote, saying the motion's passage proved the people are the country's masters and marked the beginning of a new democracy, according to Yonhap News Agency.  Saturday marked lawmakers' second attempt to impeach the South Korean president. Yoon survived an impeachment vote last weekend after most lawmakers of the ruling People Power Party boycotted the floor vote.  Since then, some PPP lawmakers announced their intentions to vote for Yoon's impeachment in a second vote, as public protests against Yoon intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  Though lasting only six hours, Yoon's Dec. 3 martial law declaration – the first of its kind in more than four decades in South Korea – has thrown the East Asian nation into political turmoil, halting diplomatic activities and rattling financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it.  SOUTH KOREA'S FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER ATTEMPTED SUICIDE AFTER HE WAS ARRESTED OVER MARTIAL LAW PROBE  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree before they withdrew after the parliament rejected it. No major violence occurred.  But in the days since, thousands of protesters have poured into the streets of the capital, Seoul, braving the bitter cold, calling for the president's ouster and arrest. Yoon's conservative supporters, meanwhile, have held counterprotests, denouncing attempts to impeach the president.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea, as law enforcement authorities are investigating whether he and others involved in the martial law declaration committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. If convicted, the leader of a rebellion plot can face the death penalty or life imprisonment.  Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution, but that doesn't extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Yoon's defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul's metropolitan police agency have been arrested over their roles in the martial law case. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations.  The Associated Press contributed to this report."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-freed-syrian-prison-assads-overthrow-taken-country-us-military,Fox News,right,International,American freed from Syrian prison after Assad's overthrow taken out of country by US military,"An American who was released this week after being held in a Syrian prison for seven months has been flown out of the country on a U.S. military helicopter, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Travis Timmerman, who was among thousands of prisoners freed by rebels who overthrew former President Bashar al-Assad over the weekend, said after his release that he had been on a Christian pilgrimage when he illegally crossed into the country seven months ago and was detained.  He told The Associated Press that, along with another Syrian man, the ""liberators"" freed him with around 70 women, some of whom were also being held with their children.  Timmerman said that he wasn’t treated badly while he was held in the infamous Syrian intelligence facility known as Palestine Branch.  TRUMP'S PLEDGE AGAINST ‘FOREVER WARS’ COULD BE TESTED WITH SYRIA IN HANDS OF JIHADIST FACTIONS  But he told the Al-Arabiya TV network that he could hear other men being tortured in the prison every day.  ""It was OK. I was fed. I was watered,"" said Timmerman. ""The one difficulty was that I couldn’t go to the bathroom when I wanted to. I was not beaten, and the guards treated me decently.""  He was allowed out of his cell three times a day to go to the bathroom.  After Assad’s overthrow, he said the rebels came to the prison and ""knocked the door down (of his cell) with a hammer.""  Timmerman was first seen in video that emerged online Thursday after rebels seized Damascus, the country’s capital.  SYRIA'S LIBERATED POLITICAL PRISONS REVEAL GRIM REALITY OF BASHAR ASSAD'S REGIME OF TORTURE  In the video, a bearded Timmerman was lying on a mattress under a blanket in what appeared to be a private house. A group of men in the video said he was being treated well and would be safely returned home, The Associated Press reported.  Palestine Branch, also known as Branch 235, houses nearly a dozen buildings hidden behind high concrete walls, according to The New York Times.  Human Rights Watch reported more than a decade ago that prisoners there were subjected to torture, including electrocutions and beatings.  ""The guards hung me by my wrists from the ceiling for eight days,"" a former prisoner told the organization in 2012. ""After a few days of hanging, being denied sleep, it felt like my brain stopped working. I was imagining things. My feet got swollen on the third day. I felt pain that I have never felt in my entire life. It was excruciating. I screamed that I needed to go to a hospital, but the guards just laughed at me.""  Many prisoners would also die of illnesses or starvation under the deplorable conditions.  At another notorious Syrian prison known as Sednaya, The Free Press, in collaboration with the Center for Peace Communications, also discovered testimonies of torture and executions while investigating it after the fall of Assad’s regime this week.  ""They would call out names at dawn, strip the prisoners of their clothes, and take them away,"" a former inmate told The Free Press. ""We knew from the sound of chains on the platforms that these were executions. Condemned prisoners wouldn’t be fed for three days prior. Once a month, they would search us. During one such search, an officer declared, ‘We’re not here to inspect; we’re here to kill.’""  Since the thousands of prisoners were released, loved ones have been searching for signs of those who went missing in the barbaric prisons.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  ""We slept on top of each other,"" one woman, who said she had been held at Palestine Branch for four and a half months in 2020 along with dozens of other women, told The New York Times. ""They did not feed us, they beat us.""  Fox News' Stephen Sorace and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/australian-jewish-community-alarmed-amid-rising-antisemitism-fear-anxiety,Fox News,right,International,Australia's Jewish community alarmed by rising antisemitism: 'Fear and anxiety',"A devastating arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue is now being investigated as a possible terror attack, drawing worldwide attention to a stark increase in antisemitism in Australia.  Masked vandals set the Adass Israel Synagogue aflame on Dec. 6, in one of several incidents that have left the Jewish community seeking support from government leaders.  On Wednesday, Sky News Australia reported a car was destroyed after being set on fire in a Jewish community in Sydney. At least two, but possibly as many as seven, buildings in the area were vandalized, with one graffiti tag reading ""kill Israiel"" (sic). This rash of hate followed in the wake of a similar incident late last month, when vehicles and a restaurant in the same area were covered with graffiti.  Following the attacks in Sydney, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told Sky News Australia, ""Sydney, per capita, has the second-highest number of Holocaust survivors in the world,"" explaining that they came ""to Australia specifically to be free from this kind of hate.""  JEWISH CHILDREN, TEENS VIOLENTLY ATTACKED IN LONDON: ‘STREETS ARE NO LONGER SAFE’  Worshiper Yumi Friedman told Avi Yemini of Rebel News that he was inside the synagogue when he heard banging on the door and saw glass flying. Friedman later said he smelled fire and burned his hand while attempting to open the synagogue door.  Friedman said that responding police told Jewish worshipers to get on the ground and show their hands. ""They came and arrested us,"" he said. ""It took them a while to realize that we’re Jewish and we didn’t do this.""  Zionism is not a feature of the Haredi Judaism that worshipers at the Adass Israel Synagogue practice. Yemini asked members of the community why they believed the non-Zionist synagogue was targeted. ""Jews are Jews,"" a man wearing a kippah replied. ""They’re anti-Jews,"" another visibly Jewish man told Yemini. ""Not anti-anything else.""  Yemini filmed a protester outside the firebombed synagogue wearing a keffiyeh and a baseball cap featuring the Palestinian flag who held a sign stating ""Nothing is more antisemitic than Zionism.""  Numerous community members interviewed by Yemini said they felt unsupported by the local government. ""People have been attacked here,"" one man reminded Victoria Police Detective Inspector Chris Murray, who was present to address the community. ""Why don’t you put someone in here?""  ""We’re doing our best,"" Murray responded.  Murray told crowds that police would ""do everything"" to ""bring these individuals before the courts."" Though they believed the attack was targeted, Murray said that ""what we don’t know is why.""  Shane Patton, Victoria police chief commissioner, told reporters at a press conference that the firebombing is being investigated as ""a likely terror attack.""  CALLS FOR US TO DO MORE AS ANTISEMITIC ATTACKS SKYROCKET IN EUROPE: ‘ENORMOUSLY PAINFUL’  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been lambasted for his response to the Melbourne attack, which a Sky News Australia host said was ""four days too late."" Yemini documented Albanese’s visit to the Adass Israel Synagogue. When the kippah-wearing prime minister failed to answer questions from assembled reporters, Yemini followed him to the car, telling Albanese that ""yesterday was the first time you didn’t conflate antisemitism and Islamophobia.""  Though it has faced more intolerance, the Jewish population of Australia is around one-eighth the size of the Muslim population, and has been stagnant or declining while the percentage of Muslims has grown. In 2016, Jewish Australians made up 0.5% of the population, according to Monash University. Muslims made up 2.6% of the population in 2016, according to the University of South Australia. Today, Muslims account for 3.2% of the Australian population while 0.4% of the population is Jewish.  In the aftermath of recent attacks, Albanese stated that the Australian Federal Police will be conducting an operation that would ""focus on threats, violence, and hatred"" targeting the Jewish community. Reuters reported that Albanese has allocated $25 million (approximately U.S. $15 million) since 2022 to increase security for Jewish organizations. He has also worked to minimize hate speech and banned the Nazi salute.  Many Jewish Australians believe these efforts are not enough. Earlier this month, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) sent an open letter to Albanese, which it shared with Fox News Digital. The ECAJ explained that ""the very character of this country as a free, democratic and multicultural society is in peril,"" citing the ""fear and anxiety"" experienced by Jewish Australians who question whether it is safe to display signs of their Judaism or publicly celebrate their faith and heritage.  Though the ECAJ expressed gratitude to Albanese for ""swiftly condemning"" the arson in Melbourne, they requested that he act in response to ""what is now a national antisemitism crisis."" Among their requests are an increase in security funding, support for antisemitism education in schools, enforcement of laws against harassment and intimidation, and support for higher government efforts to curtail antisemitism in universities.  COLUMBIA GROUP’S ANTISEMITIC NEWSPAPER DRAWS OUTRAGE FROM NY LAWMAKER, AS UNIVERSITY INVESTIGATES  Albanese’s office did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment about criticisms of the prime minister’s reaction to the Melbourne firebombing, his response to the ECAJ’s letter, and whether the country’s shift regarding a Palestinian state might have an impact on the state of antisemitic hate in Australia.  As it has worldwide, antisemitism has risen dramatically in Australia since Oct. 7, according to an ECAJ report from November 2024. Reporting entities counted 2,062 antisemitic incidents in Australia between Oct. 1, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 495 incidents tallied during the prior 12 months. This represents a 316% increase in expressions of anti-Jewish hate, which began as early as Oct. 8, when the ECAJ reported that Sheikh Ibrahim Daoud told an audience in western Sydney that he was ""elated,"" explaining, ""it’s a day of pride, it’s a day of victory.""  The ECAJ sent Fox News Digital a trove of photographs showing acts of hate directed against Jewish Australians. These included an incident from November 2023, when unknown individuals sprayed ""Kill Jews"" and ""Jew lives here"" on a residential unit in southeast Melbourne, and wrote ""Jew-free zone"" in a Brunswick window, as reported by the Jewish Independent.  The government responded to some major acts of antisemitism. In February, anti-Israel activists released a document featuring the ""names and other personal details"" of 600 Jewish musicians, writers, academics and artists in a WhatsApp group whose communications were also leaked.  Seven months later, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus announced a proposed sentence of up to six years in prison for those who release individuals’ private details in order to cause harm. The punishment would increase to seven years if a victim was targeted because of their race, religion or sexual orientation, among other factors.  In recognition of the rising intolerance in Australia, on Dec. 9, the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory warning Jews to ""exercise extreme caution"" if visiting the country. As Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the center’s director of global social action, explained, authorities there have failed ""to stand up against persistent demonization, harassment and violence against Jews and Jewish institutions in Australia.""

Several videos posted to social media showed the former boxing champion surrounded by a group of people while shopping at Hatton Gardens in London. The crowd, seemingly more agitated, followed Mayweather into the street.  Videos showed the angry group shouting expletives as Mayweather’s security attempted to get him into a black SUV and away from the scene.

A source told The Sun that someone had questioned Mayweather over his support while shopping, to which the American boxer doubled down. The source added that someone then ""took a swing"" at Mayweather.  ""Floyd took a few hits during it, but his security was trying to push people back,"" the source told the outlet.  FLOYD MAYWEATHER SHARES MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AFTER HAMAS ATTACKS: 'I STAND WITH ISRAEL'  Floyd addressed the reports with a statement posted to Instagram on Tuesday. He denied being ""touched in any way.""  ""Let me set the record straight... there's no truth to the rumors going around. I wasn't punched or touched in any way. What you're seeing is just my security doing their job to keep things under control.  ""I was in the UK for a quick 48-hour stop to do some shopping, and unfortunately, people let jealousy and negativity fuel false stories,"" he continued. ""I'm perfectly fine, and there's really nothing more to it.""

""​​Over the next year, every orphan in Israel will be visited by the Floyd Mobile and receive special birthday gifts. To all the widows and orphans: keep your heads held high as we honor the cherished memories of those who have passed,"" he wrote in a post on Instagram.  Mayweather, 47, has been outspoken about his support for Israel. He has taken several trips there and in October met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .  ""It was an honor to meet with you today. Your strength and courage are unmatched, and your commitment to protecting the Jewish people and citizens of Israel is truly inspiring. Keep using your voice and never back down,"" he said in a post at the time.  ""This week in Israel has been deeply emotional for me. Visiting injured soldiers, meeting families of fallen heroes, and connecting with the people of Israel has been a humbling experience."""
https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-wants-establish-relations-syria-says-attack-becomes-threat,Fox News,right,International,Netanyahu wants to establish ‘relations’ with Syria but says Israel will attack it if becomes a threat,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday he wants to establish ""relations"" with the new regime in Syria after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, but he warned Israel will not hesitate to attack the Middle Eastern nation should it pose a threat.  ""We want relations with the new regime in Syria,"" Netanyahu said in a live address. ""But if this regime allows Iran to return to establishing itself in Syria or allows the transfer of Iranian weapons or any other weapons to Hezbollah or [if it] attack[s] us, we will respond strongly. And we will exact a heavy price.  ""What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this regime.""  ISRAEL DEPLOYS PARATROOPERS TO SYRIA IN 'DEFENSE ACTIVITIES' AFTER FALL OF ASSAD  It remains unclear who exactly will take over the leadership of Syria or what that government will look like now that rebel forces control Damascus.  Overnight on Monday, Israel launched massive strikes against Syrian military targets, including two Syrian naval sites, the Al-Bayda port and the Latakia port, where 15 Syrian naval vessels were docked, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed Tuesday afternoon.  ""Manned aircraft flew hundreds of hours over Syrian airspace, conducting over 350 aerial strikes together with fighter jets,"" the IDF reported.  Israel said a ""wide range of targets were struck"" including anti-aircraft batteries, Syrian Air Force airfields and dozens of weapons depot sites in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyr that housed sophisticated weaponry like ballistic and cruise missiles, UAVs, fighter jets, attack helicopters and tanks.  Netanyahu appeared to claim the strikes were similar to actions taken by Britain during World War II when it bombed a French fleet at the Algerian port of Mers-el-Kébir to prevent the ships from falling into the hands of the Nazis.  NETANYAHU HAILS 'HISTORIC' FALL OF BASHAR ASSAD IN SYRIA, CREDITS ISRAELI ATTACKS ON HEZBOLLAH, IRAN  It is unclear if any casualties were inflicted in Israel’s overnight strikes, though the United Nations on Tuesday condemned the attacks as well as Israel’s military encroachment beyond the Golan Heights and into a demilitarized buffer zone.  ""We are continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. This needs to stop,"" U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen said, calling Israel’s developments ""troubling.""  ""This is extremely important,"" he added. ""We need to see a stop to the Israeli attacks, and we need to make sure that the conflict in the northeast stops. And we need to make sure that there are no conflicts developing between the different armed groups.""  Israel received some international criticism after it sent a military contingent this week beyond the Golan Heights, a contested area that Jerusalem seized in 1967 and which is still internationally recognized as a part of Syria, though the U.S. recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the area.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  ""We're against these types of attacks. I think this is a turning point for Syria.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-pardon-shielded-own-actions-criminal-enterprise,Fox News,right,International,Biden’s three biggest lies about his family’s shady business dealings,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!  President Joe Biden lied from start to finish about his family’s influence-peddling racket. He recently issued a sweeping pardon to his son, Hunter Biden, contradicting his repeated assurances that he would not interfere. This pardon may be one of the most comprehensive in U.S. history, encompassing over a decade of corruption. While some have drawn parallels between this pardon and President Gerald Ford’s pardon of former President Richard Nixon, the comparison falls short. Ford aimed to heal a divided nation; Biden is shielding himself and his family from accountability.  Unlike the corporate media and Democrats, who sought to shield Biden until his political future was doomed, observers of the Biden crime family’s corrupt practices are unsurprised by this latest contradiction. Biden’s claim that he would not pardon Hunter Biden is part of a broader pattern of deception regarding his family’s business dealings in order to conceal his involvement.  At the start of this Congress, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee launched an investigation into Joe Biden’s involvement in his family’s business dealings. Despite stonewalling from the Biden administration, we followed the Bidens’ money trail, exposing the 20 shell companies they set up to hide the shady foreign payments they received, all with Joe Biden at the center of the family business.  DEMOCRATS FRUSTRATED BY HUNTER PARDON CONSIDER WITHHOLDING FUTURE BIDEN PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DONATIONS: REPORT  Our investigation has exposed how Joe Biden lied repeatedly about his involvement in these schemes that enriched the Bidens to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Here are some of the biggest lies that we exposed during our investigation.  1. Hunter Biden laptop as Russian disinformation  In October 2020, days before the presidential election, the Biden campaign and now Secretary of State Antony Blinken, orchestrated a misinformation campaign to discredit the contents of Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop, including evidence of Joe Biden’s involvement in his influence-peddling schemes.  These disgraced 51 former intelligence officials claimed the laptop contained all the hallmarks of Russian disinformation, and Joe Biden parroted their claim during the 2020 presidential debate. Twitter removed the New York Post’s article about the laptop, even though former Twitter executives admitted before our committee that it did not violate the platform's policies.  We now know from the testimony of IRS whistleblower, Gary Shapley, that the FBI verified the authenticity of Hunter Biden’s laptop in November 2019. Special Counsel David Weiss, who led the federal criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, also used the laptop as evidence in court.  2. ‘I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings’  Biden repeatedly claimed he never discussed his son’s business dealings. However, evidence uncovered during our investigation contradicts this assertion. Evidence obtained by our committee reveals then-Vice President Biden spoke, dined or had coffee with nearly all of Hunter Biden’s foreign business associates.  Devon Archer, a Biden family associate, confirmed during a transcribed interview that when Joe Biden was Vice President, Joe Biden variously dined with Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina, Kazakhstani oligarch Kenes Rakishev, and Burisma’s corporate secretary Vadym Pozharsky at Café Milano in Washington, D.C.  These dinners occurred as the foreign nationals or their affiliated entities were collectively paying Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, millions of dollars. Then-Vice President Joe Biden also met with Jonathan Li, a Chinese national who was Hunter Biden’s associate, and wrote a college letter of recommendation for his daughter. Even when presented with this evidence, President Biden continued to lie to the American people.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION  Rob Walker, a Biden family associate who was involved in the Biden’s dealings with Chinese and Romanian entities, confirmed during a transcribed interview that Joe Biden met with the now-missing Chairman of CEFC Ye Jianming as Hunter Biden and his associates received $3 million from a Chinese entity CEFC controlled.  Jason Galanis, another Biden family business associate, testified that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone with Yelena Baturina. Joe Biden ended the call by stating, ""Ok then, you be good to my boy."" A few days later, Baturina committed to a ""hard order"" of $10-20 million to an entity benefitting Hunter Biden.  Biden repeatedly claimed he never discussed his son’s business dealings. However, evidence uncovered during our investigation contradicts this assertion. Evidence obtained by our committee reveals then-Vice President Biden spoke, dined or had coffee with nearly all of Hunter Biden’s foreign business associates.  3. ""My son has not made money … in China""  During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden told the American people that his son did not make money in China. However, our investigation has uncovered that Hunter Biden and other Biden family members received millions from China for unknown services.  Additionally, we traced how $40,000 in Chinese money landed in Joe Biden’s personal bank account. When confronted with the fact that his family did indeed receive money from China, President Biden lied again and said it was not true that his family received money from China.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As the truth came out during our investigation, the Biden camp tried to move the goalposts from Joe ""never spoke"" with his son about his business dealings to ""the president was never in business with his son."" All these lies have been committed to hide the fact that Joe Biden was the family business. At a hearing, where former Biden family associates were under oath, they confirmed Joe Biden’s involvement in his family’s business and that he was ""the brand.""  IRS whistleblowers, Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, confirmed under oath that the Department of Justice prohibited them from following evidence that would have led to Joe Biden. Joe Biden has long prided himself on his integrity, yet his legacy will be defined by his repeated falsehoods. Joe Biden has lied for a living."
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/assad-arrives-moscow-granted-asylum-russia,Fox News,right,International,"Assad arrives in Moscow, is granted asylum by Russia","Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, who fled the country Saturday as rebels closed in on the capital of Damascus, has arrived in Moscow and has been granted asylum by the Russian government, according to Russian News Agency Tass.  Speculation about where Assad might land has been widespread since the longtime dictator fled the country, with allies such as Iran and Russia being at the top of the list.  TRUMP URGES US TO STAY OUT OF SYRIAN CIVIL WAR, BLAMING OBAMA FOR FAILURE AS ISLAMISTS CLOSE IN ON CAPITAL  Assad was forced to flee the country after a coalition of largely radical Islamist groups led a sweeping offensive across Syria, culminating in the capture of the country's capital city and the fall of Assad's regime, which had seen his family rule Syria for over 50 years.  The offensive was the latest development in a bloody civil war that has ravaged Syria for almost 14 years, a war that also led to the rise of the Islamic State terrorist organization and yearslong interventions by countries such as the United States, Russia, Iran and Turkey.  ISLAMIST REBELS IN SYRIA CATCH ASSAD, PUTIN, IRAN REGIMES OFF GUARD GIVING US NEW MIDEAST HEADACHE  Assad has been a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had for more than a decade dedicated military resources to the defense of Assad's regime and its government forces.  Assad now arrives in Russia with his family, according to an Interfax news agency report, citing a Kremlin source.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/kosovo-accuses-serbia-terrorist-attack-resembling-russian-actions-ukraine,Fox News,right,International,Kosovo accuses Serbia of 'terrorist attack' resembling Russian actions in Ukraine,"The Kosovo government has accused Serbia of blowing up a crucial pipeline that supplies water and electricity to the ethnically Serb population in the north of Kosovo. Even more troubling, some in Kosovo claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have even had a hand in it.  ""Serbia acts as a key player in the Kremlin’s bid for chaos in the Balkans, so Putin can have leverage over Western powers who do not want the violence to escalate further,"" Ivana Stradner, research fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.  Russia has deep historical, cultural and religious connections to the Balkans, and narratives sympathetic to Russia often emanate from the Serbian Orthodox Church. Stradner says Putin exploits these religious and ethnic divisions in the Balkans, pushing the region to the brink of war. She also noted that the Serbian president also benefits from chaos in the Balkans, using it to strengthen his grip on power.  TENSIONS RISE AMID CLAIMS OF RUSSIA, SERBIA INTERFERENCE IN KOSOVO FOLLOWING RECENT BLOODSHED  ""Vucic has employed a strategy of escalating and de-escalating crises in Kosovo to portray himself as a source of stability, leveraging his position as a bargaining chip with the West,"" Stradner added.  Agim Nesho, former Albanian ambassador to the U.S. and the United Nations, told Fox News Digital that, ""Russia has openly stated that it wants the Western Balkans to be a neutral region and finds it difficult to accept that most Balkan countries are NATO members.""  He continued, ""Events in Montenegro, the assassination attempt on President Djukanović, and the rise of pro-Russian parties show that Russia is present. Russia has no support in Kosovo and Albania, which are openly pro-American due to the role of the USA in supporting the Albanian nation since the beginning of the last century.""  Some experts are cautious as accusations and information is often fluid following crises in the Balkans.  ""This latest escalation, much like the previous ones, involves serious allegations - ranging from Kosovo’s claim that the Serbian government orchestrated these events to suspicions of Russian involvement,"" Helena Ivanov, associate fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital.  Ivanov warned that previous rounds of escalation and allegations lacked concrete evidence and that many of the claims remain conjecture until a full investigation is completed.  Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti said at a news conference that the attack on critical infrastructure was similar to Russia's actions targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine. So far, there is no evidence to suggest Russia had any involvement.  Kurti placed the blame squarely on Serbia and President Vucic for plotting what Kosovo is calling a terrorist attack on the water supply canal in the northern town of Zubin Potok.  ZELENSKYY WARNS RUSSIA WANTS TO CAUSE 'EXPLOSION' IN THE BALKANS  ""All evidence reveals a continuation of Serbia's strategy of aggression, with the Vučić regime exploiting a plethora of resources, including ties with organized crime, in their effort to inflict harm and cause instability within Kosovo,"" Ilir Dugolli, Kosovo’s ambassador to the U.S., told Fox News Digital.  ""This is only the latest in the long list of acts of aggression by Serbia,"" the ambassador added.  Approximately 20 kilos of explosives were used in the massive blast in what Ambassador Dugolli called a highly sophisticated manner, further indicating the professional preparation and execution of the operation.  President Vucic adamantly denied the accusations, calling them ""baseless.""  Vucic claimed in a post on Instagram that the accusations against Serbia are intended to tarnish Serbia’s international reputation and undermine stability in the Balkans region. The president is also calling for a ""thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation"" into what he called an act of sabotage.  Serbian Foreign Minister Marko Djuric told Fox News Digital that the sabotage that took place in the north of Kosovo is a serious threat to peace and stability, and he reiterated Vucic’s demand for a thorough investigation under international supervision.  LONGTIME FOES SERBIA AND KOSOVO NEARING NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS  Djuric also repeated Vucic’s claims that the aims of the operation were to discredit Serbia.  ""We have grounds to believe that this was a hybrid attack aimed at discrediting Serbia, and that is why we continue to emphasize that it is in our immediate interest to identify the perpetrators and masterminds behind this attack,"" Djuric told Fox News Digital.  Djuric suggested that Kurti could be behind the attack, but did not back up the claim with evidence, but he also made sure to point out that Serbia was ready to offer any assistance to the investigation.  Kosovo’s Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla said that eight suspects linked to the attack were arrested and that the damage to the canal had been fixed. Svecla also said that Kosovo police raided 10 locations and confiscated uniforms, heavy weaponry and other military equipment.  Kurti and Vucic met with the European Union’s new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas in Brussels. Kallas said in a post on X that the only way to EU membership for both parties is through normalization of their relations.  Both Serbia and Kosovo are EU aspirants, and ending their feud is a core requirement for gaining membership. Failure to honor their obligations or ratcheting up tensions will have negative consequences for their EU accession processes and block any potential EU financial aid. The ongoing dispute and the recent turmoil remain major obstacles to EU membership for both.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Conflict between Serbia and Kosovo following the 1999 war is unresolved and is a roadblock to their normalization process. Kosovo was a former province of Serbia and was once integrated within the nation of Yugoslavia. NATO led a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, which comprised Serbia and Montenegro, to defend Kosovo’s ethnic Albanians against violence from Belgrade. Nearly a decade later, in 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, along with its historic patron, Russia, refuses to recognize its independence.  Tensions are especially fought in the north of Kosovo, where ethnic Serbs make up a majority of the territory and refuse to recognize Kosovo’s independence. Serbs in northern Kosovo still look to Belgrade as their capital."

Local news outlets identified the woman as 24-year-old Kamilla Beliatskaya.

THAILAND SCHOOL BUS BURSTS INTO FLAMES OUTSIDE BANGKOK, 23 FEARED DEAD, OFFICIALS SAY  Water rescue teams attempted to search the area for Beliatskaya, but operations were suspended after about 30 minutes because wave conditions continued to worsen.  Earlier in the day, Jet Ski operators removed their vehicles from the beach due to hazardous conditions.  Khaosod English reported that the incident happened near the Laad Koh viewpoint in Moo 6, Bo Phut District, Surat Thani Province in Thailand.

""While the incident location isn’t a swimming area but rather a viewpoint for scenery, the victim may have been caught off guard by the unexpected wave surge.""  At about 11 p.m. on Saturday, police received a report that staff from the Impeña Resort Hotel discovered a body on Chaweng Noi Beach. The body was determined to be that of Beliatskaya.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-zealand-scientists-suspect-specimen-worlds-rarest-whale-died-head-injuries,Fox News,right,International,New Zealand scientists suspect specimen of world’s rarest whale died from head injuries,"Scientists suspect the first complete specimen ever recorded of the world’s rarest whale died from head injuries, an expert said Friday.  The first dissection of a spade-toothed whale, a type of beaked whale, was completed last week after a painstaking examination at a research center near the New Zealand city of Dunedin, the local people who led the scientific team, Te Rūnanga Ōtākou, said in a statement issued by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.  WHALE CAUGHT ON CAMERA SURPRISING NEW YORK CITY RESIDENTS DURING SWIM NEAR BROOKLYN  A near-perfectly preserved 5-meter (16-foot) male was found washed up on a South Island beach in July. It was the first complete specimen ever recorded. There have only been seven known sightings and never of a living spade-toothed whale.  New Zealand conservation agency beaked whale expert Anton van Helden said the whale’s broken jaw and bruising to the head and neck led scientists to believe that head trauma may have caused its death.  ""We don’t know, but we suspect there must have been some sort of trauma, but what caused that could be anyone’s guess,"" van Helden said in a statement.  All varieties of beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers didn’t know how the spade-toothed type processed its food.  The scientific team found the specimen had nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, the statement said.  Among the more interesting finds were tiny vestigial teeth in the upper jaw.  ""These little teeth embedded in the gum tells us something about their evolutionary history. It’s remarkable to see this and it’s just another thing that we had no idea about,"" van Helden said.  ""It’s a week I’ll never forget in my life, it’s certainly a highlight and it’s the start of the storytelling around this beautiful animal,"" van Helden added.  The dissection was also notable because scientists and curators worked together with local Māori people to incorporate Indigenous knowledge and customs into each step of the process.  Following the dissection, the local iwi, or tribe, will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts retained by the iwi.  To Māori, whales are a taonga -– a precious treasure -– and the creature has been treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation.  The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand’s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile’s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986."

Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned last week following a no-confidence vote, leaving France without a functioning government.  Bayrou leads the centrist Democratic Movement, known as MoDem, which he founded in 2007.  French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday named centrist ally François Bayrou as prime minister, after a historic parliamentary vote ousted the previous government last week.  Bayrou, 73, a crucial partner in Macron’s centrist alliance, has been a well-known figure in French politics for decades. His political experience is seen as key in efforts to restore stability as no single party holds a majority at the National Assembly.  Macron’s office said in a statement that Bayrou ""has been charged with forming a new government.""  SOCIAL MEDIA REACTS TO TRUMP 'DOMINATING WORLD LEADERS' WITH MACRON HANDSHAKE DURING MEETING IN FRANCE  Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned last week following a no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly, leaving France without a functioning government.  Macron in an address to the nation vowed to remain in office until his term ends in 2027.  Macron’s centrist alliance does not have a majority in parliament and Bayrou's Cabinet will need to rely on moderate lawmakers from the left and the right to be able to stay in power. Some conservatives are expected to be part of the new government.  Macron’s strategy aims at preventing far-right leader Marine Le Pen from holding ""make or break"" power over the government. Le Pen helped oust Barnier by joining her National Rally party’s forces to the left to pass the no-confidence motion last week.  Bayrou's appointment is also in line with Macron’s efforts to build a non-aggression pact with the Socialists so that they commit not to vote against the government in any future confidence motion.  Bayrou leads the centrist Democratic Movement, known as MoDem, which he founded in 2007.  In 2017, he supported Macron’s first presidential bid and became a weighty partner in the French president’s centrist alliance.  At the time, he was appointed justice minister, but he quickly resigned from the government amid an investigation into the MoDem’s alleged embezzlement of European Parliament funds.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Bayrou this year was cleared in the case by a Paris court, which found eight other party officials guilty and sentenced the party to pay a fine.  Bayrou became well known to the French public when he was education minister from 1993 to 1997 in a conservative government.  He was three times a candidate for president, in 2002, 2007 and 2012."

Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani vowed to dissolve the Assad regime's remnant security forces as well as close prisons that had been used to house political dissidents.  Thousands of Syrians stormed Assad's various prison facilities across the country as his regime fell in hopes of releasing their incarcerated friends and family members. Thousands were released alive, but others were found dead and still others remain missing.  U.S. prosecutors named two Syrian officials who they say ran a torture facility at Mezzeh air force base in the Syrian capital, Damascus. The U.S. alleges that their victims included political prisoners, peaceful protesters and a 26-year-old American woman who was later believed to have been executed.  TRUMP URGES US TO STAY OUT OF SYRIAN CIVIL WAR, BLAMING OBAMA FOR FAILURE AS ISLAMISTS CLOSE IN ON CAPITAL  The U.S. indictment names Jamil Hassan, director of the Syrian air force’s intelligence branch, who prosecutors say oversaw a prison and torture center at the Mezzeh air force base in the capital, Damascus, and Abdul Salam Mahmoud, who prosecutors say ran the prison.  The most notorious of Assad's prison facilities was Saydnaya Prison, however, which lies just outside Damascus.  ISLAMIST REBELS IN SYRIA CATCH ASSAD, PUTIN, IRAN REGIMES OFF GUARD GIVING US NEW MIDEAST HEADACHE  Syrian citizens have flocked to the prison in the days since Assad's fall on Sunday, breaking open cells and scouring what images reveal to be a labyrinthine prison. While dozens were freed on Sunday, virtually no one has been found since.  ""Where is everyone? Where are everyone’s children? Where are they?"" said Ghada Assad, breaking down in tears.  Syrians are continuing to search the facility, however, searching for hidden cells as well as documents that might shed light on their family members' fates.  ASSAD ARRIVES IN MOSCOW, IS GRANTED ASYLUM BY RUSSIA  ""There is not a home, there is not a woman in Syria who didn’t lose a brother, a child or a husband,"" said Khairiya Ismail, 54, said of the prison and Assad's rule.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  An estimated 150,000 people were detained or went missing in Syria since 2011. Tens of thousands of them are believed to have gone through Saydnaya, according to the Associated Press.  Amnesty International estimated that there were between 10,000 and 20,000 people being held in the prison as of 2017. The organization also claimed that there were routine mass executions.  The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-group-looks-kidnapped-americans-syria-after-fall-assad-regime-wont-leave-stone-unturned,Fox News,right,International,US group looks for kidnapped Americans in Syria after fall of Assad regime: won't 'leave a stone unturned',"A U.S. nonprofit headquartered in Washington, D.C., is on the ground in Syria looking for kidnapped Americans in the aftermath of the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force (SETF), told Fox News Digital in an interview from Damascus that he and six members of his team arrived in the capital Wednesday to look for Americans kidnapped or held captive by the ousted Assad regime, most notably, American freelance journalist Austin Tice and Syrian American psychotherapist Dr. Majd Kamalmaz.  ""God willing, he's alive. God willing, we can find him and bring him home,"" Moustafa said of Tice. ""Same for Majd, same for the other Americans whose names are not public.""  Tice, who traveled to Syria as the country’s civil war was erupting, was kidnapped in 2012 while reporting in Daraya, a Damascus suburb. He was seen on a video released months after his capture wearing a black blindfold and being led away by a group of men shouting ""Allahu Akbar.""  Tice has not been seen or heard from since. The Syrian government has always denied holding Tice or other Americans.  Kamalmaz, a U.S. citizen who helped survivors of Hurricane Katrina and refugees from war-torn Syria and Kosovo recover from trauma and PTSD, was detained at a government checkpoint in Damascus while visiting a family member in February 2017.  U.S. officials presented the Kamalmaz family with classified information earlier this year, saying they believe the humanitarian died in Syria’s notorious prison system .  He likely died within a year or two of his detainment, his daughter Maryam told Fox News Digital in June, citing U.S. officials. The officials did not say how or where Dr. Kamalmaz died.  ""We will not leave a stone unturned while I'm here in Damascus, and I hope to find them,"" said Moustafa.  ASSAD ARRIVES IN MOSCOW, IS GRANTED ASYLUM BY RUSSIA  The SETF leader has several geolocations from sources and tips and has dispatched his team to specific locations in search of Tice .  ""Now that Damascus is free, we have no restrictions. We can go anywhere,"" he added.  Moustafa praised Tice for his bravery and for traveling to Syria to report on the country’s brutal civil war and cover the plight of civilians in the early years of the outbreak.  ""The very least that we can do is to look for him . And for a long time, we could only look for him through calling people, trying to find people that had been – that had come out of detention, seeing if they've seen him,"" he told Fox News Digital.  Joel Rayburn, the former U.S. special envoy for Syria, told Fox News Digital earlier this year the ousted Assad regime viewed Tice and other detainees as ""cards"" to use as leverage and to get concessions.  ""We know it's almost certain that they have them in their custody, or they've had them in their custody, or they know definitively what happened to those people, but they're absolutely not forthcoming,"" Rayburn said.  The U.S. State Department is now offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on Tice and has conveyed to the leading Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that finding the journalist remains a top priority.  ""In all of our communications with parties that we know talk to HTS, we have sent very clearly the message that, as they move through Syria liberating prisons, that our top priority is the return of Austin Tice,"" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.  A Syrian journalist who was imprisoned by the Assad regime claims he was detained in a Damascus jail in the Kafr Sousa neighborhood with Tice at the same time until as recently as 2022, according to a report from The Sunday Times.  AUSTIN TICE: FAMILY OF JOURNALIST KIDNAPPED IN SYRIA 12 YEARS AGO SAY HE'S STILL ALIVE, CITING ‘VETTED’ SOURCE  Moustafa told Fox News Digital he was aware of the article and plans to go ""straight there"" in the coming days to find out more information.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  ""It is every Syrian's job to do everything they can to get Austin back to his mother and his father, to his country, to his home,"" he said."

The move is part of a 10% global workforce cut that the company announced in October, which is expected to impact approximately 17,000 jobs within Boeing.  A total of 2,199 Boeing workers in the state of Washington – where its workforce totals more than 60,000 – will be laid off over the next few months, Fox Business reported in November.  Another 200 or so employees will be laid off in Oregon, South Carolina and Missouri during the same timeframe.  BOEING ANNOUNCES LAYOFFS ACROSS FLORIDA AS MOUNTING CONCERNS ABOUT THE COMPANY CONTINUE TO GROW  According to Boeing, ""only a very small number"" of employees will lose their jobs in December, ""while the majority will exit in mid-January.""

https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/dollar-tree-could-drop-some-products-tariffs-enacted,Fox News,right,Business,Dollar Tree could drop some products if tariffs are enacted,"Dollar Tree said Wednesday it may adjust or even eliminate certain products if President-elect Trump’s proposed tariffs take effect.  The discount retailer, which has high exposure to China, told analysts it has a ""wide range of potential actions"" it can take to mitigate additional tariffs if they materialize, including changing product details or sizes and even getting rid of items altogether if they become too expensive.  Under the proposals, a universal 10%-20% tariff would be imposed on imports from all foreign countries, and an additional 60%-100% tariff would be imposed on imports specifically from China. Last month, Trump reiterated the threat, saying he would issue an executive order upon taking office to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all products coming into the U.S.  TRUMP'S PROPOSED TARIFFS COULD DRIVE UP FOOD PRICES, EXPERTS SAY  Dollar Tree said the last time the retailer faced this issue, in 2018 and 2019, it adjusted its products and negotiated lower costs with suppliers.  ""Those options are still at our disposal,"" interim CEO Michael Creedon told analysts on an earnings call Wednesday. ""On top of those, we now have detailed plans in place to shift supply sources for most of our products to alternate countries, and multi-price gives us additional flexibility on our product assortment.""  According to a regulatory filing, Dollar Tree directly imports as much as 43% of its total retail value purchases, with the vast majority from China.  ""China is the source of a vast majority of our direct imports, and we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported,"" the company said in a March 2024 filing.  Dollar Tree, which lost its CEO last month and continues to contend with lackluster demand and a highly competitive landscape, is the latest in a string of economists and retailers, including heavy hitters such as Walmart, who have commented on how tariffs would affect business.  GOLDMAN SACHS: TRUMP TAX CUTS, DEREGULATION WILL BOOST GROWTH; TARIFFS COULD BE A DRAG  Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey warned tariffs ""are going to be inflationary.""  ""Likely consumers are going to pay more for the items that they buy and that these tariffs are applied to,"" he told FOX Business.  While Rainey said two-thirds of the items the company sells are made, grown or assembled in the U.S., he said the company is ""in no way immune to this.""  Goldman Sachs warned in a note that Trump's proposed plans would add a tax on 43% of U.S. imports and could push inflation higher by nearly 1%.  Dollar Tree  ""Using our rule of thumb that every 1 [percentage point] increase in the effective tariff rate would raise core [personal consumption expenditures] PCE by 0.1%, we estimate that the proposed tariff increases would boost core PCE prices by 0.9% if implemented,"" the note, written by Goldman Sachs economists Alec Phillips and Ronnie Walker, states.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, Trump's pick for his press secretary once he takes office, previously told FOX Business that, during Trump's first term, the tariffs imposed on China ""created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation.""  She said Trump plans to restore the economy, in part, by ""re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy."""
https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/penn-wharton-model-shows-ways-trump-admin-could-lower-debt-while-sustaining-economic-growth,Fox News,right,Business,Penn Wharton model shows ways Trump admin could lower debt while sustaining economic growth,"A new analysis by the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM) outlines policies that would reduce federal debt while spurring long-term economic growth, as the incoming Trump administration is due to face policy debates over taxes, spending and debt next year.  The federal government faces several key policy deadlines in 2025, starting with the debt limit suspension ending in January, which will require Congress and President-elect Trump to raise the debt limit to avoid default. Spending caps on the discretionary budget are set to expire when fiscal year 2025 ends in September, while portions of the Trump-era tax cuts are scheduled to sunset at the end of next year.  The confluence of those deadlines will leave policymakers facing a debate over how to address the massive national debt and spending growth, as well as resetting tax policies. PWBM's policy illustration focuses on four areas — simplifying the tax code, reducing tax-induced distortions, implementing taxes to address negative externalities and reinforcing the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare.  ""A common misunderstanding is that serious debt reduction must come at the expense of economic growth or the social safety net. We show this is incorrect,"" PWBM's analysts wrote. ""The reforms herein produce sustained debt reduction, grow the economy, reduce carbon emissions, almost fully close current gaps in working-age health-care coverage, and reduce poverty among retirees.""  US NATIONAL DEBT HITS A NEW RECORD: $36 TRILLION  The tax simplification outlined in the PWBM analysis includes taxing capital gains and dividends at ordinary income tax rates, as well as taxing capital gains at death without a stepped-up basis starting in 2025.  It would expand the employment tax base to cover all pass-through income, disallow all itemized deductions except for charitable deductions, remove the income exclusion of employer-sponsored health insurance premiums from taxable income and introduce mandatory health savings accounts that can cover up to $3,000 per year in out-of-pocket health care expenses.  PWBM's illustration would replace the standard deduction and personal exemptions with a partially refundable tax credit and lower the top income tax rate from 37% to 28% with no marginal rates above that.  It also includes a $50-per-ton carbon tax on coal, oil and natural gas products starting in 2025, which it estimates would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 7% in the short run and nearly 16% by 2054.  SOCIAL SECURITY CRISIS: BENEFICIARIES FACE 21% BENEFIT CUT WITHOUT REFORMS, SAYS CRFB  PWBM's analysis notes that the aging of America's population is straining the finances of Social Security and Medicare, as retirees are living longer and there are relatively fewer working-age families supporting more retirees. It suggests that the U.S. can't rely on economic growth alone to stabilize those programs' finances, so policy reforms are needed to achieve that.  ""The United States cannot grow its way out of the shortfalls facing these two major mandatory spending programs: the spending in both programs is either explicitly or implicitly indexed for growth. Both programs materially reduce the accumulation of savings and reduce the incentive to work, which reduces growth,"" PWBM said.  Among the policy changes would be raising the full-benefit Social Security retirement age from 67 to 70, a shift that would be phased in between 2037 and 2056 — so it wouldn't affect individuals who are older than 50 in 2025. New minimum and maximum benefits would also be implemented in 2037.  ECONOMIST OFFERS BIPARTISAN PLAN TO AVOID FINANCIAL CRISIS BY STABILIZING AMERICA'S SURGING NATIONAL DEBT  The Medicare eligibility age would also be raised from 65 to 67, with the change fully phased in by 2036 under the illustration. It would also convert Medicare to a premium support system in which beneficiaries would choose from different insurance plans, with the federal government sharing the cost of premiums.  With the U.S. population projected to decline without immigration and current immigration levels insufficient to address the narrowing gap between workers and retirees, PWBM's analysis included doubling the number of legal immigrants per year and requiring all immigrants to obtain unsubsidized health insurance.  Overall, PWBM found that the policies included in the analysis would boost GDP by 21% over 30 years compared to current law and raise wages by nearly 7% in that period, compared to current law.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  Private health insurance premiums would fall by 27% over 30 years, relative to current law, due to the requirement that immigrants obtain private health insurance reducing moral hazard, and expanding the insurance pool with younger, healthier individuals.  The federal debt held by the public, which is currently 99% of U.S. GDP and is projected to rise to 166% of GDP by 2054, would be 37.8% lower than the projection in 2054 under the PWBM analysis."

Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 along with company CEO Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman and others, split from the company in early 2018 after failing to secure control over the company as its majority shareholder and CEO and later attempting to convince its founders to merge it with Tesla. Musk founded xAI, a competitor to OpenAI, in March 2023.  In March 2024, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI that argued it breached its founding mission as a not-for-profit company by creating a for-profit structure. OpenAI has pushed back on that lawsuit, which was withdrawn and refiled over the summer, and outlined Musk's past agreement with a for-profit structure in a new blog post and legal filing.  OpenAI noted that in email conversations with other co-founders, Elon Musk questioned whether there should be a nonprofit structure before the company was announced in November 2015 and wrote in an email that the ""structure doesn't seem optimal … Probably better to have a standard C corp with a parallel nonprofit.""  ELON MUSK SUES OPENAI, SAM ALTMAN AGAIN  In July 2017, Musk and the OpenAI founders were discussing the company's next steps and a message from Brockman to Zilis, who was acting as a liaison between Musk and OpenAI, detailing notes from a meeting with Musk in which they discussed OpenAI potentially changing the structure to for-profit.  Brockman said in the message the meeting with Musk ""turned into talking about structure (he said non-profit was def the right one early on, may not be the right one now – ilya and I agree with this for a number of reasons).""  Progress made in advancing OpenAI's technology in August 2017 prompted Musk to suggest that it was ""time to make the next step for OpenAI. This is the triggering event."" It was a reference to an email from Brockman that suggested an OpenAI for-profit would launch in 2018.  ELON MUSK DROPS LAWSUIT AGAINST OPENAI  FOX Business learned from OpenAI's legal team that Musk then instructed his wealth manager in September 2017 to create a public benefit corporation called Open Artificial Intelligence Technologies Inc., which spurred negotiations about ownership terms.  Musk insisted on having majority equity and board control and serving as CEO. When the other co-founders declined those terms, Musk said discussions were over.  In January 2018, Musk said, ""OpenAI is on a path of certain failure relative to Google,"" and he suggested the company be acquired by Tesla. However, the OpenAI team opted against doing so, and the two sides were unable to agree on a path forward.  OPENAI PUSHES BACK ON ELON MUSK LAWSUIT, SAYS HE SUGGESTED MERGER WITH TESLA  Musk resigned from the company's board in February 2018 after hosting a goodbye meeting, saying he would pursue AI development at Tesla. He also told OpenAI it needed to raise ""billions per year immediately"" in December 2018 or else it had no chance of being relevant in the AI race with Google's DeepMind unit.  OpenAI publicly launched its capped-profit entity, which is governed by the nonprofit, in March 2019. The company shared an advance copy of the announcement with Musk, who replied, ""Please be explicit that I have no financial interest in the for-profit arm of OpenAI.""  The company's founders also offered Musk equity in the capped-profit entity multiple times over the years, which Musk has declined.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  OpenAI emerged as a leader in the development of generative AI with its launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. It has since secured significant investment from Microsoft and other entities.  XAI has raised billions of dollars since its launch early in 2023 and has launched AI models that aim to compete with ChatGPT.  Musk withdrew his initial lawsuit against OpenAI from March 2024 in June but filed a new complaint in August."

If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).  Two Texas parents filed a lawsuit this week against the makers of Character.AI, claiming the artificial intelligence chatbot is a ""clear and present danger to minors,"" with one plaintiff alleging it encouraged their teen to kill his parents.  According to the complaint, Character.AI ""abused and manipulated"" an 11-year-old girl, introducing and exposing her ""consistently to hypersexualized interactions that were not age appropriate, causing her to develop sexualized behaviors prematurely and without [her parent's] awareness.""  The complaint also accuses the chatbot of causing a 17-year-old boy to mutilate himself, and, among other things, sexually exploiting and abusing him while alienating the minor from his parents and church community.  UNITEDHEALTHCARE ACCUSED OF RELYING ON AI ALGORITHMS TO DENY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE CLAIMS  In response to the teen complaining that his parents were limiting his online activity, the bot allegedly wrote, according to a screenshot in the filing, ""You know sometimes I'm not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like ‘child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse.' I just have no hope for your parents.'""  CHARLES PAYNE: GOOGLE JUST SENT SHOCKWAVES ACROSS THE COMPUTING WORLD  The parents are suing Character.AI creator Character Technologies, along with co-founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, as well as Google and parent company Alphabet, over reports that Google invested some $3 billion in Character.

We are always working toward achieving that balance, as are many companies using AI across the industry.""  ""As part of this, we are creating a fundamentally different experience for teen users from what is available to adults,"" the statement continued. ""This includes a model specifically for teens that reduces the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content while preserving their ability to use the platform.""  GAMING PLATFORM ROBLOX TIGHTENS MESSAGING RULES FOR USERS UNDER 13  The Character spokesperson added that the platform is ""introducing new safety features for users under 18 in addition to the tools already in place that restrict the model and filter the content provided to the user.""  Google's naming in the lawsuit follows a report by The Wall Street Journal in September claiming the tech giant paid $2.7 billion to license Character's technology and rehire its co-founder, Noam Shazeer, who the article claims left Google in 2021 to start his own company after Google refused to launch a chatbot he developed.  ""Google and Character AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies, nor have we used them in our products,"" Google spokesperson José Castañeda told FOX Business in a statement when asked for comment on the lawsuit.  ""User safety is a top concern for us, which is why we’ve taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes,"" Castañeda added.  OPENAI RELEASES TEXT-TO-VIDEO AI MODEL SORA TO CERTAIN CHATGPT USERS  But this week's lawsuit raises further scrutiny about the safety of Character.AI, after Character Technologies was sued in September by a mother who claims the chatbot caused the suicide of her 14-year-old son.  The mother, Megan Garcia, says Character.AI targeted her son, Sewell Setzer, with ""anthropomorphic, hypersexualized, and frighteningly realistic experiences"".  Setzer began having conversations with various chatbots on Character.AI starting in April 2023, according to the lawsuit. The conversations were often text-based romantic and sexual interactions.  Setzer expressed thoughts of suicide and the chatbot repeatedly brought it up, according to the complaint. Setzer eventually died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in February after the company’s chatbot allegedly repeatedly encouraged him to do so.  ""We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of one of our users and want to express our deepest condolences to the family,"" Character Technologies said in a statement at the time.  Character.AI has since added a self-harm resource to its platform and new safety measures for users under the age of 18.  Character Technologies told CBS News that users are able to edit the bot's responses and that Setzer did in some of the messages.  ""Our investigation confirmed that, in a number of instances, the user rewrote the responses of the Character to make them explicit. In short, the most sexually graphic responses were not originated by the Character, and were instead written by the user,"" Jerry Ruoti, head of trust and safety at Character.AI told the outlet.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  Moving forward, Character.AI said the new safety features will include pop-ups with disclaimers that AI is not a real person and directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline when suicidal ideations are brought up.

https://www.foxbusiness.com/real-estate/heres-how-you-can-earn-points-when-purchasing-home,Fox News,right,Business,Here's how you can earn points when purchasing a home,"Bilt, a company known for helping renters earn rewards on their biggest reoccurring expense, is expanding its loyalty program. This time, it is turning its attention to homeownership.  The company is launching a program that allows people to earn points when purchasing a home. The company said it is a first for the industry. It also comes at a time when housing costs, including elevated home prices and borrowing rates, have sidelined a significant number of buyers and sellers from the market.  Industry experts have also warned that interest rates may not fall as much as previously expected.  The new program is an extension of what the company has already been doing in attempting to help its members build their path toward homeownership. Bilt currently helps members build their credit by reporting their timely rent payments to the credit bureaus every month. In doing so, renters are able to build their credit history, making it easier to qualify for a home, founder Ankur Jain told FOX Business.  BOZEMAN, MONTANA HOME TO A BOOMING REAL ESTATE MARKET  With the new program, Bilt launched a search tool on its website and app that enables prospective buyers to search for homes based on their monthly budget rather than the total price. The move is an attempt to help buyers navigate the complexities of homeownership in a way that aligns with their budget.  ""Part of the issue is people really don't even know what they can afford and which homes they can buy,"" Jain said. ""It is a little bit easier to find homes you can afford right now just by creating simplicity and transparency.""  Here's how the program works:  First, perspective buyers need to be a Bilt member, which is free. Bilt members can then search for homes based on their budget through the company's website or app. Buyers can search and compare what they can get for their monthly budget in areas around the country.  Members can also see how far their monthly rental payment could go toward owning a home.  THIS IS THE BEST TIME TO BUY A HOME ACCORDING TO EXPERTS  ""You say, ‘I can spend $5,000 a month all in, including taxes, insurance, interest, principal… show me the homes I can buy today.’ And we do all the work for you,"" Jain said.  The company calculates homeownership costs such as the local tax rates on that house, insurance estimates, principal cost and interest. It also looks up what mortgage rates a person qualifies for, according to Jain.  When someone is ready to buy, they click on the home and schedule a tour with an eXp Realty agent. If the prospective buyer closes on the home with the agent, they will earn one point for every $2 of a home's purchase price.  The points will automatically get deposited into their Bilt account, which can be redeemed for things like travel or fitness classes.  These homes are not direct listings for Bilt. The company is pulling from all the major home services.  ""It's just going through the Bilt to find the home, that's the key,"" Jain said.  Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told FOX Business he is unsure if a ""corporate point system can influence the ultimate decision one way or the other"" to buy a home given how big this decision is.  However, Yun acknowledged that Bilt's move is a positive development for the industry.  ""Many inducements exist in the marketplace, for example, buying down of mortgage rates, free appliances, free home warranties, and others,"" he said. ""Therefore, more competition is admirable to see in this country’s competitive real estate brokerage industry.""  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  Bilt has been expanding its rewards programs since being founded in 2019 by Jain.  Today, Bilt members can earn points on rent payments at more than 4.5 million homes across the nation. Among its housing incentives, it also rewards members when they sign or renew a lease. Those points can be transferred for things like travel, dining or fitness classes. It also rewards people for spending within their neighborhood, such as at local restaurants, workout classes and for using Lyft's rideshare service.  In August, it teamed up with Walgreens to help members use their unused flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts funds for eligible purchases."

She also said luxury homes in Bozeman have been one of the strongest markets in the area.  Meanwhile, the condo market ""has been lagging"" some and ""anything sub-jumbo rate has taken a back seat,"" she explained.

""Bozeman is a thriving small community, but we’ve got great restaurants, we’ve got entertainment, and so we’re seeing people who own homes in Big Sky then want to purchase a home, like a condo downtown, so that they don’t have to drive the canyon at night after they’ve had dinner and possibly a glass of wine.""  ""We’re seeing second homes as a result in Bozeman, but I also think that it’s putting Bozeman on the map.""

The area offers an abundance of outdoor recreational activities such as hiking, skiing, biking and fishing. Other aspects like its safety, expanding airport, schools and health care have also drawn people to Bozeman, per Vance.

Bozeman’s population jumped nearly 43% between 2010 and 2020, according to the Census Bureau. It also posted a 7% increase from April 2020 to July 2023.

https://www.foxbusiness.com/real-estate/best-time-buy-home-according-experts,Fox News,right,Business,This is the best time to buy a home according to experts,"A major misconception in the U.S. real estate market is that the spring is the best time to buy a home. In reality, spring benefits sellers.  ""Most homebuyers think spring is the best time to buy because we all call it the spring buying season. But if you actually look at housing market metrics, the fall overwhelmingly is a much more favorable time for buyers to get their foot in the door in the housing market,"" Ralph McLaughlin, Realtor.com senior economist, told FOX Business.  Nationally, Realtor.com economists estimate that the best time to buy a home is from the last week of September to the first week of October. However, McLaughlin noted that you don't have to ""hit that peak week perfectly."" Any time during fall will be better for buyers compared to the spring, he said.  He pointed to several factors why buyers should aim for the fall, notably the supply and demand imbalance that tends to happen towards the end of the year plays in a buyers' favor.  EXISTING HOME SALES FALL TO LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 2010  There are more homes on the market relative to buyers as many people return to the school season. According to McLaughlin, buyers with school-aged children typically avoid moving during this time or have already relocated earlier in the year.  WHY MORTGAGE RATES ARE GOING UP DESPITE THE FED'S INTEREST RATE CUT  You also have a number of homes that didn't sell earlier in the year but are still on the market. There could be several factors contributing to this, such as a seller listing their home later than intended or pricing it too high.  As fall approaches, McLaughlin said certain sellers will start to ""get a little bit nervous,"" increasing their ""willingness to cut prices."" This, in turn, leads to a larger share of homes on the market with price reductions.  Homes are also staying on the market longer, which means buyers don’t have to rush. Unlike the height of the pandemic, when homes were quickly snapped up, buyers today aren’t as pressured to settle or close on a property immediately, he said.  ""I know that was the trend during the pandemic years when homes were closing in a week to two weeks when it was a slow year. That's changed,"" McLaughlin said.  Today, the typical home spends between two and three months on the market, according to McLaughlin, adding that buyers should use this time to their advantage.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  While interest rates still might be high, price cuts signal flexibility, which means buyers have the opportunity to negotiate, according to McLaughlin.  ""You can leverage the abundance of homes that are on the market to your advantage and in potentially getting a price cut or getting other concessions,"" he said.  This could include things such as negotiating a rate buydown, which is an arrangement in which a buyer gets a lower mortgage interest rate in exchange for an upfront fee."

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-rookie-xavier-worthy-calls-dream-come-true-having-patrick-mahomes-his-quarterback,Fox News,right,Japan,Chiefs rookie Xavier Worthy calls it 'dream come true' having Patrick Mahomes as his quarterback,"Every rookie entering the NFL wishes to make an immediate impact on their team, especially first-round picks who carry loads of expectation when they hear their names called by Commissioner Roger Goodell on Draft night.  After breaking the 40-yard dash record at the NFL Scouting Combine, Xavier Worthy raised his draft stock, entering that zone of being a potential first-round pick.  All offseason, the Kansas City Chiefs were among teams looking for another playmaker to work with Patrick Mahomes on offense. With the 28th overall pick in hand, Worthy was still available, and they wasted no time adding his speed to the roster.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  While being over the moon that he was selected in the first round, Worthy quickly realized he had a two-time MVP, three-time Super Bowl champion and six-time Pro Bowl quarterback that would be throwing him the football.  One can guess how he feels about that after 13 games and a 12-1 record.  ""It’s kinda like a dream come true,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital ahead of Week 15.  CHIEFS ROOKIE XAVIER WORTHY SAYS TEAM THRIVES PLAYING IN VILLAIN ROLE: ‘EVERYBODY JUST WANTS US TO LOSE’  Worthy understood there was no time to geek out over Mahomes being his new signal caller. It was time to get to work, and he quickly realized that all the winning that comes with being a Chief is business at the end of the day.  ""You see why they win when you’re here,"" Worthy explained. ""They work hard, they go about their business the right way. They have the slogan called ‘The Formula’ – I feel like Coach Reid has hit [on] that in an interview. They really go about that every day, and I feel like it says a lot about the program.""  Of course, Worthy was not guaranteed to slot right in and get working with Mahomes immediately. First, he had to learn the playbook and then develop chemistry with his new quarterback on the practice field and in games.  Well, his first touch of his career, Worthy took an end-around flip from Mahomes to the house for a 21-yard rushing touchdown against the Baltimore Ravens.  Since then, Worthy has totaled 38 receptions on 67 targets for 448 yards with four touchdowns through the air, as well as 54 rushing yards and two touchdowns on the ground.  He feels the trust a quarterback needs in his receiver is there, leading to some pretty good first-year numbers.  ""Pat, he’s more of a guy that’s like, if you show you can go out there and do it, and he trusts you, and you earn his trust, he’s going to trust you throughout the season,"" Worthy said about Mahomes. ""I feel like I’ve earned his trust, and I feel like we’ve got something good rolling.""  A prime example of that came in the latest close-game victory for the Chiefs, which required Mahomes to orchestrate another game-winning drive.  On fourth-and-6 with the game on the line, Mahomes was scrambling around the pocket as the Los Angeles Chargers' pass rush was barreling through his offensive line, looking for a receiver to give him a chance to extend the drive.  Mahomes could have looked to Travis Kelce, DeAndre Hopkins or other veteran options if he wished. However, knowing where Worthy was going to be, he released the ball just as he turned around to look at his quarterback. Worthy ran back to the ball, secured it and kept the team's chances of winning alive.  Job well done, even if there was some pain involved.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play. I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video,"" Worthy said. ""But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  The stacked wins have resulted in what every rookie wants: playoff football.  Worthy gets that as the Chiefs secured the AFC West title for the ninth straight season after beating the Chargers, and the rookie is excited to continue developing that relationship with Mahomes to hopefully help their case for a third straight Super Bowl victory.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.

""It was fun,"" he said of the experience. ""It was always something I wanted to do just to give back to the community where I’m at, and it was just fun to see the reactions on the kids’ faces. It brightened my day."""

The lawsuit accused Jay-Z and Diddy of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000, Fox News Digital previously confirmed. Before Jay-Z was named, the rapper received a demand letter likely in an attempt to settle.  ""Things have escalated,"" Orange County criminal defense lawyer Lauren Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital, as the back-and-forth between Jay-Z's legal team and Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee now plays out in the public eye.  JAY-Z'S ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT: CAN RAP MOGUL FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES?  Fox News Digital looks back at the timeline leading to Jay-Z being named in the bombshell lawsuit:  Diddy accused of raping 13-year-old girl  Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was first accused of raping a 13-year-old while celebrities watched in October. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York on Oct. 20 by Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee on behalf of a Jane Doe.  The unidentified woman ended up at a VMAs afterparty after attempting to gain entry to the awards show at Radio City Music Hall, according to court documents.  ""One of the limousine drivers she spoke to claimed to work for [Diddy],"" the lawsuit read. ""He told her that Combs liked younger girls and said she ‘fit what Diddy was looking for,’ not allowing her into the Awards, but inviting her to an afterparty.""  The girl claimed after being given one drink, she found a room to lie down in because she became ""woozy and lightheaded."" At one point, Combs and two unidentified celebrities entered the room. ""Celebrity A"" allegedly raped the 13-year-old while Combs and ""Celebrity B"" watched. Afterwards, the young girl claimed Combs raped her while ""Celebrity A"" and ""Celebrity B"" watched.  Diddy denied the allegations in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.  WATCH ON FOX NATION: WHAT DIDDY DO?  Jay-Z receives a demand letter regarding the sexual assault lawsuit against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs  At some point, Jay-Z received a demand letter from the anonymous accuser's lawyer – unbeknownst to the public. Jay-Z confirmed this information in his statement denying the rape accusation.  ""My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a ‘lawyer’ named Tony Buzbee ,"" Jay-Z shared in the statement on Roc Nation's social media. ""What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.  ""No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!""  ""Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes."" — Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot  The decision to eventually publicly name Jay-Z was likely due to ""a failure to settle the case,"" a legal expert told Fox News Digital.  ""Jay-Z may have decided that settling the case would suggest to the public that he was somehow involved in the sexual assault of a minor,"" Robert DeGroot, founding Partner of the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot, explained. ""After receiving a demand letter, Jay-Z and his legal team probably pushed back against the Plaintiff's accusations and may have tried to convince her counsel to not proceed with naming him as a Defendant.  ""The Plaintiff's attorney probably made a decision to proceed against Jay-Z after it became apparent that they would not settle the case. Each side engages in a metaphoric game of chicken to see who can push the boundary further, in an attempt to get the opposite side to bend to their wishes.""  Jay-Z files lawsuit claiming extortion under ‘John Doe’  Before Jay-Z was named publicly in the lawsuit accusing him and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of rape, he sued his accuser's lawyer as a celebrity John Doe.  WATCH: JAY-Z ISSUES SCATHING DENIAL TO ALLEGATIONS HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL  On Nov. 18, his lawyers filed a lawsuit against Buzbee. Since then, Jay-Z confirmed he was the plaintiff in the anonymous lawsuit.  ""Plaintiff presently faces a gun to his head,"" the court document, obtained by Fox News Digital, read. Jay-Z's team claimed Buzbee and the anonymous accuser had demanded the rapper ""either repeatedly pay an exorbitant sum of money to stop Defendants from the wide publication of wildly false allegations of sexual assault that would subject [Jay-Z] to opprobrium and irreparably harm [Jay-Z's] reputation, family, career and livelihood, or else face the threat of an untold number of civil suits and financial and personal ruin.""  While Jay-Z accused Buzbee of extortion, legal experts claimed demand letters are typical in these types of cases.  ""It is standard for these types of letters to be sent before filing a case or including a defendant in a case,"" Johnson-Norris told Fox News Digital. ""If a case can settle outside of court, that usually benefits everyone involved. It is not extortion, but it can feel like it to the defendant, especially if the ask is high.""  DeGroot added: ""The tone of these letters may vary. Given the high profile nature of Jay-Z, and having a sense that it would be leaked to the press, Mr. Buzbee is starting his litigation spin as early as possible to get the attention of Jay-Z and to influence potential jurors.""  LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  Jay-Z named in sexual assault lawsuit against Diddy  Jay-Z was added to Jane Doe's lawsuit against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs on Dec. 8. The amended complaint, also filed by Tony Buzbee, named the rap mogul as ""Celebrity A.""  In the new version of the lawsuit, the 13-year-old became disoriented and found a bedroom to rest in after allegedly consuming one drink. Jay-Z, Diddy and female ""Celebrity B"" seemingly followed the girl into the room. She ""immediately recognized all three celebrities,"" according to the court document.  Jay-Z allegedly raped the girl, followed by Diddy's alleged rape of the plaintiff, all while ""celebrity B"" watched, the court document stated.  The ""Empire State of Mind"" rapper denied the allegations in a statement shared on Roc Nation's social media.  ""These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!! Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree? These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case,"" he wrote, in part.  ""Celebrity B"" remains unnamed, but will likely be revealed at some point in the process, according to a legal expert.  ""Since that person's participation appears to be that of a witness, her status is entirely different, unless there is a legal reason,"" DeGroot told Fox News Digital. ""It certainly appears that the celebrity would not want to be tarred with the same brush as Jay-Z and P. Diddy. Unless there is a protective order, her identity will in all likelihood be revealed during the discovery process.""  ""Celebrity B"" is ""undoubtedly"" in communication with Buzbee through a lawyer, Johnson-Norris noted.

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bill-belichick-said-he-always-wanted-coach-college-after-taking-unc-job-dream-come-true,Fox News,right,Japan,Bill Belichick said he always wanted to coach in college after taking UNC job: 'Dream come true',"From rumors, to a finalized deal, to a press conference, the last 24 hours for the North Carolina Tar Heels have been a whirlwind as legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick will now lead a college football program for the first time in his illustrious career.  Belichick sat in front of the media during his introductory press conference as the new head coach for the Tar Heels – an idea no college football fan would've fathomed until rumors began to swirl last week about his interest in running the program.  It was always thought that Belichick, who is 27 wins away from becoming the head coach with the most victories in NFL history, would return to the pros if he wished to continue coaching.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  But the 72-year-old explained on Thursday afternoon why he chose to go the college route.  ""​​I’ve always wanted to coach in college football,"" Belichick said. ""It just never really worked out. Had some good years in the NFL, so that was OK. But this is really a dream come true.""  BILL BELICHICK AGREES TO BECOME UNC'S NEXT HEAD FOOTBALL COACH  Belichick is obviously being modest by saying his time in the NFL was just ""good.""  Before the Kansas City Chiefs, he developed the New England Patriots into a dynasty, winning six Super Bowls and racking up wins that brought about the argument of greatest NFL head coach of all time.  College football, though, is a completely different beast, especially in this new NIL world. But these aren't waters Belichick just wants to dip his toes in – he's diving straight in and not looking to get out.  ""I didn't come here to leave,"" he said, dispelling thoughts for now that he's just trying to coach again before that next NFL opportunity opens up.  Belichick did say that, while the process may be different, the pros and college do have ""a lot of parallels."" It's why Michael Lombardi is coming in as the team's general manager, someone who knows how Belichick functions given their time together in New England.  ""I think that's the reason for the general structure with Michael as the general manager and myself as the coach and working collaboratively as we have done in a professional structure,"" Belichick explained.  For this big leap to be successful, Belichick knows he just needs to take things one day at a time. That starts with putting together his coaching staff, which he has already touched on with Freddie Kitchens coming aboard. More announcements should be made in the coming weeks.  Recruiting, not drafting, will also be interesting to watch with Belichick, but reports have indicated his wish for UNC to have the proper NIL resources to land top talent to make the program competitive.  As someone who was around the program as a kid – his father, Steve Belichick, coached with the Tar Heels in the 1950s – he understands what it means to be successful in Chapel Hill.

How could he not be happy when he is 12-1 to start off his first season in the NFL. Not many rookies get that luxury.  However, the first-round pick learned quickly what comes with the territory of being a team in search of three Super Bowls – playing the villain role.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Worthy, who broke the NFL Scouting Combine 40-yard dash record back in April, said he hears the outside noise, especially those wanting the Chiefs to lose each week.  ""I feel like everybody just wants us to lose,"" Worthy told Fox News Digital after highlighting the fun he had with the DICKS Holiday Shopping Sprint to impact kids in the Kansas City area for the holidays.  CHIEFS' ALTERNATE REALITY: KANSAS CITY WOULD BE 2011 IF THEIR ONE-SCORE GAME RESULTS WERE FLIPPED IN 2024  ""Every week, it’s a new excuse. First, the goal post is helping us. Then, it’s the refs helping us. I mean, we can’t get a break. But it’s cool to have that. It shows that everybody wants us to lose, we have a target on our backs, and we have to continue working each and every week.""  The Chiefs are a dynasty, and Worthy entered the fray right after they defeated the San Francisco 49ers in overtime to collect back-to-back Vince Lombardi trophies.  Just ask any other dynasty in the NFL what happens when they are on top. Fans will raise them up and ultimately want to watch them fall with a new winner crowned.  However, Worthy brings up a reason why some fans cannot stand to watch the Chiefs stack wins. They have been in so many close games this season, but they have maintained their winning streak in those one-score bouts.  For the last 15 games that have been determined by one score, the Chiefs have come out victorious. Yes, the goal post was involved this past week as Matthew Wright doinked it off the left side, but it went through to beat the Los Angeles Chargers. Additionally, there have been some controversial calls that have gone the Chiefs' way in the end.  Being the villain, though, is not something the Chiefs care about. They embrace it, and Worthy is just getting a taste of what Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and other veterans on the team have been feeling since last season.  ""It fuels us,"" Worthy explained. ""A lot of people say it’s hate, like, ‘Oh, people are always going against us.’ But how we look at it, the world’s watching us. You have all these eyes – you make the best of the opportunity with all these eyes on you.""  Worthy is no stranger to having a target on his back after playing for a large college program like the Texas Longhorns.  CHIEFS ARE KINGS OF CLOSING OUT GAMES, AND WHAT ELSE WE LEARNED IN WEEK 14  However, he touched on the senior leadership that helps guide the pact, especially Mahomes, who he continues to build a rapport with each week.  The proof is in the game tape, as Mahomes, scrambling on fourth-and-6 to continue the team's game-winning drive, threw a pass to Worthy with the game on the line, and he came back to the ball, secured it and kept the drive alive.  He even injured himself on the play, but his quarterback trusted him with the game on the line. A little pain is worth it in that case.  ""I actually dislocated my finger on that same play,"" he said. ""I popped it back in right after that – you can see it in the video. But, it’s huge to be able to have that trust from my quarterback in the NFL. I feel like everybody talks about being that guy in the NFL, so just to be able to build that trust and stack days with your quarterback is huge.""  With four games remaining and the AFC West title locked up for the ninth straight season, Worthy knows he will also be a rookie that enjoys playoff football at the end of the regular season.  He is also well aware that the target will be even larger with the Chiefs looking to become the first team ever to win three straight Super Bowls.  If Kansas City has to be the villain to do so, then that is perfectly fine for Worthy, who is solely focused on being the team's hero when it is his turn to make a play.  IMPACTING YOUTH IN KC WITH DICKS  While Worthy has the pleasure of gracing a field with Mahomes, Kelce and so many other Chiefs legends, he also gets to impact the Kansas City community just like them, too.

https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bill-belichick-unc-head-football-coach,Fox News,right,Japan,Bill Belichick agrees to become UNC's next head football coach,"Look out Chapel Hill, Bill Belichick is coming.  Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels finalized a deal for the 72-year-old to become their next head football coach, the university officially announced on Wednesday night.  ""I am excited for the opportunity at UNC-Chapel Hill. I grew up around college football with my Dad and treasured those times,"" Belichick wrote in a statement. ""I have always wanted to coach in college and now I look forward to building the football program in Chapel Hill.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  OutKick's Trey Wallace reports that UNC will give Belichick a five-year deal worth upwards of $50 million.  The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach remained interested in returning to the sidelines at some point in the future, but it was always expected that he would make his way back to the NFL after missing out on a new gig following his departure from the New England Patriots before this season. After all, Belichick had been in the league in some role since 1975 prior to this season.  But earlier this week, The Guardian US reported that Belichick agreed to become the new head coach in Chapel Hill, adding that Belichick handed the school a 400 page ""organizational bible"" with structure, payment plans, staffing choices etc.  Wallace reports one of the biggest components to the deal was Belichick having enough NIL money to compete in the recruiting space, which was agreed to. He also wanted to pick his assistant coaches, and UNC is giving them the resources to get who he wants, even if buyouts are necessary.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Among those assistants expected to join the staff is Stephen Belichick, his son who serves as Washington's defensive coordinator. It was reported that the elder Belichick had the unusual request of wanting his son to become his successor, stepping in when he decides to leave the program.  This will mark Belichick's first stint as a college football coach. His father, Steve Belichick, was a longtime assistant coach at Navy. But he did have a stint in the 1950s with the Tar Heels.  Belichick has spent much of the ongoing NFL season in the media spotlight after his interviews for NFL jobs didn't lead to a job offer.  While he interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons in January, the franchise opted against extending an offer. Belichick did not appear to draw much interest from any other NFL team, but his regular appearances on ESPN's ""ManningCast"" and the CW's ""Inside the NFL"" have kept him close to football.  During an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" earlier this week, Belichick confirmed he had talks with UNC about their head coaching vacancy, adding that he spent the 11 months since his departure from the Patriots taking a ""longer look"" at college football throughout the season as opposed to during the spring lead-up to the draft as a pro coach.  ""So it’s been, it’s been a good year for me. I’ve learned a lot,"" Belichick said. ""So, I’ve had the opportunity to talk to Chancellor [Lee] Roberts, and we’ve had a couple of good conversations. So we’ll see how it goes.""  Belichick opted not to go into more detail when asked by McAfee. Instead, Belichick offered a quip about his reputation for giving terse responses during news conferences with the Patriots.  ""Yeah, let’s just leave it at that, Pat,"" Belichick said with a grin. ""I mean, I don’t want to give out too much information. I want to get my press conference aura back.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Belichick shared some details about the makeup of a college program if he were a head coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" he said. ""It would be a professional program — training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history. He finished the 2023 season with 333 career wins — which places him in second on the all-time coaches wins list. Don Shula's 347 wins still leads all coaches."
https://www.foxnews.com/sports/unc-on-board-have-bill-belichick-become-next-head-coach-still-working-out-issues-deal-report,Fox News,right,Japan,"UNC 'on board' to have Bill Belichick become next head coach, still working out issues with deal","Bill Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels are working to close a deal to make him their next head football coach, which would be his first-ever time coaching in college.  However, ESPN reported that ""there are still issues that both sides need to work through.""  The report adds that the ""ball is in Belichick’s court"" as UNC officials are indeed on board with him taking over the program. And there is expected to be a ""resolution"" soon.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  In fact, OutKick's Trey Wallace reports it's come down to just NIL money, which was among the issues that needed to be worked out in the negotiations. If that can be agreed to, an emergency trustee meeting would be called to finalize the deal.  What exactly are the other issues? Well, the potential role of Belichick’s son, Washington Huskies defensive coordinator Stephen Belichick, is one of them.  It was reported by The Guardian that, among the elder Belichick’s stipulations, his son would be named his heir to the head coach role once the 72-year-old moves on, whenever that would be.  ESPN added Belichick’s salary for taking over and more need to be ironed out before a deal can be agreed to.  TOM BRADY EXPLAINS WHY HIS ANSWER IS ‘NO’ TO BILL BELICHICK HEADING TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL  It came as a shock when Belichick’s name was floated for the Tar Heels' vacant position after longtime head coach Mack Brown said he wouldn’t return after this season.  Some of Belichick’s ex-pupils, like Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, had some fun on FOX NFL Sunday this past week mimicking their old coach trying to deal with recruiting in this NIL age of college sports.  ""There’s a lot of things he can do, and obviously he’s tremendous, and even showing his personality. But getting out there on the recruiting trail and dealing with all these college kids,"" Brady said on the NFL pregame show. ""’Listen, do you really want to come here?’"" Brady said, acting as Belichick. ""’I mean, we don’t really want you anyway, but I guess you could come, we’ll figure out if you play.’""  But this wasn’t just a publicity stunt. There’s more than just mutual interest in Belichick’s return to coaching in Chapel Hill.  ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Belichick and UNC officials spent five hours discussing a potential deal on Sunday, and in typical Belichick fashion, he wouldn’t divulge any details during his weekly spot on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Monday morning.  He admitted having a ""couple of good conversations"" with Lee Roberts, UNC’s chancellor, and added, ""We’ll see how that goes.""  If a deal goes through, it would be one of the most polarizing head coach hires for a college program in history, as Belichick has only ever been a head coach in the NFL, where he won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots.  FORMER NFL COACH BRUCE ARIANS OFFERS ADVICE TO BILL BELICHICK AS NORTH CAROLINA FOOTBALL COACHING RUMORS SWIRL  His time with the franchise came to an end before this 2024 season. They mutually parted ways and Belichick’s attempts at finding another role elsewhere were all for naught. He has since joined the sports media space, offering his insight to various outlets, including ESPN, but being open to another opportunity in football was always in the cards.  However, it was always expected that such an opportunity would come from the NFL, and there are several head coaching roles already open in the league, making this situation even more surprising.  But Belichick told McAfee and his crew what would happen if he were to become a college football coach.  ""If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,"" Belichick said. ""It would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching and techniques that would transfer to the NFL.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Simply put, Belichick would bring to college football the system he knows works in the NFL, aiming for good players to join his team who will one day turn pro with the tools necessary for easy acclimation.  Time will tell if that program will be at UNC, but it appears some boxes need to be checked before a groundbreaking deal crosses the finish line.

The Boston Red Sox have landed Crochet in a blockbuster trade with the Chicago White Sox.  Boston is sending prospect catcher Kyle Teel, outfielder Braden Montgomery, infielder Chase Meidroth and right-handed pitcher Wikelman Gonzalez to the White Sox in exchange for Crochet.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  The New York Mets, who already landed Juan Soto on a record-breaking $765 million deal, were reportedly also in the running for Crochet's services next season. The Red Sox, a team with a deep farm system, unloaded four top-15 prospects to get the deal done, per MLB Pipeline.  What the Red Sox get in return is a budding star in their rotation, which needed a stud from the left side. Crochet is also under cheap team control for two years before becoming a free agent in 2027.  YANKEES SIGN ACE PITCHER TO HISTORIC CONTRACT AFTER LOSING JUAN SOTO SWEEPSTAKES: REPORTS  The White Sox made all the wrong MLB history last season with the worst record ever in a single year, but Crochet was a lone bright spot on the roster.  In his first All-Star season, Crochet pitched to a 3.58 ERA over 146 innings with 209 strikeouts and 33 walks.  His swing-and-miss stuff is what the Red Sox hope can be delivered at Fenway Park and beyond this season as a top-line rotation piece.  After the New York Yankees landed Max Fried, another reported Red Sox target in free agency, on an eight-year deal, Boston GM Craig Breslow quickly pivoted to Crochet to make sure they got a key piece for 2025 and beyond.  The Red Sox are not expected to be done, however. They were in on the Soto sweepstakes while also checking in on other position players as they hope to build a team worthy of reaching the postseason.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As for the White Sox, their rebuild continues, and top prospects like the ones they got in this deal are what’s needed to make that work in the long run.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkey-seeks-seeks-purge-pro-us-kurdish-force-helped-defeat-islamic-state-syria,Fox News,right,Japan,Turkey seeks to purge pro-US Kurdish force that helped defeat Islamic State in Syria,"JERUSALEM — Just hours after meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and discussing the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, Turkey's foreign minister sent a shocking message to Washington by saying his country's goal is to eliminate the main fighting force of the Syrian Kurds, which defeated ISIS in tandem with the U.S..  According to Turkish media, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said in a live broadcast on NTV that ""the elimination of YPG is [Turkey's] strategic goal."" He also noted the country's Kurds must be protected.  Asked about Fidan's comments, the State Department referred Fox News Digital to comments made earlier on Friday after Blinken's meeting with Fidan in Turkey.  The statement said, in part, ""Secretary Blinken emphasized the importance of U.S.-Turkish cooperation in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS mission in Syria.""  SYRIAN DICTATOR BASHAR ASSAD FLEES INTO EXILE AS ISLAMIST REBELS CONQUER COUNTRY  The U.S. has a long-standing military alliance with the Syrian Kurdish military organization, The People’s Defense Units (YPG), in Syria. The YPG is part of a broader organization known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and played a key role in dismantling the Islamic State in Syria.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has seized on the collapse of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s rule to gobble up territory controlled by the pro-American Syrian Kurds, risking hard-won gains against the Islamist State terrorist movement.  Erdoğan's campaign to purge the SDF in northern Syria has created a dangerous security situation in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS), according to Gen. Mazloum Abdi, the SDF’s commander in chief.  In an exclusive interview Thursday, Mazloum told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin, ""We are still under constant attack from the Turkish military and the Turkish-supported opposition, which is called SNA. Eighty drone attacks a day we have from the Turkish military. There is intensive artillery shells. This situation has paralyzed our counterterror operation.""  Islamic State prisoners held in SDF-run detention camps could escape amid the military offensive launched by pro-Turkish forces against the SDF. The SDF has redirected much of its force capability and resources to blunt an aggressive Turkish-backed military offensive.  In 2022, Fox News Digital reported that Erdoğan’s slated invasion of northern Syria could open the floodgates for the release of as many 10,000 Islamic State fighters.  The U.S. on Wednesday brokered a cease-fire between the pro-Turkey Syrian National Army (SNA), the Syrian opposition (TSO) and the SDF.  FALL OF SYRIA'S BASHAR ASSAD IS STRATEGIC BLOW TO IRAN AND RUSSIA, EXPERTS SAY  The U.S. has about 900 troops stationed in northeast Syria who coordinate with the SDF to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State after the new wave of Turkish attacks against the Syrian Kurds.  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., warned the Turks on X, posting, ""In the past I have drafted sanctions targeting Turkey if they engage in military operations against the Kurdish forces who helped President Trump destroy ISIS. I stand ready to do this again in a bipartisan way.  ""We should not allow the Kurdish forces — who helped us destroy ISIS on President Trump’s watch — to be threatened by Turkey or the radical Islamists who have taken over Syria.""  Fox News Digital attempted to contact various Turkish officials, including its embassy spokespeople in Washington and Tel Aviv and its United Nations mission in New York.  ""We have time and again pointed out threats against our national security, posed by the PKK/YPG terrorist network in Syria and Iraq,"" Turkish diplomats previously told Fox News Digital about the Kurdish military forces PKK and YPG. PKK is an abbreviation for the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an organization classified by the U.S. as a terrorist entity.  Efrat Aviv, a professor in the Department of General History at Bar-Ilan University in Israel and a leading expert on Turkey, told Fox News Digital, ""Turkey's actions in Syria further complicate the situation and hinder international efforts to bring about a comprehensive resolution to the conflict. The withdrawal of Turkish forces from the region and the cessation of conflicts with the Kurds could contribute to improving regional stability and efforts to end ISIS terrorism.  TURKEY'S INVASION THREATS SHOULD BE TAKEN 'VERY SERIOUSLY': CYPRUS OFFICIAL  ""Turkey's military actions in Syria jeopardize regional stability and undermine efforts to end ISIS terrorism. The Turkish strikes not only harm the Kurds, but also exacerbate the humanitarian situation in the region, causing significant population displacement.""  Uzay Bulut, a Turkish-born political analyst, told Fox News Digital, ""Erdoğan’s imperial ambition in Syria has not changed. Land grab and demographic change have always been Turkey's plan in Syria. Turkey's military campaigns against Syria have brought nothing but instability to the region and severe persecution of minorities.  ""To prevent further abuses, massacres or forced displacements against Christians, Kurds and Yazidis and to stop the spread of jihadism in the region, the Trump administration should get involved diplomatically to protect religious and ethnic minorities, particularly defenseless Christians, in Syria.""  Syria's Christian population could be as low as 2.5%, down from 10% before the civil war started in 2011. Christian and other ethnic and religious minorities face persecution from the radical Islamist Sunni terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its extremist allies.  ""The ongoing jihadist assault against Syrian Kurds and Christians is led by the al Qaeda offshoot, HTS,"" Bulut said. ""HTS forces are backed by the government of Turkey and have brutalized and displaced religious minority communities in Idlib since 2017. HTS aims to install Islamic rule in Syria.""  The Trump transition team did not respond to Fox News Digital press queries.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  When asked by Fox News Digital if the U.S. was contemplating sanctioning Turkey, a State Department spokesperson said, ""As a general matter, we do not preview sanctions.""  On his trip to the region Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met his Turkish counterpart, and the two discussed the latest developments in the area.  A readout of their meeting noted in part that Blinken ""reiterated calls for all actors in Syria to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Syrians, including members of minority groups, and to prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism."""
https://www.foxnews.com/world/south-korea-lawmakers-vote-impeach-president-over-martial-law-declaration,Fox News,right,Japan,South Korea lawmakers vote to impeach president over martial law declaration,"South Korean lawmakers on Saturday voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law declaration earlier this month.  The National Assembly passed the motion in a 204-85 vote on Saturday.  Saturday’s vote means that Yoon's presidential powers and duties have been suspended after the copies of a document on the impeachment were delivered to him and to the Constitutional Court. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will now assume the role of acting president.  The court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he's thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.  NORTH KOREA CONDEMNS SOUTH KOREA AS ‘FASCIST DICTATORSHIP’ AFTER MARTIAL LAW SCARE  Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung hailed the outcome of the vote, saying the motion's passage proved the people are the country's masters and marked the beginning of a new democracy, according to Yonhap News Agency.  Saturday marked lawmakers' second attempt to impeach the South Korean president. Yoon survived an impeachment vote last weekend after most lawmakers of the ruling People Power Party boycotted the floor vote.  Since then, some PPP lawmakers announced their intentions to vote for Yoon's impeachment in a second vote, as public protests against Yoon intensified and his approval rating plummeted.  Though lasting only six hours, Yoon's Dec. 3 martial law declaration – the first of its kind in more than four decades in South Korea – has thrown the East Asian nation into political turmoil, halting diplomatic activities and rattling financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it.  SOUTH KOREA'S FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER ATTEMPTED SUICIDE AFTER HE WAS ARRESTED OVER MARTIAL LAW PROBE  After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree before they withdrew after the parliament rejected it. No major violence occurred.  But in the days since, thousands of protesters have poured into the streets of the capital, Seoul, braving the bitter cold, calling for the president's ouster and arrest. Yoon's conservative supporters, meanwhile, have held counterprotests, denouncing attempts to impeach the president.  Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea, as law enforcement authorities are investigating whether he and others involved in the martial law declaration committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. If convicted, the leader of a rebellion plot can face the death penalty or life imprisonment.  Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution, but that doesn't extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Yoon's defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul's metropolitan police agency have been arrested over their roles in the martial law case. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations.  The Associated Press contributed to this report."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-freed-syrian-prison-assads-overthrow-taken-country-us-military,Fox News,right,Japan,American freed from Syrian prison after Assad's overthrow taken out of country by US military,"An American who was released this week after being held in a Syrian prison for seven months has been flown out of the country on a U.S. military helicopter, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Travis Timmerman, who was among thousands of prisoners freed by rebels who overthrew former President Bashar al-Assad over the weekend, said after his release that he had been on a Christian pilgrimage when he illegally crossed into the country seven months ago and was detained.  He told The Associated Press that, along with another Syrian man, the ""liberators"" freed him with around 70 women, some of whom were also being held with their children.  Timmerman said that he wasn’t treated badly while he was held in the infamous Syrian intelligence facility known as Palestine Branch.  TRUMP'S PLEDGE AGAINST ‘FOREVER WARS’ COULD BE TESTED WITH SYRIA IN HANDS OF JIHADIST FACTIONS  But he told the Al-Arabiya TV network that he could hear other men being tortured in the prison every day.  ""It was OK. I was fed. I was watered,"" said Timmerman. ""The one difficulty was that I couldn’t go to the bathroom when I wanted to. I was not beaten, and the guards treated me decently.""  He was allowed out of his cell three times a day to go to the bathroom.  After Assad’s overthrow, he said the rebels came to the prison and ""knocked the door down (of his cell) with a hammer.""  Timmerman was first seen in video that emerged online Thursday after rebels seized Damascus, the country’s capital.  SYRIA'S LIBERATED POLITICAL PRISONS REVEAL GRIM REALITY OF BASHAR ASSAD'S REGIME OF TORTURE  In the video, a bearded Timmerman was lying on a mattress under a blanket in what appeared to be a private house. A group of men in the video said he was being treated well and would be safely returned home, The Associated Press reported.  Palestine Branch, also known as Branch 235, houses nearly a dozen buildings hidden behind high concrete walls, according to The New York Times.  Human Rights Watch reported more than a decade ago that prisoners there were subjected to torture, including electrocutions and beatings.  ""The guards hung me by my wrists from the ceiling for eight days,"" a former prisoner told the organization in 2012. ""After a few days of hanging, being denied sleep, it felt like my brain stopped working. I was imagining things. My feet got swollen on the third day. I felt pain that I have never felt in my entire life. It was excruciating. I screamed that I needed to go to a hospital, but the guards just laughed at me.""  Many prisoners would also die of illnesses or starvation under the deplorable conditions.  At another notorious Syrian prison known as Sednaya, The Free Press, in collaboration with the Center for Peace Communications, also discovered testimonies of torture and executions while investigating it after the fall of Assad’s regime this week.  ""They would call out names at dawn, strip the prisoners of their clothes, and take them away,"" a former inmate told The Free Press. ""We knew from the sound of chains on the platforms that these were executions. Condemned prisoners wouldn’t be fed for three days prior. Once a month, they would search us. During one such search, an officer declared, ‘We’re not here to inspect; we’re here to kill.’""  Since the thousands of prisoners were released, loved ones have been searching for signs of those who went missing in the barbaric prisons.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/australian-jewish-community-alarmed-amid-rising-antisemitism-fear-anxiety,Fox News,right,Japan,Australia's Jewish community alarmed by rising antisemitism: 'Fear and anxiety',"A devastating arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue is now being investigated as a possible terror attack, drawing worldwide attention to a stark increase in antisemitism in Australia.  Masked vandals set the Adass Israel Synagogue aflame on Dec. 6, in one of several incidents that have left the Jewish community seeking support from government leaders.  On Wednesday, Sky News Australia reported a car was destroyed after being set on fire in a Jewish community in Sydney. At least two, but possibly as many as seven, buildings in the area were vandalized, with one graffiti tag reading ""kill Israiel"" (sic). This rash of hate followed in the wake of a similar incident late last month, when vehicles and a restaurant in the same area were covered with graffiti.  Following the attacks in Sydney, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told Sky News Australia, ""Sydney, per capita, has the second-highest number of Holocaust survivors in the world,"" explaining that they came ""to Australia specifically to be free from this kind of hate.""  JEWISH CHILDREN, TEENS VIOLENTLY ATTACKED IN LONDON: ‘STREETS ARE NO LONGER SAFE’  Worshiper Yumi Friedman told Avi Yemini of Rebel News that he was inside the synagogue when he heard banging on the door and saw glass flying. Friedman later said he smelled fire and burned his hand while attempting to open the synagogue door.  Friedman said that responding police told Jewish worshipers to get on the ground and show their hands. ""They came and arrested us,"" he said. ""It took them a while to realize that we’re Jewish and we didn’t do this.""  Zionism is not a feature of the Haredi Judaism that worshipers at the Adass Israel Synagogue practice. Yemini asked members of the community why they believed the non-Zionist synagogue was targeted. ""Jews are Jews,"" a man wearing a kippah replied. ""They’re anti-Jews,"" another visibly Jewish man told Yemini. ""Not anti-anything else.""  Yemini filmed a protester outside the firebombed synagogue wearing a keffiyeh and a baseball cap featuring the Palestinian flag who held a sign stating ""Nothing is more antisemitic than Zionism.""  Numerous community members interviewed by Yemini said they felt unsupported by the local government. ""People have been attacked here,"" one man reminded Victoria Police Detective Inspector Chris Murray, who was present to address the community. ""Why don’t you put someone in here?""  ""We’re doing our best,"" Murray responded.  Murray told crowds that police would ""do everything"" to ""bring these individuals before the courts."" Though they believed the attack was targeted, Murray said that ""what we don’t know is why.""  Shane Patton, Victoria police chief commissioner, told reporters at a press conference that the firebombing is being investigated as ""a likely terror attack.""  CALLS FOR US TO DO MORE AS ANTISEMITIC ATTACKS SKYROCKET IN EUROPE: ‘ENORMOUSLY PAINFUL’  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been lambasted for his response to the Melbourne attack, which a Sky News Australia host said was ""four days too late."" Yemini documented Albanese’s visit to the Adass Israel Synagogue. When the kippah-wearing prime minister failed to answer questions from assembled reporters, Yemini followed him to the car, telling Albanese that ""yesterday was the first time you didn’t conflate antisemitism and Islamophobia.""  Though it has faced more intolerance, the Jewish population of Australia is around one-eighth the size of the Muslim population, and has been stagnant or declining while the percentage of Muslims has grown. In 2016, Jewish Australians made up 0.5% of the population, according to Monash University. Muslims made up 2.6% of the population in 2016, according to the University of South Australia. Today, Muslims account for 3.2% of the Australian population while 0.4% of the population is Jewish.  In the aftermath of recent attacks, Albanese stated that the Australian Federal Police will be conducting an operation that would ""focus on threats, violence, and hatred"" targeting the Jewish community. Reuters reported that Albanese has allocated $25 million (approximately U.S. $15 million) since 2022 to increase security for Jewish organizations. He has also worked to minimize hate speech and banned the Nazi salute.  Many Jewish Australians believe these efforts are not enough. Earlier this month, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) sent an open letter to Albanese, which it shared with Fox News Digital. The ECAJ explained that ""the very character of this country as a free, democratic and multicultural society is in peril,"" citing the ""fear and anxiety"" experienced by Jewish Australians who question whether it is safe to display signs of their Judaism or publicly celebrate their faith and heritage.  Though the ECAJ expressed gratitude to Albanese for ""swiftly condemning"" the arson in Melbourne, they requested that he act in response to ""what is now a national antisemitism crisis."" Among their requests are an increase in security funding, support for antisemitism education in schools, enforcement of laws against harassment and intimidation, and support for higher government efforts to curtail antisemitism in universities.  COLUMBIA GROUP’S ANTISEMITIC NEWSPAPER DRAWS OUTRAGE FROM NY LAWMAKER, AS UNIVERSITY INVESTIGATES  Albanese’s office did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment about criticisms of the prime minister’s reaction to the Melbourne firebombing, his response to the ECAJ’s letter, and whether the country’s shift regarding a Palestinian state might have an impact on the state of antisemitic hate in Australia.  As it has worldwide, antisemitism has risen dramatically in Australia since Oct. 7, according to an ECAJ report from November 2024. Reporting entities counted 2,062 antisemitic incidents in Australia between Oct. 1, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 495 incidents tallied during the prior 12 months. This represents a 316% increase in expressions of anti-Jewish hate, which began as early as Oct. 8, when the ECAJ reported that Sheikh Ibrahim Daoud told an audience in western Sydney that he was ""elated,"" explaining, ""it’s a day of pride, it’s a day of victory.""  The ECAJ sent Fox News Digital a trove of photographs showing acts of hate directed against Jewish Australians. These included an incident from November 2023, when unknown individuals sprayed ""Kill Jews"" and ""Jew lives here"" on a residential unit in southeast Melbourne, and wrote ""Jew-free zone"" in a Brunswick window, as reported by the Jewish Independent.  The government responded to some major acts of antisemitism. In February, anti-Israel activists released a document featuring the ""names and other personal details"" of 600 Jewish musicians, writers, academics and artists in a WhatsApp group whose communications were also leaked.  Seven months later, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus announced a proposed sentence of up to six years in prison for those who release individuals’ private details in order to cause harm. The punishment would increase to seven years if a victim was targeted because of their race, religion or sexual orientation, among other factors.  In recognition of the rising intolerance in Australia, on Dec. 9, the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory warning Jews to ""exercise extreme caution"" if visiting the country. As Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the center’s director of global social action, explained, authorities there have failed ""to stand up against persistent demonization, harassment and violence against Jews and Jewish institutions in Australia.""

Several videos posted to social media showed the former boxing champion surrounded by a group of people while shopping at Hatton Gardens in London. The crowd, seemingly more agitated, followed Mayweather into the street.  Videos showed the angry group shouting expletives as Mayweather’s security attempted to get him into a black SUV and away from the scene.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  According to reports, it was Mayweather’s support of Israel that agitated the crowd.  A source told The Sun that someone had questioned Mayweather over his support while shopping, to which the American boxer doubled down. The source added that someone then ""took a swing"" at Mayweather.  ""Floyd took a few hits during it, but his security was trying to push people back,"" the source told the outlet.  FLOYD MAYWEATHER SHARES MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AFTER HAMAS ATTACKS: 'I STAND WITH ISRAEL'  Floyd addressed the reports with a statement posted to Instagram on Tuesday. He denied being ""touched in any way.""  ""Let me set the record straight... there's no truth to the rumors going around. I wasn't punched or touched in any way. What you're seeing is just my security doing their job to keep things under control.  ""I was in the UK for a quick 48-hour stop to do some shopping, and unfortunately, people let jealousy and negativity fuel false stories,"" he continued. ""I'm perfectly fine, and there's really nothing more to it.""

""​​Over the next year, every orphan in Israel will be visited by the Floyd Mobile and receive special birthday gifts. To all the widows and orphans: keep your heads held high as we honor the cherished memories of those who have passed,"" he wrote in a post on Instagram.  Mayweather, 47, has been outspoken about his support for Israel. He has taken several trips there and in October met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .  ""It was an honor to meet with you today. Your strength and courage are unmatched, and your commitment to protecting the Jewish people and citizens of Israel is truly inspiring. Keep using your voice and never back down,"" he said in a post at the time.  ""This week in Israel has been deeply emotional for me. Visiting injured soldiers, meeting families of fallen heroes, and connecting with the people of Israel has been a humbling experience."""
https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-wants-establish-relations-syria-says-attack-becomes-threat,Fox News,right,Japan,Netanyahu wants to establish ‘relations’ with Syria but says Israel will attack it if becomes a threat,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday he wants to establish ""relations"" with the new regime in Syria after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, but he warned Israel will not hesitate to attack the Middle Eastern nation should it pose a threat.  ""We want relations with the new regime in Syria,"" Netanyahu said in a live address. ""But if this regime allows Iran to return to establishing itself in Syria or allows the transfer of Iranian weapons or any other weapons to Hezbollah or [if it] attack[s] us, we will respond strongly. And we will exact a heavy price.  ""What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this regime.""  ISRAEL DEPLOYS PARATROOPERS TO SYRIA IN 'DEFENSE ACTIVITIES' AFTER FALL OF ASSAD  It remains unclear who exactly will take over the leadership of Syria or what that government will look like now that rebel forces control Damascus.  Overnight on Monday, Israel launched massive strikes against Syrian military targets, including two Syrian naval sites, the Al-Bayda port and the Latakia port, where 15 Syrian naval vessels were docked, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed Tuesday afternoon.  ""Manned aircraft flew hundreds of hours over Syrian airspace, conducting over 350 aerial strikes together with fighter jets,"" the IDF reported.  Israel said a ""wide range of targets were struck"" including anti-aircraft batteries, Syrian Air Force airfields and dozens of weapons depot sites in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyr that housed sophisticated weaponry like ballistic and cruise missiles, UAVs, fighter jets, attack helicopters and tanks.  Netanyahu appeared to claim the strikes were similar to actions taken by Britain during World War II when it bombed a French fleet at the Algerian port of Mers-el-Kébir to prevent the ships from falling into the hands of the Nazis.  NETANYAHU HAILS 'HISTORIC' FALL OF BASHAR ASSAD IN SYRIA, CREDITS ISRAELI ATTACKS ON HEZBOLLAH, IRAN  It is unclear if any casualties were inflicted in Israel’s overnight strikes, though the United Nations on Tuesday condemned the attacks as well as Israel’s military encroachment beyond the Golan Heights and into a demilitarized buffer zone.  ""We are continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. This needs to stop,"" U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen said, calling Israel’s developments ""troubling.""  ""This is extremely important,"" he added. ""We need to see a stop to the Israeli attacks, and we need to make sure that the conflict in the northeast stops. And we need to make sure that there are no conflicts developing between the different armed groups.""  Israel received some international criticism after it sent a military contingent this week beyond the Golan Heights, a contested area that Jerusalem seized in 1967 and which is still internationally recognized as a part of Syria, though the U.S. recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the area.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  ""We're against these types of attacks. I think this is a turning point for Syria. It should not be used by its neighbors to encroach on the territory of Syria,"" U.N. spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric reportedly said Tuesday.  In his address, Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s position and said, ""We have no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of Syria, but we clearly have the intention of doing what is necessary to ensure our security."""
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-pardon-shielded-own-actions-criminal-enterprise,Fox News,right,Japan,Biden’s three biggest lies about his family’s shady business dealings,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!  President Joe Biden lied from start to finish about his family’s influence-peddling racket. He recently issued a sweeping pardon to his son, Hunter Biden, contradicting his repeated assurances that he would not interfere. This pardon may be one of the most comprehensive in U.S. history, encompassing over a decade of corruption. While some have drawn parallels between this pardon and President Gerald Ford’s pardon of former President Richard Nixon, the comparison falls short. Ford aimed to heal a divided nation; Biden is shielding himself and his family from accountability.  Unlike the corporate media and Democrats, who sought to shield Biden until his political future was doomed, observers of the Biden crime family’s corrupt practices are unsurprised by this latest contradiction. Biden’s claim that he would not pardon Hunter Biden is part of a broader pattern of deception regarding his family’s business dealings in order to conceal his involvement.  At the start of this Congress, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee launched an investigation into Joe Biden’s involvement in his family’s business dealings. Despite stonewalling from the Biden administration, we followed the Bidens’ money trail, exposing the 20 shell companies they set up to hide the shady foreign payments they received, all with Joe Biden at the center of the family business.  DEMOCRATS FRUSTRATED BY HUNTER PARDON CONSIDER WITHHOLDING FUTURE BIDEN PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DONATIONS: REPORT  Our investigation has exposed how Joe Biden lied repeatedly about his involvement in these schemes that enriched the Bidens to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Here are some of the biggest lies that we exposed during our investigation.  1. Hunter Biden laptop as Russian disinformation  In October 2020, days before the presidential election, the Biden campaign and now Secretary of State Antony Blinken, orchestrated a misinformation campaign to discredit the contents of Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop, including evidence of Joe Biden’s involvement in his influence-peddling schemes.  These disgraced 51 former intelligence officials claimed the laptop contained all the hallmarks of Russian disinformation, and Joe Biden parroted their claim during the 2020 presidential debate. Twitter removed the New York Post’s article about the laptop, even though former Twitter executives admitted before our committee that it did not violate the platform's policies.  We now know from the testimony of IRS whistleblower, Gary Shapley, that the FBI verified the authenticity of Hunter Biden’s laptop in November 2019. Special Counsel David Weiss, who led the federal criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, also used the laptop as evidence in court.  2. ‘I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings’  Biden repeatedly claimed he never discussed his son’s business dealings. However, evidence uncovered during our investigation contradicts this assertion. Evidence obtained by our committee reveals then-Vice President Biden spoke, dined or had coffee with nearly all of Hunter Biden’s foreign business associates.  Devon Archer, a Biden family associate, confirmed during a transcribed interview that when Joe Biden was Vice President, Joe Biden variously dined with Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina, Kazakhstani oligarch Kenes Rakishev, and Burisma’s corporate secretary Vadym Pozharsky at Café Milano in Washington, D.C.  These dinners occurred as the foreign nationals or their affiliated entities were collectively paying Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, millions of dollars. Then-Vice President Joe Biden also met with Jonathan Li, a Chinese national who was Hunter Biden’s associate, and wrote a college letter of recommendation for his daughter. Even when presented with this evidence, President Biden continued to lie to the American people.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION  Rob Walker, a Biden family associate who was involved in the Biden’s dealings with Chinese and Romanian entities, confirmed during a transcribed interview that Joe Biden met with the now-missing Chairman of CEFC Ye Jianming as Hunter Biden and his associates received $3 million from a Chinese entity CEFC controlled.  Jason Galanis, another Biden family business associate, testified that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone with Yelena Baturina. Joe Biden ended the call by stating, ""Ok then, you be good to my boy."" A few days later, Baturina committed to a ""hard order"" of $10-20 million to an entity benefitting Hunter Biden.  Biden repeatedly claimed he never discussed his son’s business dealings. However, evidence uncovered during our investigation contradicts this assertion. Evidence obtained by our committee reveals then-Vice President Biden spoke, dined or had coffee with nearly all of Hunter Biden’s foreign business associates.  3. ""My son has not made money … in China""  During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden told the American people that his son did not make money in China. However, our investigation has uncovered that Hunter Biden and other Biden family members received millions from China for unknown services.  Additionally, we traced how $40,000 in Chinese money landed in Joe Biden’s personal bank account. When confronted with the fact that his family did indeed receive money from China, President Biden lied again and said it was not true that his family received money from China.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As the truth came out during our investigation, the Biden camp tried to move the goalposts from Joe ""never spoke"" with his son about his business dealings to ""the president was never in business with his son."" All these lies have been committed to hide the fact that Joe Biden was the family business. At a hearing, where former Biden family associates were under oath, they confirmed Joe Biden’s involvement in his family’s business and that he was ""the brand.""  IRS whistleblowers, Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, confirmed under oath that the Department of Justice prohibited them from following evidence that would have led to Joe Biden. Joe Biden has long prided himself on his integrity, yet his legacy will be defined by his repeated falsehoods. Joe Biden has lied for a living."
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/assad-arrives-moscow-granted-asylum-russia,Fox News,right,Japan,"Assad arrives in Moscow, is granted asylum by Russia","Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, who fled the country Saturday as rebels closed in on the capital of Damascus, has arrived in Moscow and has been granted asylum by the Russian government, according to Russian News Agency Tass.  Speculation about where Assad might land has been widespread since the longtime dictator fled the country, with allies such as Iran and Russia being at the top of the list.  TRUMP URGES US TO STAY OUT OF SYRIAN CIVIL WAR, BLAMING OBAMA FOR FAILURE AS ISLAMISTS CLOSE IN ON CAPITAL  Assad was forced to flee the country after a coalition of largely radical Islamist groups led a sweeping offensive across Syria, culminating in the capture of the country's capital city and the fall of Assad's regime, which had seen his family rule Syria for over 50 years.  The offensive was the latest development in a bloody civil war that has ravaged Syria for almost 14 years, a war that also led to the rise of the Islamic State terrorist organization and yearslong interventions by countries such as the United States, Russia, Iran and Turkey.  ISLAMIST REBELS IN SYRIA CATCH ASSAD, PUTIN, IRAN REGIMES OFF GUARD GIVING US NEW MIDEAST HEADACHE  Assad has been a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had for more than a decade dedicated military resources to the defense of Assad's regime and its government forces.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/kosovo-accuses-serbia-terrorist-attack-resembling-russian-actions-ukraine,Fox News,right,Japan,Kosovo accuses Serbia of 'terrorist attack' resembling Russian actions in Ukraine,"The Kosovo government has accused Serbia of blowing up a crucial pipeline that supplies water and electricity to the ethnically Serb population in the north of Kosovo. Even more troubling, some in Kosovo claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have even had a hand in it.  ""Serbia acts as a key player in the Kremlin’s bid for chaos in the Balkans, so Putin can have leverage over Western powers who do not want the violence to escalate further,"" Ivana Stradner, research fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.  Russia has deep historical, cultural and religious connections to the Balkans, and narratives sympathetic to Russia often emanate from the Serbian Orthodox Church. Stradner says Putin exploits these religious and ethnic divisions in the Balkans, pushing the region to the brink of war. She also noted that the Serbian president also benefits from chaos in the Balkans, using it to strengthen his grip on power.  TENSIONS RISE AMID CLAIMS OF RUSSIA, SERBIA INTERFERENCE IN KOSOVO FOLLOWING RECENT BLOODSHED  ""Vucic has employed a strategy of escalating and de-escalating crises in Kosovo to portray himself as a source of stability, leveraging his position as a bargaining chip with the West,"" Stradner added.  Agim Nesho, former Albanian ambassador to the U.S. and the United Nations, told Fox News Digital that, ""Russia has openly stated that it wants the Western Balkans to be a neutral region and finds it difficult to accept that most Balkan countries are NATO members.""  He continued, ""Events in Montenegro, the assassination attempt on President Djukanović, and the rise of pro-Russian parties show that Russia is present. Russia has no support in Kosovo and Albania, which are openly pro-American due to the role of the USA in supporting the Albanian nation since the beginning of the last century.""  Some experts are cautious as accusations and information is often fluid following crises in the Balkans.  ""This latest escalation, much like the previous ones, involves serious allegations - ranging from Kosovo’s claim that the Serbian government orchestrated these events to suspicions of Russian involvement,"" Helena Ivanov, associate fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital.  Ivanov warned that previous rounds of escalation and allegations lacked concrete evidence and that many of the claims remain conjecture until a full investigation is completed.  Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti said at a news conference that the attack on critical infrastructure was similar to Russia's actions targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine. So far, there is no evidence to suggest Russia had any involvement.  Kurti placed the blame squarely on Serbia and President Vucic for plotting what Kosovo is calling a terrorist attack on the water supply canal in the northern town of Zubin Potok.  ZELENSKYY WARNS RUSSIA WANTS TO CAUSE 'EXPLOSION' IN THE BALKANS  ""All evidence reveals a continuation of Serbia's strategy of aggression, with the Vučić regime exploiting a plethora of resources, including ties with organized crime, in their effort to inflict harm and cause instability within Kosovo,"" Ilir Dugolli, Kosovo’s ambassador to the U.S., told Fox News Digital.  ""This is only the latest in the long list of acts of aggression by Serbia,"" the ambassador added.  Approximately 20 kilos of explosives were used in the massive blast in what Ambassador Dugolli called a highly sophisticated manner, further indicating the professional preparation and execution of the operation.  President Vucic adamantly denied the accusations, calling them ""baseless.""  Vucic claimed in a post on Instagram that the accusations against Serbia are intended to tarnish Serbia’s international reputation and undermine stability in the Balkans region. The president is also calling for a ""thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation"" into what he called an act of sabotage.  Serbian Foreign Minister Marko Djuric told Fox News Digital that the sabotage that took place in the north of Kosovo is a serious threat to peace and stability, and he reiterated Vucic’s demand for a thorough investigation under international supervision.  LONGTIME FOES SERBIA AND KOSOVO NEARING NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS  Djuric also repeated Vucic’s claims that the aims of the operation were to discredit Serbia.  ""We have grounds to believe that this was a hybrid attack aimed at discrediting Serbia, and that is why we continue to emphasize that it is in our immediate interest to identify the perpetrators and masterminds behind this attack,"" Djuric told Fox News Digital.  Djuric suggested that Kurti could be behind the attack, but did not back up the claim with evidence, but he also made sure to point out that Serbia was ready to offer any assistance to the investigation.  Kosovo’s Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla said that eight suspects linked to the attack were arrested and that the damage to the canal had been fixed. Svecla also said that Kosovo police raided 10 locations and confiscated uniforms, heavy weaponry and other military equipment.  Kurti and Vucic met with the European Union’s new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas in Brussels. Kallas said in a post on X that the only way to EU membership for both parties is through normalization of their relations.  Both Serbia and Kosovo are EU aspirants, and ending their feud is a core requirement for gaining membership. Failure to honor their obligations or ratcheting up tensions will have negative consequences for their EU accession processes and block any potential EU financial aid. The ongoing dispute and the recent turmoil remain major obstacles to EU membership for both.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Conflict between Serbia and Kosovo following the 1999 war is unresolved and is a roadblock to their normalization process. Kosovo was a former province of Serbia and was once integrated within the nation of Yugoslavia. NATO led a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, which comprised Serbia and Montenegro, to defend Kosovo’s ethnic Albanians against violence from Belgrade. Nearly a decade later, in 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, along with its historic patron, Russia, refuses to recognize its independence.  Tensions are especially fought in the north of Kosovo, where ethnic Serbs make up a majority of the territory and refuse to recognize Kosovo’s independence. Serbs in northern Kosovo still look to Belgrade as their capital."

In what came to be known as the kids-for-cash scandal, former Judge Michael Conahan shut down a county-run juvenile detention center and shared $2.8 million in illegal payments from the builder and co-owner of two for-profit lockups. Another judge, Mark Ciavarella, was also involved in the illicit scheme , the effects of which are still felt today among victims and families.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-zealand-scientists-suspect-specimen-worlds-rarest-whale-died-head-injuries,Fox News,right,Japan,New Zealand scientists suspect specimen of world’s rarest whale died from head injuries,"Scientists suspect the first complete specimen ever recorded of the world’s rarest whale died from head injuries, an expert said Friday.  The first dissection of a spade-toothed whale, a type of beaked whale, was completed last week after a painstaking examination at a research center near the New Zealand city of Dunedin, the local people who led the scientific team, Te Rūnanga Ōtākou, said in a statement issued by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.  WHALE CAUGHT ON CAMERA SURPRISING NEW YORK CITY RESIDENTS DURING SWIM NEAR BROOKLYN  A near-perfectly preserved 5-meter (16-foot) male was found washed up on a South Island beach in July. It was the first complete specimen ever recorded. There have only been seven known sightings and never of a living spade-toothed whale.  New Zealand conservation agency beaked whale expert Anton van Helden said the whale’s broken jaw and bruising to the head and neck led scientists to believe that head trauma may have caused its death.  ""We don’t know, but we suspect there must have been some sort of trauma, but what caused that could be anyone’s guess,"" van Helden said in a statement.  All varieties of beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers didn’t know how the spade-toothed type processed its food.  The scientific team found the specimen had nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, the statement said.  Among the more interesting finds were tiny vestigial teeth in the upper jaw.  ""These little teeth embedded in the gum tells us something about their evolutionary history. It’s remarkable to see this and it’s just another thing that we had no idea about,"" van Helden said.  ""It’s a week I’ll never forget in my life, it’s certainly a highlight and it’s the start of the storytelling around this beautiful animal,"" van Helden added.  The dissection was also notable because scientists and curators worked together with local Māori people to incorporate Indigenous knowledge and customs into each step of the process.  Following the dissection, the local iwi, or tribe, will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts retained by the iwi.  To Māori, whales are a taonga -– a precious treasure -– and the creature has been treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation.  The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand’s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile’s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/frances-macron-names-centrist-ally-bayrou-next-prime-minister,Fox News,right,Japan,France's Macron names centrist ally Bayrou as next prime minister,"French President Emmanuel Macron named centrist ally François Bayrou as prime minister, after a historic parliamentary vote ousted the previous government.  Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned last week following a no-confidence vote, leaving France without a functioning government.  Bayrou leads the centrist Democratic Movement, known as MoDem, which he founded in 2007.  French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday named centrist ally François Bayrou as prime minister, after a historic parliamentary vote ousted the previous government last week.  Bayrou, 73, a crucial partner in Macron’s centrist alliance, has been a well-known figure in French politics for decades. His political experience is seen as key in efforts to restore stability as no single party holds a majority at the National Assembly.  Macron’s office said in a statement that Bayrou ""has been charged with forming a new government.""  SOCIAL MEDIA REACTS TO TRUMP 'DOMINATING WORLD LEADERS' WITH MACRON HANDSHAKE DURING MEETING IN FRANCE  Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned last week following a no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly, leaving France without a functioning government.  Macron in an address to the nation vowed to remain in office until his term ends in 2027.  Macron’s centrist alliance does not have a majority in parliament and Bayrou's Cabinet will need to rely on moderate lawmakers from the left and the right to be able to stay in power. Some conservatives are expected to be part of the new government.  Macron’s strategy aims at preventing far-right leader Marine Le Pen from holding ""make or break"" power over the government. Le Pen helped oust Barnier by joining her National Rally party’s forces to the left to pass the no-confidence motion last week.  Bayrou's appointment is also in line with Macron’s efforts to build a non-aggression pact with the Socialists so that they commit not to vote against the government in any future confidence motion.  Bayrou leads the centrist Democratic Movement, known as MoDem, which he founded in 2007.  In 2017, he supported Macron’s first presidential bid and became a weighty partner in the French president’s centrist alliance.  At the time, he was appointed justice minister, but he quickly resigned from the government amid an investigation into the MoDem’s alleged embezzlement of European Parliament funds.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Bayrou this year was cleared in the case by a Paris court, which found eight other party officials guilty and sentenced the party to pay a fine.  Bayrou became well known to the French public when he was education minister from 1993 to 1997 in a conservative government.  He was three times a candidate for president, in 2002, 2007 and 2012."

https://www.foxnews.com/world/syrias-liberated-political-prisons-reveal-grim-reality-bashar-assads-regime-torture,Fox News,right,Japan,Syria's liberated political prisons reveal grim reality of Bashar Assad's regime of torture,"Former Syrian President Bashar Assad's brutal regime of imprisonment and torture is on full display this week as victorious rebels dig through the dictator's now-liberated political prisons.  Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani vowed to dissolve the Assad regime's remnant security forces as well as close prisons that had been used to house political dissidents.  Thousands of Syrians stormed Assad's various prison facilities across the country as his regime fell in hopes of releasing their incarcerated friends and family members. Thousands were released alive, but others were found dead and still others remain missing.  U.S. prosecutors named two Syrian officials who they say ran a torture facility at Mezzeh air force base in the Syrian capital, Damascus. The U.S. alleges that their victims included political prisoners, peaceful protesters and a 26-year-old American woman who was later believed to have been executed.  TRUMP URGES US TO STAY OUT OF SYRIAN CIVIL WAR, BLAMING OBAMA FOR FAILURE AS ISLAMISTS CLOSE IN ON CAPITAL  The U.S. indictment names Jamil Hassan, director of the Syrian air force’s intelligence branch, who prosecutors say oversaw a prison and torture center at the Mezzeh air force base in the capital, Damascus, and Abdul Salam Mahmoud, who prosecutors say ran the prison.  The most notorious of Assad's prison facilities was Saydnaya Prison, however, which lies just outside Damascus.  ISLAMIST REBELS IN SYRIA CATCH ASSAD, PUTIN, IRAN REGIMES OFF GUARD GIVING US NEW MIDEAST HEADACHE  Syrian citizens have flocked to the prison in the days since Assad's fall on Sunday, breaking open cells and scouring what images reveal to be a labyrinthine prison. While dozens were freed on Sunday, virtually no one has been found since.  ""Where is everyone? Where are everyone’s children? Where are they?"" said Ghada Assad, breaking down in tears.  Syrians are continuing to search the facility, however, searching for hidden cells as well as documents that might shed light on their family members' fates.  ASSAD ARRIVES IN MOSCOW, IS GRANTED ASYLUM BY RUSSIA  ""There is not a home, there is not a woman in Syria who didn’t lose a brother, a child or a husband,"" said Khairiya Ismail, 54, said of the prison and Assad's rule.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  An estimated 150,000 people were detained or went missing in Syria since 2011. Tens of thousands of them are believed to have gone through Saydnaya, according to the Associated Press.  Amnesty International estimated that there were between 10,000 and 20,000 people being held in the prison as of 2017. The organization also claimed that there were routine mass executions.  The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-group-looks-kidnapped-americans-syria-after-fall-assad-regime-wont-leave-stone-unturned,Fox News,right,Japan,US group looks for kidnapped Americans in Syria after fall of Assad regime: won't 'leave a stone unturned',"A U.S. nonprofit headquartered in Washington, D.C., is on the ground in Syria looking for kidnapped Americans in the aftermath of the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force (SETF), told Fox News Digital in an interview from Damascus that he and six members of his team arrived in the capital Wednesday to look for Americans kidnapped or held captive by the ousted Assad regime, most notably, American freelance journalist Austin Tice and Syrian American psychotherapist Dr. Majd Kamalmaz.  ""God willing, he's alive. God willing, we can find him and bring him home,"" Moustafa said of Tice. ""Same for Majd, same for the other Americans whose names are not public.""  Tice, who traveled to Syria as the country’s civil war was erupting, was kidnapped in 2012 while reporting in Daraya, a Damascus suburb. He was seen on a video released months after his capture wearing a black blindfold and being led away by a group of men shouting ""Allahu Akbar.""  Tice has not been seen or heard from since. The Syrian government has always denied holding Tice or other Americans.  Kamalmaz, a U.S. citizen who helped survivors of Hurricane Katrina and refugees from war-torn Syria and Kosovo recover from trauma and PTSD, was detained at a government checkpoint in Damascus while visiting a family member in February 2017.  U.S. officials presented the Kamalmaz family with classified information earlier this year, saying they believe the humanitarian died in Syria’s notorious prison system .  He likely died within a year or two of his detainment, his daughter Maryam told Fox News Digital in June, citing U.S. officials. The officials did not say how or where Dr. Kamalmaz died.  ""We will not leave a stone unturned while I'm here in Damascus, and I hope to find them,"" said Moustafa.  ASSAD ARRIVES IN MOSCOW, IS GRANTED ASYLUM BY RUSSIA  The SETF leader has several geolocations from sources and tips and has dispatched his team to specific locations in search of Tice .  ""Now that Damascus is free, we have no restrictions. We can go anywhere,"" he added.  Moustafa praised Tice for his bravery and for traveling to Syria to report on the country’s brutal civil war and cover the plight of civilians in the early years of the outbreak.  ""The very least that we can do is to look for him . And for a long time, we could only look for him through calling people, trying to find people that had been – that had come out of detention, seeing if they've seen him,"" he told Fox News Digital.  Joel Rayburn, the former U.S. special envoy for Syria, told Fox News Digital earlier this year the ousted Assad regime viewed Tice and other detainees as ""cards"" to use as leverage and to get concessions.  ""We know it's almost certain that they have them in their custody, or they've had them in their custody, or they know definitively what happened to those people, but they're absolutely not forthcoming,"" Rayburn said.  The U.S. State Department is now offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on Tice and has conveyed to the leading Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that finding the journalist remains a top priority.  ""In all of our communications with parties that we know talk to HTS, we have sent very clearly the message that, as they move through Syria liberating prisons, that our top priority is the return of Austin Tice,"" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.  A Syrian journalist who was imprisoned by the Assad regime claims he was detained in a Damascus jail in the Kafr Sousa neighborhood with Tice at the same time until as recently as 2022, according to a report from The Sunday Times.  AUSTIN TICE: FAMILY OF JOURNALIST KIDNAPPED IN SYRIA 12 YEARS AGO SAY HE'S STILL ALIVE, CITING ‘VETTED’ SOURCE  Moustafa told Fox News Digital he was aware of the article and plans to go ""straight there"" in the coming days to find out more information.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  ""It is every Syrian's job to do everything they can to get Austin back to his mother and his father, to his country, to his home,"" he said."
