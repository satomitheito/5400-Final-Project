About this site


When conducting sentiment analysis on English and Japanese articles, we would need to be able to detect the language disparity. 

### Sentiment Analysis for English 
We conducted VADER, a lexicon and rule based model, sentiment analysis for English articles. The **SentimentIntensityAnalyzer** from the **nltk** library is used. 
- This provides scores such as the percentage of positive, negative, and neurtal words in the given text as well as a compound score, which is the aggregated score of all three probabilities. 

### Sentiment Analysis for Japanese
From Hugging Face, a pre-trained BERT model which was fine-tuned for sentiment analysis was used.
- To tokenize our text, we used **BertJapaneseTokenizer**.
- The BERT model generates logits, raw and unnormalized scores, which needs to be ran through a softmax function. 
- This softmax function then generates the likelihood of the text being positive, negative, and neutral. 
- The compound score is then calcualted by the weight of the sum of all likelihoods.
