The SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the nltk library is used. - This provides scores such as the percentage of positive, negative, and neurtal words in the given text as well as a compound score, which is the aggregated score of all three probabilities.\n\n\nSentiment Analysis for Japanese\nFrom Hugging Face, a pre-trained BERT model which was fine-tuned for sentiment analysis was used. - To tokenize our text, we used BertJapaneseTokenizer. - The BERT model generates logits, raw and unnormalized scores, which needs to be ran through a softmax function. - This softmax function then generates the likelihood of the text being positive, negative, and neutral. - The compound score is then calcualted by the weight of the sum of all likelihoods."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As news spheres exist independently across nations, we’re currently left to wonder if certain events and topics beyond borders are portrayed in a similar light. Understanding the portrayals can provide a deeper insight into cross-cultural communication.\nRecent work has shown that sentiment analysis can reveal how media from different countries depict similar topics. For example, in the study “Comparative Analysis of Japan and the US Cybersecurity Related Newspaper Articles” by Piyush Ghasiya and Koji Okamura, they utilized NLP and machine learning techniques to compare sentiment in cybersecurity articles from Japan and US newspapers. Their findings highlight how cultural and political differences shape media coverage, even when the topic is shared between two countries (Ghasiya and Okamura 2020). Additionally, an analysis of US media showed significant sentiment variation by topics: articles on Huawei and China were 91.8% positive, while coverage of Facebook and Russia had 57.2% negative sentiment. These key findings highlight the importance of topic-specific analysis and political sentiments.\nIn order to bridge this gap in Natural Language Processing (NLP_, our team decided to continue further comparative sentiment analysis. Thus, allow us to introduce JANAS, a Japanese and American News Analysis through Sentiment. Through JANAS, we focus on multilingual sentiment across the US and Japan as it relates to news portrayals of similar topics. Mainly, we’d consider those tabs you see on everyday news: Trending news, Politics, Business, etc. This motivation permits us to investigate the sentimental portrayal of these topics with the goal of comparative analysis and real-time data manipulation. Our package scrapes the internet of various sources to provide the most recent stories regarding these topics, creating a dataset containing attributes available to the user for their own analysis.\nAs a result, through web scraping, translations, and deep learning sentiment analysis, we hope to provide a snapshot of an empirical review towards gaining an understanding of how the US and Japan portray news in the media."

    "text": "Compound Scores Across Countries\n\n  \n\n\nAs seen in the figures above, you can notice that the scatterplot makes note of where the compound scores are the most dense within each country and the topic the articles are exploring. For example, in the first graph detailing how English articles portrayed certain topics, you’ll notice that there weren’t a lot of neutral-classified articles, meaning the sources pertaining to these topics were quite critical or emotional in some regard. Whereas, the Japanese articles tend to be more centralized in the neutral territories, with some outliers like the trending articles.\nOverall, we can start to get a glimpse at how our sentiment scores are distributed across the two countries.\n\n\nCountry Sentiment at a Glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanationObservationsInsights\n\n\n\nThis graph showcases a direct comparison of the average compound scross across the two languages and their news sources. Notice, we only scraped topics from the opposing countries’ views. In other words, we only have Japanese articles discussing America and American articles discussing Japan. This not only allows us to view topics with a direct comparison, but a more interesting question about how the other country is portrayed.\n\n\n\n\nAt this point in time, news in both America and Japan was fairly neutral, with the outlier of Japanese articles discussing international topics. There was a significantly low average when it came to international topics being discussed by Japan. Scores tended to center on a range of -0.2 to 0.1, which by our scores are very neutral, on average.\n\n\n\n\nThis indicates that the news around this time wasn’t as critical, or gave more of a holistic, non-emotional standpoint of the topics at hand. However, the outlier of the Japanese articles having to do with international topics could be correlated to current events. I.e., South Korea had just declared martial law and was in a state of chaos around the time this particular set of data was scraped, and thus, a lot of the international articles discussed that topic specifically, and a lot in a negative manner. Analysis like this allows us to gain a clearer picture of not just the media portrayals themselves, but how they explain current events around us, and the perception these news outlets are scripting onto them."

    "text": "Sentiment Scores by Bias\n\nAmerican ArticlesJapanese Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the distribution of compound sentiment scores in american news outlets, we can gain a couple of takeaways. Firstly, confirmed by the previous section of analysis, American news sources tended to be very emotional, as shown by the extreme distributions, skewed either positively or negatively. Whereas, we can now see that the left and right-leaning news sources are particularly critical at this time. The neutral sources we used was more satirical, or positive, in this case. Across the spectrum, we don’t see a lot of neutral-leaning arguments, which we found very interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposingly, looking at the Japanese articles reveals quite a different set of results. Here, we still get a wide range of scores, but the distributions of all the news sources in Japan tend to lean more negatives. Although, their center is around neutral territory, so even though all political sources are pretty consistent in their reporting, they also tend to have similar sentimental patters, at least during this news cycle period.\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Article Bias at a Glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanationObservationsInsights\n\n\n\nOur graph displays a violin plot to gain a holistic and empirical view of the densities in each countries’ news sources, across the political spectrum during this news cycle.\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the blue density parts of the violin plot, having to do with Japanese articles, we see peaks in the distribution around scores of 0, with some variation or smaller peaks around lower scores. On the contrary, the American sources, indicated by the orange density plots, tended to be centered either around the negative compound scores (like shown in the left-leaning sources), positive compound scores (like shown in the center/neutral sources), or both (like shown in the right-leaning sources).\n\n\n\n\nAmerican news sources play on people’s emotions, whether they listen to negativity, positivity, or both. It’s not shocking that emotionally-charged media is what tends to draw eyes, as many studies have shown this to be true, and it’s nice to see that graphed out here in our analysis. We were quite shocked at how different this was compared to the Japanese news sources, and they typically congregated around a neutral standpoint, with a few outliers, of course. This may be due to Japan’s strict media potrayal restrictions."

    "title": "Sentiment Analysis",
    "section": "Across Translation",
    "text": "Across Translation\nAs this team contains individuals who can speak Japanese (Trey & Satomi), this project had more to do than just compare America vs. Japan and their new source’s sentiment or how certain topics were portrayed. A crucial NLP dilemma is the thought of translation, and creating a scalable solution to bridge the gap in linguistical differences beyond borders.\n\nThis is another question we kept in mind to investigate as a part of this project. How much does sentiment scores differ across translated news?.\n\nUtilizing Hugging Face (detailed out here), we were able to gain translations of our Japanese articles, and filter them through two different sentiment algorithms, comparing the differences in their scores. The insights, analysis, and takeaways can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to capture how different the two sentiment scores were between the two, we took their direct differences and plotted that kernel density above. Although a lot of our articles didn’t have much of a difference, indicated by the right-skew and high density towards lower differences in their scores, that doesn’t mean there wasn’t a difference at all. There were quite a lot of articles that indicated a change in difference when converting languages, some even up to 2 points, which is an entire emotion. That means there were articles that switched emotions, losing a lot of linguistic power and explainability when utilizing translation efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at these direct scores side-by-side in the above bar char, we can see a lot of these differences across sources directly. Looking to how the translations differ, we can see that intiially, the Japanese articles (in Japanese) were quite negative, but we already knew that. What we gain from this graph is that the translations and English sentiment of these Japanese articles is vastly different and event misconstrues this information entirely. For example, our left and central-leaning sources just got classified as more neutral than negative when we translate them. This indicates how nuanced the Japanese language is, and how the translations can’t capture the tonality of some of these statements. That, however, isn’t as serious as the 産経新聞 (Sankei Shinbun) sources, where it takes the negative sentiment, and actually classifies it as positive when looking at the English-translated text. This is quite dangerous territory as can lead to some serious miscommunications between actionable individuals when discussing international ties and relations.\n\n\nThese insights were also checked by Satomi and Trey. We can view this through a specific case-study, or example displayed below. \n\n\nTik Tok Case-Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanationObservationsInsights\n\n\n\nAs a physical example of this, we pulled one of the stories with the biggest change in sentiment and tried to explain why this happened. A majority of these stories were very politically charged. Pictured above is one of the these top stories, discussing the recent (at this time) TikTok appeal, attempting to prevent the United States from banning the popular social media app (source: 毎日新聞 (Mainichi Shinbun, or the left-leaning Japanese newssource)). This bar chart explains how it was specifically classified and the differences in sentimentality.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the article, under our VADER model, the original Japanese text was very negatively charged. This, makes sense, as the Japanese title of this article was TikTokの訴え却下 米高裁、事業禁止法を支持, which if you didn’t know, actually means something along the lines of “TikTok Appeal Rejected, the U.S. Supreme Court upholds anti-business laws and practices”. Reading that, it’s very jarring, targeted, and blunt, retrieving it’s earned negative classification. Whereas, when translated, the topic reads TikTok’s appeal dismissed: U.S. Court supports ban, which is much more passive. This is a prime demonstration in how the multi-faceted nuances of Japanese can literally get lost in translation.\n\n\n\n\nThis means that when it comes to more emotionally-charged material in Japanese, translating the text can be quite dangerous, as you will never get the full picture on any linguistic-related content. More specifically, news sources won’t be as reliable, as its tone will completely change across sources. News is one of the prime spots for information retrieval and current events. Not knowing how to receive this information or what it speaks to about the country or news source as a whole is an NLP gap we need to bridge. This calls to action both the need for much more detailed translating algorithms as well as language training. Without knowing multiple languages, it’s difficult to get the full picture on media portrayal, and relying on shawty translations can lead to miscommunicated and poor insights."
